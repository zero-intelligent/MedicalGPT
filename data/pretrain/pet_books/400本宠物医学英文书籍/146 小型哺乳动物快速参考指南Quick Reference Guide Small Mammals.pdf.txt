Rabbits
PET APPEAL/BEHAVIOR
Quiet animals.
Require relatively little space.
 Engaging personalities.
Because rabbits are most active in the morning and early
evening. they are appropriate pets for people who work
during the day.
Rabbits are generally affectionate and playful and bond
quickly with their owner.
 Rabbits are highly intelligent and need attention and 
mental stimulation to thrive.
It is best when they are housed together as bonded pairs
and trios rather than as single pets.
Athough typically not aggressive, hostile behaviors can
be seen when rabbits are frightened, in pain or expressing
territoriality (especially around other rabbits to which they
are not bonded).

Rabbits
MALE
FEMALE
 There are medical and behavioral reasons to have rabbits
altered.
Neutered male rabbits are less territorial, mark less with
both urine and feces and fight less with other rabbits.
Unspayed female rabbits tend to be more territorial, even
when their hormones are fluctuating. Unspayed female
rabbits over the age of 2 years have an extremely high
rate of reproductive and mammary neoplasia.
Rabbits should be spayed or neutered when they are
approximately 4-6 months old, but older rabbits in good 
health are also good surgical candidates.

Cages should have narrower wire spacing on the bottom
to protect feet from falling through.
 Rabbits kept in wire-bottomed cages should have a
platform made of wood, cardboard or hay to protect their
feet from constant wire pressure.

out length of the rabbit's adult size.

Ferrets
Ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) belong to the family
Mustelidae; their relatives include weasels, mink and
otters. The ferret is suspected to have originated from
the European polecat (Mustela putorius) or steppe
polecat (Mustela eversmanni). They were probably
domesticated for rodent and rabbit control over 1900
years ago. In the Us, the ferret is used primarily as a
companion animal. Regulations on ferret ownership
are controversial. In some states and cities ferret
ownership is illegal, and a license is required in others.
PET APPEAL/BEHAVIOR
Joyful, interactive and entertaining.
Independent, rarely sit still to be cuddled or petted.
Relatively easy to care for.
Quiet compared to other popular companion animals.
Sounds ferrets emit include “clucking" (giggle), hissing
(exuberance, anger), squeaking (pain, surprise, fighting)
and rarely, screaming (extremely frightened, pain).

SCENT OF THE FERRET
While the majority of ferrets in the US are descented
(removal of the anal sacs) at the time of neutering. a
characteristic musky odor always remains.
Some consider anal saculectomy ("descenting") as
unnecessary because anal gland secretions are not
responsible for all of the ferret's musky odor.
 The sebaceous secretions of the skin produce the overall
scent of the ferret and are seasonally influenced.
 Bathing a ferret provides only temporary relief. A better
 alternative is to regularly change the ferret's bedding.
MALE
FEMALE
SEXING AND REPRODUCTION
Ferrets are easily sexed.
Males ("hobs") can be identified by locating the preputial
opening on the ventral abdomen, midway between the
umbilicus and anus.
 In normal males, a distinct white line may be identified

can be readily palpated. Testicles, if present, are located
just ventral and cranial to the anus.
 Females ("jills") have a short anogenital distance, with a
distinct vulva.
 Normal females have a small vulva located approximately
1 cm ventral to the anus.
 Most ferrets in the US are altered and descented before

hammocks or in blankets.
Jills are induced ovulators with a prolonged estrus. If they
do not ovulate, females will remain in estrus and may
develop aplastic anemia.
Jills must be spayed if not intended for breeding.
 Many feret breeders and owners delay gonadectomy until
their ferrets reach puberty.
There may be a link between the age at neutering and
the age of development of adrenal disease in that a lack
of negative feedback from gonadal hormones, as a result
of neutering, results in persistently elevated gonadotropic
luteinizing hormone (LH), which may induce adrenal
hyperplasia and/or neoplasia via functional LH receptors.
 An aberrant tumor suppressor gene has also been
implicated in the development of adrenal hyperplasia and
subsequent neoplasia.
HOUSING
Minimum cage size should be 22 x 20 x 16 inches (55 x
50 x 40 cm) for each ferret.
There are many cages designed for ferrets with multiple
levels and constructed of galvanized metal and plastic.
Foors made of hard plastic are easiest to clean.
 Housing and temporary housing at the veterinary clinic
must be "ferret proofed" to prevent escape.
Cage bedding (e.g., blankets, old sweatshirts) must be
changed and washed regularly in order to control odor.
Ferrets require at least a few hours of exercise outside of
the cage each day.
 The less time a ferret spends outside the cage, the more
space and enrichment is needed inside the cage.

allowed access must be "ferret proofed."
Reclining chairs and rockers pose a danger, as the ferrets
are prone to climb into the chair mechanisms.
Given the opportunity, ferrets will venture outside or get
into hidden spaces in walls and cabinets. Ductwork and
small holes need to be identified and covered.

ORIGIN
Guinea pigs are rodents that originated from South
America. They are related to the chinchilla and porcupine.
 In South America, guinea pigs are often hunted or raised
for meat, but free-ranging animals are not trapped for the
pet trade.
 In the United States, the guinea pig is kept as a pet and 
also used in research.
There are 3 main breeds of guinea pigs: English/common
(with short, straight, fine hair), Abyssinian (rough, wiry
hair in rosettes or whorls), and the Peruvian (long.
straight, silky hair).
Crosses of all breeds result in a wide range of coat colors
and patterns. Pet stores usually sell cross-bred animals,
 but hobbyists breed purebred guinea pigs for shows.
 There are 11 guinea pig breeds recognized in the show
ring, including American/English, white-crested,

Guinea Pigs
Long-haired breeds, like this Peruvian,
need regular grooming to prevent tangles.
Because guinea pigs are social animals, it is best to
house them in pairs or trios rather that singly. As a
solitary pet, it may bond closely to the owner, greeting
him/her with chirps, purrs, squeaks or whistles.
Guinea pigs can learn to get along with other family pets,
e.g., cats, dogs, rabbits, but should not be housed with
these and other animal species that carry Bordeteffa as a

FORMULARY
 Certain antibiotics should not be used in guinea pigs because they may result in dysbiosis/enterotoxemia. Antibiotics responsible for this disruption
tetracyclines. The antibiotics that appear least like to cause disturbances are chloramphenicol, trimethoprim/sulfonamides and fuoroquinolones.
 Probiotic supplements should be administered during any antibiotic treatment and continued for 5 days beyond termination of treatment, although 
there is some controversy regarding the benefit of this therapy.

Hamsters
 The most common hamster species maintained as a
auratus). Others include the Chinese hamster
(Cricetufus griseus) and Siberian (dwarf winter white or
Djungarian) hamster (Phodopus sungorus). The golden
hamster originates from a very limited range in the
Middle East. Today captive breeding facilities supply
the pet and research laboratory markets.
PET POTENTIAL/BEHAVIOR
Cute pets.
 Adapt well to captivity.
Small, do not require a lot of living space.
Relatively inexpensive to maintain.
 Can easily become tame with frequent, gentle handling.
 Nocturnal animals.
 Wwill not tolerate being held still for long.
Hamsters may bite or show aggression in response to
rough handling, sudden disturbances, being around
other hamsters, or when they are pregnant, lactating.

DIET
Young hamsters should be fed a pelleted diet with a
minimum of 16% protein and 4-5% fat.
 Hamsters eat solid food at 7-10 days of age, so food and
water must be accessible for their small size.
 Mature adults thrive on a slightly lower protein level

 A secure wire screen clamped top or other roof is
necessary to prevent escape.
Ideal room temperature should be 65-809F (18-26°℃).
Ideal humidity should be 40-70%.
Because rats are social and need companionship, they
should be maintained in same sex or altered sex groups.

recycled newspaper composite materials or pellets,
hardwood chips or shavings and compressed wheat straw.

DIET
 Rats are omnivorous rodents.
Rat/rodent pellets provide a complete diet. Recommended
brands include Mazuri, ZuPreem and Oxbow Pet Products.
Small amounts of fresh fruits, vegetables may be added.
Seed-based diets are not recommended as they do not
Adults require 5-10 g of pellets per 100 g body weight 
daily and 10 ml of water per 100 g body weight daily.
Fresh water should be available at all times, ideally
provided via a drinking bottle or sipper tube.
Food consumption should be monitored when new food
is offered because rats may be suspicious of new food.
If assistance is not available, rats can be held in polythene restrainers
(can be made out of a plastic bag with end cut open for air).
RESTRAINT
 Most rats will allow you to pick them up by placing the 
hand firmly over the back and rib cage.
A rat can also be scooped up with both hands.
The head can be restrained with the thumb and
forefinger behind the jaws.
Scruffing the loose skin at the nape of the neck can help
restrain an active rat, but many rats object to this.
 Rats may bite aggressively if restrained against their will.

Egyptian Spiny Mice
(Acomys cahirinus cahirinus)
By Thomas Ryan, DVM, Dipl ABVP-Avian
Several captive mice species are referred to as spiny
mice, but the most common are Egyptian spiny mice.
The name "spiny" comes from the fact that the hair coat
is modified into coarse bristle-like spines, similar to
hedgehog spines, which are believed to serve as a
defense against predators
Free-ranging spiny mice are golden brown with a lighter-
colored underside and light patches underneath the eyes
 and behind the ears. Their spines can be black or tan.
ORIGIN
 Their native habitat includes the deserts and rocky
savannahs of Africa, the Middle East, India, Crete and
Oyprus where they live in cracked soil, rock crevices and
 gerbil burrows. They are generally nocturnal.

and should not be housed alone, although certain
individuals can be very territorial.
The enclosure must be secure to prevent escape.
 These are particularly active rodents that enjoy multi-level
enclosures, non-toxic branches and rocks for climbing.
 A metal hamster running wheel with solid fooring should
be provided.
Because they are excellent chewers, plastic products
should not be used in the enclosure. Wooden blocks and
leather chew toys are good for enrichment.
Hiding spaces (e.g., hide boxes) in the enclosure are
essential.

HOUSING
Gerbils are social animals and are best housed in pairs.
 Ensure adequate cage space to prevent fighting.
The minimum cage size should be 36 square inches per
 gerbil; a pair requires a minimum of 180 square inches.
The most popular housing for a pair of gerbils is a 10-
Vaginal orifice
 gallon aquarium, which may house 1-3 gerbils.
The enclosure should be escape-proof with a secure lid.
 Plexiglas enclosures designed for small rodents make
Anus
 adequate houses for gerbils.
Anus
 Regular weekly cleaning schedules must be maintained
because this solid-sided caging (as opposed to wire) will 
trap ammonia from urine.
 A split tank is an ideal way to introduce gerbils to each
other.
Solid flooring is preferable to wire flooring.
Bedding should be clean, dry, absorbent, nonabrasive
and at least 2 cm deep to facilitate nesting behavior.
Aspen wood shavings or recycled paper bedding products
are acceptable substrate materials.
 Natural sunlight is beneficial to all creatures, but gerbils
must not become overheated.
 An acceptable lighting schedule consists of 12-hour
alternating light and dark cycles.
Ideal environmental temperature is 60-70*F (16-21°C).
ldeal relative humidity should not exceed 30-50%
Common household dangers include chewing electrical
cords, children dropping or stepping on the gerbil, other
pets (cats/dogs/ferrets are natural predators), eating toxic
 substances, gnawing inappropriate items and escaping or
getting lost.

wooden blocks are good for this purpose
Exercise wheels and plastic exercise balls provide an
outlet for energy
Gerbils like to build nests out of nesting material,
especially in the winter months.
DIET
Commercial pellet diets are available for gerbils

DVB
RESTRAINT
Gerbils should be supported on the palm of the hand
while holding the tail base because they move very
quickly and tend to jump.
Avoid grasping the tip of the tail, because the skin may
deglove, necessitating amputation of the tail.
Additional restraint can be provided with an over-the-back

Chinchillas
Chinchillas are rodents, characterized by their large
hind feet, compact bodies, soft dense fur, large eyes
and ears, long whiskers, and bushy tails. Chinchilla
lanigera, with a longer tail, is the most common pet
 species, while Chinchila brevicaudata has a very
short tail. The chinchilla's natural environment is the
semi-arid rocky slopes of the Andes mountains in
South America.
PET APPEAL/BEHAVIOR
Affectionate, intelligent, charming personalities.
Bond quickly to their owners.
Hardy and suffer few illnesses.
Chinchillas can make great pets, because they are easy
to care for, have very little odor and rarely bite.
Dogs, cats and ferrets are predators.
 Basically nocturnal, they may be active during the day.

If a female chinchilla is not bred at a young age, its
pelvis will fuse and it may have difficulty giving birth later.
 An open vulva, often with visible mucus, is an external
indication of estrus.
HOUSING
House individually, in pairs or in a polygamous group with
a single male and 2-4 females
Cage should be at least 3 x 2 x 2 feet (90 x 60 x 60
cm), constructed from wood and mesh wire.

Temperatures higher than 82°F (28°℃) can be result in
heat stroke. Optimal temperature is 50-68*F (10-20°℃).
DIET
Commercial chinchilla pellets, water and unlimited
timothy hay provide an adequate diet.
Chinchillas can thrive on a mixture of grass (timothy.
brome, oat) and legume (alfalfa) hays.
 Adults require 1-2 Tos of pellets daily.
 Sugary treats, such as raisins or dried apples, and fatty
foods, such as sunflower seeds or peanuts, should be

A 20-gallon or larger size aquarium is acceptable.
The optimum environmental temperature is 75-85°F (24-

section of the enclosure.
Preferred bedding is newspaper or recycled pelleted/
absorbable material, which should be changed frequently
and kept dry. Cedar shavings should be avoided.
 Most hedgehogs prefer quiet, dim environments and may
react with fright at loud noises or bright sunlight.
Pastic and paper tubes provide
environmental enrichment for hedgehogs.
ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT
 Environmental enrichment should include a hiding place,
such as a cut-out box, plastic log or flower pot.
Hedgehogs will use an exercise wheel with a solid floor.
A pan or shallow tub with warm water in a warm ambient
temperature may be provided for swimming.
 For bathing. a mild pet shampoo safe for kittens or
ferrets is suitable. The hedgehog should be kept in a

DIET
 Free-ranging hedgehogs are insectivore/omnivores.
Captive diets should be relatively high in protein and low
in fat (see below for diet choices)
 Commercial complete hedgehog diets should be used if
available. Cat or dog foods alone do not seem to be
adequate as the sole diet component.
To introduce individuals to new diets, mix new foods
gradually into the old. It helps to have all pieces of the
new and old diets the same size and relative consistency.
To minimize obesity, ad lib feeding of adult hedgehogs
should be discouraged. Feed a portion size in the evening
that is almost completely consumed by morning. Only a
small amount of food should be given during the day.
Younger hedgies may eat an adult quantity, depending on
their stage of life and activity

Degus
The degu (Octodon degus) is native to the western
foothills of the Andes. Degus are rodents belonging to
the suborder Hystricognathi ("porcupine-like rodents")
based upon jaw musculature and skull structure. They
belong to the family Octodontidae. Octodon refers to
the "figure 8" shape of their cheek teeth. Other
names for the degu include brush-tailed rat and
trumpet-tailed rat.
PET POTENTIAL/BEHAVIOR
Social animals.
 Enjoy human attention.
Long-lived.
Have a low incidence of disease.
Degus are diurnal and do not hibernate.
 They are highly social and communicate via vocalizations 
and postures.
Degus are coprophagic.
 If degus are not given social interaction and physical
stimuli, they may become aggressive or self mutilate.
 Fghting is rare even when new introductions occur.
They dig elaborate burrows.

Skunks
Eeven different species of skunks belong to the
Mephitidae family. The striped skunk, Mephitis
mephitis, is the species most commonly kept as a
 companion animal in the US. Free-ranging skunks are
well recognized for spraying a foul-smelling secretion 
from their scent glands as a defense mechanism, but
captive-bred pet skunks are typically descented at a
young age. State and local authorities may have
specific regulations, licensing requirements or even
prohibitions regarding skunk ownership. Go to

requirements.

Skunks should be neutered prior to 6 months of age to
reduce aggression and prevent complications secondary
to extended estrus in females.
HOUSING
Minimum cage size should be 36 x 24 x 24 inches (90 x
60 x 60 cm) per skunk.
 An indoor adult pet skunk does not need to be confined
to an enclosure.
Young skunks may need to be confined when
unsupervised, and their enclosure should be spacious,
sturdy and durable to prevent escape.
A sleeping quarter den allows the skunk to feel secure.
The den may consist of a cardboard box or large plastic
shelter, such as a dog carrier, and should contain cloth
blankets, sheets or other bedding material that can be
removed and washed frequently.
Skunks may be destructive; they climb and open
cabinets, dig at carpeting and steal objects, so their
environment should be modified accordingly.
The home environment must be "skunk-proofed" by
installing child-proof locks on cabinets, securing vents
through which the skunk could escape, removing potted
plants, poisons, chemicals, electrical cords and fragile or
expensive household items from the animal's reach.
Skunks should be provided with a place and opportunity

Fennec Foxes
The fennec foxes (Vulpes zerda) are in the Order
Carnivora, the family Canidae and the genus Wulpes
(with the red fox, Arctic fox and 9 other species).
Fennecs are found in the Sahara desert region of
North Africa from Morocco and Niger to Egypt and
Sudan. Fennec foxes are listed in Appendix Il of CITES
and are considered threatened in the wild.
PET POTENTIAL/BEHAVIOR
Clean, have no odor and are relatively easy to care for.
Engaging. social animals.
Fennecs may require several hours of play time/exercise
with the owner and are not considered a "lap pet.'
Fennecs are fastidious.
Fennecs live in colonies of up to10 individuals.
When approached by someone, a fennec will normally
cower, lay on its side, yelp, and wag its tail in a typical
canine greeting display.
When fennecs are content, purring may be observed.
They can be taught to fetch, which can be a means of
providing exercise.

QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE
Fennec Foxes
MALE
FEMALE
 The pads of the feet are covered with fur, protecting them
from heat and enabling the fennec to run in loose sand.
Fennecs have exceedingly large tympanic bullae,
emphasizing their dependence on hearing for predation.
 The fennec radiates body heat by dilating blood vessels in
its feet and its large, vascular ears.
 The tapetum lucidum is well developed and the pupil is
elliptical and vertically slit. Both characteristics are typical
of nocturmal predators that hunt on a horizontal plane.
Compared with other vulpines, the canines of fennec
foxes are smaller, and their teeth are sharply cuspidate.
SEXING AND REPRODUCTION
Fennecs are easy to sex; they have reproductive anatomy
typical of canines.
 Fennecs are unusual among wild canids in that the
female is seasonally polyestrous.
Breeding pairs are monogamous and will peacefully
coexist year round.
 Males urine-mark their territory during breeding season.
Fennecs become very nervous and aggressive during
breeding and rearing.
 To prevent neonatal deaths, disturbances should be
 avoided until the kits reach 3-4 weeks of age.
 In practice, kits are sometimes pulled at 10-12 days and
hand-raised on a fox milk replacer such as Day One?
Formula 35/32 (www.foxvalleynutrition.com).
For hand-raised kits, solid food may be introduced at about
1 month, and weaning may occur as early as 6 weeks.

Fennec Foxes
HOUSING
A ferret enclosure with shelves makes a suitable cage.
Fennecs should be kenneled while unsupervised
Fennec foxes can easily climb out of fenced enclosures;
therefore, the enclosure should be designed so the
occupants cannot dig out or otherwise escape.
Dusty cage substrates should be avoided.
The enclosure should be placed in a low humidity, well-
ventilated environment.
 Free-ranging fennecs practice site-specific defecation
and, therefore, can be litter box trained.
Because of their digging habits, a covered litter box is
recommended. Regular clay litter is preferable
Fennecs can be leash- or harness-trained but can easily
escape from either if startled; a crate is preferable.
basking in the sun.
Fennec foxes will shiver when the ambient temperature
drops below 689F (20°℃)
DIET
The diet of free-ranging fennecs includes plant material,
fruits, small rodents (gerbils, jerboas), birds, eggs, lizards
and insects (locusts). Plant roots are a source of water.
 In captivity, the staple diet should be a completely
formulated diet, such as high-quality dog or cat food.
Mazuri Exotic Canine Diet? (www.mazuri.com) is widely
used for this species.

many New World monkeys require 70-80% humidity.
A squeeze back cage is desirable, and an owner should
be encouraged to have at least a small squeeze cage to
use as a hospital cage in an emergency situation.
 A transfer box with a guillotine-type door, rather than the
conventional kennel carrier for dogs, is recommended.
Environmental enrichment facilitates adequate exercise

 Deciduous forests, closed canopy gallery forests, arid
 bush/forest; an atypical mountain population has also
been described
SUITABILITY AS PETS
 Generally unsuitable; should be kept only by experienced
persons who have sufficient time and knowledge to care
for them appropriately.
 As for other primates, it is challenging to meet physical
 and behavioral needs in the captive setting.
 Ring-tailed lemurs are extremely active and can be
destructive. They need spacious enclosures.
Their highly social nature means that they are best
housed in pairs or preferably a small group.
While they have many endearing traits when young, as
they become sexually mature, pet lemurs tend to develop
owners. This frequently results in abandonment.
PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS
Gray-brown to rosy-brown back and rump; lighter limbs
 and belly; extremities white; top of head, rings about eyes

and nommal behavior.
Digits end in pads; nails rather than claws (except for the
2nd toe which has a grooming claw)
 The lower incisors and canines protrude forward, forming
a "comb" that is used for grooming.
 Males have a horny spur on each wrist that they use to
pierce tree branches before scent-marking them.
BEHAVIOR
 Diurnal
Largely arboreal but do spend approximately one-third of
their time on the ground.
Highly social and vocal with distinct dominance
hierarchies within groups; social bonds are established
and reinforced by grooming.
Adult females are dominant over males
 Basking and huddling behavior is related to energy
conservation (prosimians have a lower metabolic rate
compared to other primates).
Olfactory communication is important; facilitated via
scent gands on wrists and chest; secretions may be
rubbed on the tail and ficked at an opponent
The tail and facial expressions are used to communicate.

 Adult males maintain separate territories and may fight
another male for control of its territory. Generally, 1 male
 will mate with all females in an area
 Bushbabies may become aggressive as they reach sexual
 maturity; this is a significant danger due to their fierce bite 
and potential transmission of zoonotic diseases.
 Bushbabies are arboreal, found in thick vegetation and 
nesting in trees or in hollow logs during the day.
 They are nocturnal and have excellent night vision and an
acute sense of hearing.
 Vocalizations include a clicking sound to call, a loud cry or
bark for distant communication and territorial encounters

 In captivity, the lack of an appropriate social environment
coupled with a lack of environmental stimulation can lead
to stereotypical and maladaptive behaviors (e.g.
regurgitation/reingestion, self-mutilation, coprophagia).
CAPTIVE HOUSING
 Regulatory bodies dictate minimum space requirements
for captive primates as 2.5 times the height and 5 times
the width of the animal with arms extended. Other
sources recommend a minimum cage size of 5 x 5 x 7 ft
(1.5 x 1.5 x 2.1 m).

 Mwo perches per animal should be provided; each should
be long enough to allow the animal to recline.
 Nests should also be provided for each animal (adults
rarely share nests).
"Furniture" (e.g., climbing ropes, chains, branches)
should be added to encourage play and exploration.
Bushbabies will adapt quickly to a reverse day-night cycle;
a red fluorescent or red flood light can be used during the
day, and a bright white light used as a total light source
during the night hours, without altering activity patterns.

CLASSIFICATIONS
There are no specifc subspecies or breeds of llamas.
Some breed distinctions are made in South America as
either heavy-neck fiber (chaku, lanuda, tapada) or short-
neck fiber (cara, pelada). Otherwise, classifcation of
llamas is based on fiber length (appearance, weaver's
interest), conformation, temperament or color.
ORIGIN / FREE-RANGING HABITAT
Thellama and other camelids (camels,alpacas,

 The native habitat is scrub brush and grasses along
plateaus from sea level up to 13,123 ft (4,000 m).
BEHAVIOR
Phillips
 Lamas are very social animals that tend to make other
non-predatory animals and humans part of the "pack."
 Because of their tendency to be protective of other animals
besides their own species, llamas are commonly used as

The bottom incisors protrude rostrally, while the single
upper incisor is positioned caudally and has the
appearance and function of a canine tooth.
 The dental formula for deciduous teeth is 2 x (l 1/3,

 Typically 1 male is housed with 6 females, which is
referred to as a harem.
 The length of gestation is 335-360 days.
Cias (baby camelids) usually weigh 18-45 Ib (8-20 kg).

 A fence system needs to be set up and maintained so
 An owner should consider predatory prevention as well.
Even though llamas are used for flock protection, they
can still be a victim of predation, both human and animal.
DIET
 Lamas may be maintained on a grass pasture or receive 
good quality grass or mixed grass and legume hay.
 They consume 1.0-1.5% body weight in roughage daily.
If there are no excessive energydemands,such as
 pregnancy or lactation, they do not need to receive
concentrates.
 Uamas are prone to obesity and choking.
 Providing a salt-mineral mix and supplemental vitamin E
(15-60 IU of dl-α tocopherol acetate/kg of dry matter fed)
is recommended.
 Consulting with a local or state agricultural extension
service is recommended in order to determine the
appropriate supplements for a particular area
Lamas do not have the capacity to lick; therefore, salt 
blocks are unwarranted.
- An ample fresh water must be available at all times.

may infict serious injury to their handlers.
Manual restraint is the most common means of subduing
llamas. The best technique is to use at least a minimum
of 2 people whose objective is to work the animal into a
corner of a small pen.
 If possible, clients should be advised to build a small

 Halters may be made from ropes or purchased. Lamas
typically do not like their head or face touched and may
rear their head and neck in different directions, possibly
injuring the handler. Also, a spit rag may be placed over
the muzzle if indicated.
During restraint, the llama may communicate displeasure 
 and possibly biting. The ears held back and the tail held
in a vertical position indicate aggression, as does a snort 
(short burst of air through the lips).
 Screaming is common when the animal is frightened.
 Cowkicking can also occur during restraint as does
spitting of stomach contents. Prior to being spewed on, a

ANESTHESIA
Local anesthesia is used following standard guidelines for
other species. Regional blocks are not typically done due
to lack of detailed information for llamas
Epidural anesthesia is commonly used for procedures
involving the perineum.
 Injectable and inhalation anesthetics are commonly used.
The references contain information specific to doses
routes of administration, intubation techniques and
 precautionary statements regarding usage.
BLOOD COLLECTION
 Venipuncture may be accomplished at the jugular vein,
cephalic vein (cranial aspect of the radius), ear vein,
ventral midline tail vein or lateral saphenous vein.
 The jugular vein is difficult to identify because of the
depth in the neck, lack of a jugular furrow, thick skin and
hair. It is best to pursue this vessel low on the neck in the
area of the thoracic inlet. The vein lies medial to the
ventral projection of the transverse process of the cervical
vertebrae. The vein may also be approached high on the
neck adjacent to the ramus of the mandible.
 One should avoid clipping the hair because it may take up
to 1y2 years to grow back.

ZOONOTIC POTENTIAL
There are several organisms to which llamas are
susceptible that pose health concerns for humans.
 Among the viruses, rabies virus is paramount.
 Contagious ecthyma, a parapox virus, is known to cause
severe ulcerative skin lesions in man.
 Fungal infections resulting from dermatophytes, such as
Trichophyton verucosum, T. mentagrophytes and
Microsporum spp., have also been responsible for causing
skin disease in humans.
Bacterial diseases, such as tuberculosis (vycobacterum

Experimentally llamas are susceptible to B. abortus.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
 Lamas may require shearing in hot and/or humid climates
to prevent heat prostration/heat stroke.
 Hand-raised or over-handled/over-socialized parent-raised
cras may become aggressive to humans and infict severe

Barns are a necessity in cold climates. Barn size should
be large enough to provide at least 15-20 ft2 (1.3-1.8

 The barn floor substrate may be dirt, wood, cement or
clay. Clay is the preferred substrate. It is generally placed
over gravel and packed down. It absorbs moisture and
wicks it to the gravel below. It keeps hooves trimmed and
is easy to sweep out and replace as needed.
 Regardless of the region, shelter should be available to
protect the animals from wind, rain and snow.
 Fresh water should be available at all times. In colder

RESTRAINT
 Goats should be approached in a quiet and non-
threatening manner. They remember bad experiences,
making follow-up encounters more difficult.
 Goats should not be restrained by their ears or caught by
grabbing a hind limb, which can lead to hip dislocation.
Recommended methods of restraint involve grabbing the
beard, horns, collar or halter. An arm may be wrapped
around a goat's neck.
 An assistant may steady a goat against a wall or straddle
them and back into a corner. Chutes may also be used.

Endotracheal intubation is recommended, especially if the
animal has not been fasted.
 The trachea is manually palpated prior to induction to
estimate the size of the tube. The animal should be
placed in sternal recumbency. A technician should extend
the head and neck, keeping them parallel to the table or
 ground, while opening the mouth with gauze loops.
 The oral cavity is narrow and the base of the tongue is
thick, which narrows visibility.
 A laryngoscope with an elongated blade will facilitate
placement of the tube or guide tube by depressing the
base of the tongue. A canine urethral catheter that is
smaller and longer than the endotracheal tube may be
used as a guide device, allowing for the sliding of the

It is advisable to thoroughly research any anesthetics prior
to use, as goats are sensitive to certain drugs.
 Positioning of the head (if possible), where the throat is
elevated with relation to the mouth and the thorax, will

Care should be taken when administering vaccines due to
vaccine site reactions. Many goats are used for show or 
meat, and blemishes can lead to disqualification or
condemning of a carcass.
The recommended route and site for administration of
vaccine is subcutaneously in the caudolateral neck or
behind the elbow. Avoid the prescapular lymph node area
(point of the shoulder), as a vaccine reaction may be
confused with caseous lymphadenitis.

BREEDS/ PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES
 The most common breed kept as a pet in the United States
is the Vietnamese potbellied pig.
Vietnamese potbellied pigs have a short nose, sway back,
pot belly, small upright ears and a straight tail.
 The coat color was originally black, but varieties of black
and white or red coats now exist.
 Pet pigs with long snouts, long legs and/or curly tails may 
be a result of mixing feral or commercial swine with
Vietnamese potbellied pigs.
LAWS AND PERMITS
Many cities, counties and municipalities do not allow pet
 pigs within their boundaries.
 Laws that restrict the keeping of livestock within city limits
are often applied to miniature pet pigs as well 
 Pet potbellied pigs are livestock and transportation is
regulated by strict rules that may differ from state to state.
 Most states require a health certificate that has been signed
 by an accredited veterinarian, and/or an entry permit.
VITAL STATISTICS
Many states require that the pigs be tested for pseudo-

An insulated house for sleeping and nesting
is necessary if the pig is housed outdoors
 The pig that is well socialized and trained from an early age
 is a better pet for the family.
 Miniature pigs are foraging animals that spend much of
their day either in search of food or resting.
When kept as a pet and fed 2-3 small meals daily, the pig
 may spend as little as 20 minutes a day eating.

Aggression toward people is a common problem in the pet
pig and may occur when the pig is not given enough
enrichment or is not properly trained or socialized.
 Pet pigs may be taught some tricks to keep them mentally
stimulated.

 Pigs are usually quiet but will scream when frightened,
firmly restrained or when begging for food.
 It is normal for pigs to foam and froth at the mouth when
they are excited about food
 Unpredictable behavior, aggression, urination in the house
or destructive nest-building can occur with estrus
 It is recommended that the pig be spayed at 3-6 months.
CAPTIVE HOUSING AND MANAGEMENT
 A minimum pen size of 8 x 15 feet (2.5 x 4.5 m) per pig is
recommended (larger is desirable for exploration/activity).
An insulated house with 6 ft2 (2 m2) per pig for sleeping
and nesting is necessary if the pig is housed outdoors.
 The house should be clean, dry, sanitary and draf free.

Indoor pigs should be confined to a pig-safe room when
unsupervised
 All house pigs should be allowed outdoor exercise time.
!
Pigs that spend time outdoors are more likely to have
healthy coats and hooves.
 Outdoor enclosures need at least 1 foot (30 cm) of the
mesh fence below ground, as pigs may attempt to dig
under the fencing.
 Bedding must be dry and deep enough to allw for rooting
or for an animal to completely cover itself.
 Old blankets, comforters, sleeping bags, hay, straw or
hardwood shavings are acceptable (cedar avoided).
Wet or dirty bedding should be cleaned daily.
An indoor rooting box requires an accessible entry
TEMPERATURE
The ideal environment range is 60-759F (15-24°C) with a
humidity of 50%.
 Pigs do not have the ability to sweat. Supplemental cooling
(e.g., shade, fans and water for wallowing) is necessary
when the outside temperature exceeds 859F (30oC).
 A mud wallow is acceptable provided it is not used as the
 defecation area by the pigs.
 Pigs have sensitive skin that can sunburn.

 Foraging is a natural behavior for miniature pigs
and should be encouraged.
 Pans must be large enough for the pig to turn around
 A shallow child's pool with an entry way cut out can be used
as long as it is fastened down to prevent being turned over.
 The litter pan should be placed at the opposite end of the

DIET
Pigs are omnivorous, foraging animals.
 Pet pigs should be fed diets formulated especially for
 miniature pigs that do not require supplementation.

 growth in a relatively short time period and should not be
fed to pet pigs. Feeds for miniature pigs are lower in 
protein and fat and higher in fber.
A pig fed a diet too high in fat and protein (e.g., dog or cat
food) can exceed its genetic potential and achieve a larger
frame size as well as storing an extraordinary amount of fat.
 Feeds are often classifed as starter grower, breeder or
maintenance, or alternately as youth, active adult and elder.
 Maintenance rations contain approximately 12% protein,
2% fat and 12-15% fber and should be given to pigs
 after about 8 weeks of age.
 Food and water bowls should be fastened to the ground
so the pig cannot climb in or tip them over.

WATER
 Food and water should be placed in an easy to clean

 A pig may be restrained by corralling it rather than holding
it tight, using as little restraint as possible.
The pig should be anesthetized for anything other than
routine exams.
 A pig should not be picked up or restrained by the legs.
 Potbellied pigs are more prone to lower back and leg
injuries than commercial swine.
A small to medium-sized pig may be scooped up with one
hand under the rump and the other hand placed in front of
the forelimbs and under the neck.
A lift table must be used for larger pigs.
 While a pig is on the exam table, contact with it must be 
maintained at all times.
A pig may be kept calm by offering frequent treats or by
 scratching/petting its neck, sides or abdomen while it is 
being examined or vaccinated.
 Snout snares are not recommended for pet pigs.
Pig slings (www.panepinto.com) may help examinations.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

 Internal parasites: They do not share parasites with dogs or
cats. The swine ascarid (Ascaris suum) is the most
common intestinal parasite and is most likely to be present
in a pig under 1 year of age. It is a potential human health
hazard. Stomach worms (Hyostrongyius), threadworms
(Strongyloides ransomi), nodular worms (Oesophago-
stomum), whipworms (frchuris suis), lungworms
(Metastrongyfus) and coccidia (lsospora suis) also are
found. Ascarids, stomach worms, nodular worms.
threadworms and lungworms should be treated with

External parasites:
· Clinical signs of scabies (Sarcoptes scabier), which 
include severe pruritus, erythema and thickened crusty
skin, are most noticeable on the forelegs, ears and
trunk. Deep skin scrapings allow diagnosis. Scabies can
be treated with ivermectin (300 mcg/kg SC; repeat in
10-14 days). Subclinical sarcoptic mange occurs in large
goups of swine.
·Haematopinus suis is a large sucking louse, readily
seen with the naked eye. Lice are easily treated with
ivermectin injections, administered at 18-day intervals
or insecticidal powders, dips or sprays applied at 7-14
day intervals.

Chinese water deer have specialized canine
teeth that are used for self-defense
BEHAVIOR
Deer are social animals. Female deer (does or hinds) and
fawns (neonates and juveniles) are frequently found in
groups, and it is not unusual for male deer (bucks or
stags) to run together during the non-breeding season.
Hand-raised cervids accept humans as "part of the herd."
Bottle-fed deer are very affectionate with their owners.
This may result in dangerous situations once the animals
mature, particularly with bucks during rut
Even females and castrated males have been known to
attack their owners with little or no provocation.
 Deer commonly bite and head butt their conspecifics as
part of their social interaction, and they are not afraid to

(post-shed or castrated) males will strike with their
forefeet, while supporting their weight on their rear limbs.
 Usually, sexual segregation occurs, and hierarchy revolves 
around size or age. Males out-rank females.
 All deer have well-developed scent glands located
craniomedial to the eyes and between the toes
Alarm barking occurs when a threat is perceived.
HOUSING AND MANAGEMENT
Free-ranging deer live in variety of environments, including
deserts, mountains, grasslands, forests and tundra.
The natural environment should be mimicked in captivity to
reduce the stress and subsequently the risk of disease
(horses, donkeys, pigs, barnyard fowl).

 Guidelines for enclosure size from the Minimum Standards
for Wildlife Rehabilitation: 1-2 neonatal fawns may be
housed in an area 4 x 4 x 4 ft (1.2 x 1.2 x 1.2 m): older
but pre-weaned fawns (n = 4): 10 x 15 x 6 ft (3 x 4.5 x
1.8 m); and juvenile and adult deer (n = 6): 30 x 50 x 6 ft
(9.1 x15.2 x 1.8 m).
 Deer are capable of jumping great heights; an average-
sized deer is capable of clearing a 7-ft (2.1-m) fence. In
gereral, it is best to have a fence height of 10-12 ft (3-3.6
Chainlink is probably the most common fence material
used. High tensile wire and electric fencing are alternatives.
 Close spacing of the stay wires prevents entanglement and
injury.
 A visual barrier, such as shade cloth attached to the fence,
will help prevent a deer's attempt to go through the fence.
 Nontoxic thorny bushes that grow well on fences can serve 
as attractive biological barriers.
 Dauble barriers will prevent close contact with free-ranging
deer, thus reducing the potential spread diseases.
Cement footers or recessed rebar may be used to prevent

DIET
Deer may be offered food once to twice daily based on
their physiological needs and weight.
 Deer ruminate. Chewing and re-chewing their cud
faclitates digestion and maintenance of a healthy pH in
the gut by continually mixing bicarbonate-rich saliva with
the food.
 The types and quantities of foods consumed reflect the
free-ranging environment as well as seasonality, sex and
reproductive status.
 Deer are generally categorized into 3 groups of feeders:
concentrate, bulk and intermediate feeders.
 Concentrate feeders are typically small animals with a long.
face and narrow incisor arcade. The rumen is small, and
the other 3 chambers are not well-defined. Therefore, they

 Supplementation of hay or pasture is dependent on the
the animals.
 A good rule of thumb for the amount of hay to feed is
approximately 14 flake per animal.
 The clinician should examine the hay and pellets that their
cient is feeding and make recommendations regarding
proper storage to prevent mold and pest infestation. Hay
should be dry and smell fresh. The pellet size should be
appropriate for the animals' mouth size. Choke can develop
rapidly and ultimately be fatal if the pellets are too large.
 Clean water should be provided as well as a balanced salt
mix or block commonly used for domestic hoof stock.
 If deer are raised on pasture or given forage that is
deficient in copper, they may be supplemented with 100
mg/adult animal/day of copper sulfate or 0.09 mg/kg/day of
Bood collection may be obtained from the lateral saphenous vein (arrow)

BLOOD COLLECTION
 Blood may be collected from the jugular, cephalic, lateral
and medial saphenous veins (proximal to hock joint).
 The animal may need to be sedated or anesthetized
depending on its demeanor.
 The veins are easy to observe with minimal pressure, but
the use of topically applied isopropyl alcohol or shaving
may be required.

Deer do not like to be manually restrained
They have a high flight drive when frightened, which
 prevents performing physical examinations and procedures
that are routine in other species.

Anesthesia on exotic ruminants carries increased risk of
morbidity and mortality.
 It is highly advisable to gain experience by working with or
observing experienced veterinarians, zoo staff or wildlife
agents if possible. Familiarity with the most common
anesthetics and remote delivery systems (pressurized gas-
powered rifles, pistols, blow pipes and darts) is
imperative.

 Before initiating any procedure, the veterinarian should
discuss the risks of anesthesia and consider having signed
release documentation by the owner.
 The owner should be advised to administer vitamin E orally
(200 IU/kg of dry matter fed/day) 1 week prior to any
elective procedure. Vitamin E aids in the prevention of
capture myopathy.
Proper monitoring (i.e., temperature, pulse, respiration,
blood pressure, pulse oximetry) is the key to prevention of
complications.

males should not.
Coatimundis may damage property or sustain injury from
household hazards if allowed free roam of the house.
ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT
Enclosure should contain branches and hollow logs large
enough for climbing.
RESTRAINT
Coatis are difficult to manually restrain; attempt restraint
only for injection of medications and anesthesia.
Wooden “houses,hammocks or
 ledges should be provided for sleeping.
Heavy leather gloves, towels, blankets and catch nets
may be necessary.
ANESTHESIA
Inhalation anesthesia is recommended.
If the coati can be restrained, general anesthesia should
be given with a non-rebreathing circuit and a face mask.
Induction involves exposure to sevoflurane in a large cat
induction chamber; coatis often recover quickly.
Anesthetic via IM injection is not recommended by the
author.

leash, and play games like fetch.
 Coatis are often taken as pets when they are young and
cute, but as these animals reach sexual maturity they
may become unmanageable.
Coatis are unpredictable, capable of inficting injury and
may carry zoonotic diseases.
 They should not be recommended as pets.
BEHAVIOR

Genetta is an Old world genus, inhabiting most of Africa
and western Europe.
 Genets inhabit forests, savannahs and grasslands with a
maximum average home range of 3 square miles (7.8 km2).
PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS
Genets are long-bodied, short-legged carnivores with
pointed snouts and large rounded ears.
 They have a dense hair coat of variable coloration (gray to
yellow with rows of brown or black spots) and a very long
banded tail. Melanistic individuals are not uncommon.

 Humidity recommendations depend on the species. A
wide humidity range is tolerated, desert species prefer
-30% humidity, while aquatic species prefer --60%.
DIET
Genets are classified as carnivores but are actually more
 omnivorous in the wild. The diet varies according to
availability and typically includes rodents, birds/eggs,
reptiles, amphibians, insects and fruits.
 In captivity, diets should consist of ground meat supple-
 mented with vitamins and minerals (e.g., Nebraska

MOST COMMON DISORDERS
 Most medical problems of domestic canids and felids apply
to genets.
 Infectious diseases reported include canine distemper,
feline panleukopenia and rabies. In Africa, genets are
thought to be a wildlife reservoir for the rabies virus.
Other diseases reported in wild genets include bovine
tuberculosis, lymphocytic choriomeningitis associated with
the ingestion of rodents and ebola hemorrhagic fever.
Parasitic diseases in genets are similar to other domestic
carnivores and include roundworms, Physaloptera, Oxyuris,
Dirofiflaria repens, tapeworms, hookworms, whipworms,
fleas, ticks and mites. Control and treatment is as used for
domestic dogs and cats

A concrete floor is necessary outdoors to prevent escape.
 At least 2 litter pans of appropriate size need to be
 provided and cleaned daily.
A water area (i.e., small pool for wading) is recommended.
 Many pet servals are housed indoors similarly to domestic 
house cats.
A den area for sleeping should be provided.
Pet servals should be acclimated to carriers for transport to
veterinary hospitals in case of emergency.
QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE
Servals
Compared to other exotic felines, servals require minimal
special care and canbehoused outdoors evenin colder
climates, provided that a warm nest box is available.
ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT
In captivity, scratching, chewing and biting may become a
problem, so items appropriate for these activities should
be provided to curb these behaviors.
Hollow logs, pools, scratching posts, climbing areas and
 shelves are all appropriate.
Appropriately-sized toys may be used.
DIET
 Free-ranging diet consists of various small prey primarily
rodents, and also birds, reptiles (especially frogs), fish
and insects.
In captivity, some servals will readily eat commercial
carnivore diets (e.g., Mazuri Exotic Felinee or ZuPreem
 Exotic Feline Diet) or may eat one of a variety of raw
food or whole food diets
 Some servals have been successfully maintained on high
quality commercial pet cat food diets.
 The diet must be animal protein-based and nutritionally
complete and balanced. The calcium to phosphorus ratio
is very important (Ca:Phos = 1-1.5:1).
Raw food and whole food diets need to be obtained from
reputable sources to assure quality.
RESTRAINT/ANESTHESIA
Adult servals may be difficult to restrain and handle
without sedation.
QUICK REFER ENCE GUIDE

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
The serval is listed in CITES Appendix 2 (not currently
threatened with extinction but may become so unless
trade is closely controlled).
 Cwnership of a serval may require a permit, depending
on the locale, and may be illegal in some areas.
Pet serval owners must also check for insurance and
liability issues.
 Because the serval is not a domestic cat, rabies vaccines
may be unrecognized by health officials in cases of
human exposure consult local regulatory authorities.
 Heartworm, intestinal parasite preventives and flea and
tick control, as for domestic cats, are recommended.
 There are varied opinions on spay/neutering and
 declawing of pet servals, but generally these are
recommended for household pets.

A young ocelot at Alameda Park
Zoo in Alamogordo, New Mexico.
Stereotypic pacing may be seen in enclosures with
design problems, e.g., where a dead end is present.
Sub-adults up to 2 years old may be accepted within
adult ranges; thereafter they are strongly territorial and
usually solitary (only meeting to mate).
CAPTIVE HOUSING
A minimum area of 25 m? (270 ft) per animal is
required with 2-3 times this space for breeding. The
enclosure needs to be quiet and secluded for breeding.
Ocelots are highly arboreal, and the enclosure should be
>2.4 m (8 ft) high with trees/poles for exercise
Housing must prevent escape by climbing. leaping or
swimming across barriers. The perimeter should be
checked frequently for points of weakness. Entrances
should be double-gated to reduce risk of escape.
 Natural substrates with some flexibility (e.g., marine

a good hide box for an ocelot.
plywood or strong plastic) are preferable to concrete.
 Pest control is needed, e.g., to prevent feral cats
 Ocelots should be protected from temperature extremes.
ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT
A complex environment should be provided, with various
levels and surfaces, vegetation and elevated platforms.
Hiding places provide areas of security (e.g., shrubbery).
A hide box with straw or hay bedding should be provided.
Novel objects will stimulate explorative behavior, e.g.
sticks, rawhide chews, cardboard boxes, lavender, cut
leafybranches or paper bags.
 Juveniles will hunt invertebrates attracted by rotting logs
or rocks.

Ocelots
 Hunting behavior may be stimulated by varying food and

Operant conditioning may be used to stimulate animals
and assist in management procedures.
DIET
 Ocelots are carnivorous; natural prey species include
 small mammals, reptiles and birds.
The captive diet may be whole carcasses (e.g., rats,
mice, rabbits, chicks, pigeons, quail and pheasants), a
commercial meat-based complete diet (e.g.: Dallas
Crown Inc., www.dallascrown.com) or kibble (e.g., Mazuri

 Feline spongiform encephalopathy has been reported in
an ocelot, and many countries recommend not to feed
certain bovine material (e.g., brain) to felids.
RESTRAINT
Small individuals (<10 kg. 22 Ib) may be netted for short
procedures, e.g., injections.
A squeeze cage is useful for larger animals, or darting
equipment may be used to administer drugs for chemical
immobilization.
ANESTHESIA

to reduce the risk of emesis and aspiration during
induction and recovery
Anesthetic protocols are similar to aggressive domestic
cats, e.g., ketamine +/- benzodiazepine or α2-agonist
(the latter may be reversed with atipamezole).
Intravenous propofol can be used to top-off anesthesia.
 Oxygen supplementation should be provided and
intubation performed where possible. Gas agents (i .e.,
isoflurane, sevoflurane) are used to prolong anesthesia.
MOST COMMON DISORDERS
Nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism/metabolic
bone disease (>1% dietary calcium is necessary to
prevent deficiencies)
 Dental disease
Osteoarthritis and pad ulceration
(especially on concrete substrate)
Trauma (e.g., digits caught in small mesh)
Obesity
 Gastrointestinal foreign bodies
Infectious agents (as for domestic cats): viral (e.g
mhinotracheitis, calicivirus), bacterial (e.g., Heficobacter),
fungal (e.g., dermatophytosis), parasites (e.g., ascarids,
heartworm, fleas and ticks)
VACCINES
Risk assessment should be performed by a veterinarian.
Extralabel use of felid vaccines is possible, but it is
advisable to use killed virus vaccines, e.g., Fel-o-vax
feline vaccines (Fort Dodge Laboratories Inc.,
ww.wyeth.com/divisions/fort_dodge.asp) and IiMRAB

rabies vaccine (Merial, www.merial.com). Boosters are
gven only after antibody titers have been ascertained.
ZOONOTIC POTENTIAL
 Similar to domestic cats, e.g., rabies, dermatophytosis,
toxoplasmosis, ascaridiasis.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Surgical neutering (i.e., castration or ovariohysterectomy)
is recommended in preference to chemical contraception
for animals not intended for breeding.
 Endoparasite control is based on regular fecal screening.
 Most medications, including ecto- and endoparasite
control, are used as for domestic cats.
A permit may be required to keep an ocelot in captivity.
The AB blood group system in cats requires donor and
recipient to be cross-matched before transfusions or
blood products are administered.

ORIGIN / FREE-RANGING HABITAT
 Capybaras are native to South America
 Capybaras reside in areas from rainforests to flooded
savannahs, where there is access to a constant source of
standing water, as they are semi-aquatic in nature.

PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS
Capybaras are the largest rodents.
 The coat is coarse and thin, with reddish brown coloration
Capybarashave no tail
 Their back legs are taller than the front. Four digits are pre-
sent on the forelegs and 3 on the rear legs, with connect-
 ing skin between them as an adaptation for swimming.
 Capybaras have an extremely efficient digestive system.
The caecum is exceptionally well-developed where active
fermentation occurs, producing volatile fatty acids.
SEXING AND REPRODUCTION
 There is no obvious sexual dimorphism (a pouch of
cutaneous skin folds covers the genitals).
 Males have a larger sebaceous scent gland that forms a

 The family Soricidae is distributed worldwide, except in
Australia and NewZealand.The genus Sorexincludes
common shrews of North America and Europe.
The S. araneus is a terrestrial species and is commonly
found in grasslands, woodlands and creek banks.
SUITABILITY AS PETS
Shrews are very prone to stress and therefore could be
recommended as pets only for very experienced owners.
In many countries this species is protected by law.
PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS
A shrew is characterized by its long flexible nose, small
eyes, short legs and very dense dark brown velvety fur,.

They make small sleeping nests (burrows) of moss, dried
leaves and grass or use the burrows of small rodents.
Their olfactory and hearing senses are well developed.
Shrews produce ultrasound, which is used as a primitive
form of echolocation.
Shrews do not hibernate.
CAPTIVE HOUSING
This species can be housed in pairs.
 The substrate should consist of earth, peat and turf sods.
Nest boxes are filled with hay, moss and/or cotton wool.
Dried leaves, cardboard boxes,hay and grass may be
provided as part of environmental enrichment.
ENVIRONMENTAL TEMPERATURE/HUMIDITY
The preferred ambient temperature is 15-23°℃ (58-73°F).

RESTRAINT/ANESTHESIA
 When handling a shrew, the goal is to minimize the risk
of being bitten. Towels or soft leather may be used.
Inhalant anesthesia (isoflurane) is recommended. An
anesthetic chamber or premedication with injectable
anesthetics (e.g., medetomidine, midazolam, ketamine)
is used for induction.
MOST COMMON DISORDERS
Shrews suffer from skin diseases (i.e., trichophytosis)
Intestinal parasitism (Staphylocystis sp., Moifuscotaenia
 sp., Longistriata sp.) is very common.
ZOONOTIC POTENTIAL
Shrews are reservoirs of many zoonotic parasitic (Crypto-
sporidium sp.), mycotic (1. mentagrophytes), bacterial
(Bartonella sp, Borelia sp., Leptospira sp.) and viral
(tick-borme encephalitis,hantavirus) infections.

very curious animals.
Very little territoriality is evident in free-ranging cavies,
but males appear to have a moderate dominance
hierarchy.
 Like all rodents, they reach sexual maturity quickly.
PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS
 The general body form of a Patagonian cavy is that of a
long-legged rodent with a body similar to a hoofed
animal.
 The haircoat, while stiff and dense, should have a very
fine texture.
The front feet have 4 toes while the back feet have 3.
All toes have a sharp claw.

MOST COMMON DISORDERS
 Dental malocclusion occurs in Patagonian cavies for

including genetic structural abnormalities (brachygna-
thism), inappropriate wear as a result of diets lacking in
dietary fiber, and injuries, such as broken incisors. The
 approach to managing dental disease is the same as
with guinea pigs.
 The long stature of the leg bones can predispose to limb
fractures, especially in the tibia.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS AND CAUTIONS
 If frightened, Patagonian cavies will try to escape.
 Patagonians have reported sprint speeds up to 35 mph
(45 km/hour) for distances of more than half a mile
(1000 m). Their speed and jumping ability may
predispose them to injury.
 While generally non-aggressive, the sharp claws are
capable of causing deep scratches.

ORIGIN / FREE-RANGING HABITAT
Naked mole rats are endemic to arid regions of
northeastern Africa (Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya).
 These rodents live in low-oxygen, high-carbon dioxide
 subterranean burrows
SUITABILITYASPETS
 They could be recommended only for very experienced 
owners because of their social life (large colonies) and
specific husbandry requirements, including very large
tanks.
PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS
Naked mole rats are adapted to their typical burrowing
lifestyle. Their body is cylindrical with the back arched
dorsally over the lumbosacral region.
 The limbs are short and slender. The head is cone-shaped
with prominent jaw musculature. Their eyes are tiny, and
external pinnae are missing. Loose skin is brownish-pink

African Naked Mole Rats
BEHAVIOR
Naked mole rats are eusocial mammals that live in
colonies typically comprised of 60-80 individuals.
 Each colony generally includes one breeding female
(queen) and 1-3 breeding males. Only this female in a
colony produces offspring. Other females within the
colony are not sterile but are simply sociologically
suppressed by the dominant queen.
Other smaller males and females are the primary
maintenance workers and foragers, and larger individuals
defend the colony against predators and foreign rats
Living entirely underground, naked mole rats excavate an
extensive system of tunnels with their continuously
growing incisors.
 The majority of the burrow is composed of several nests
 and many foraging tunnels, constructed in search of an 
underground food.
Free-ranging animals are active 24 hours a day.
CAPTIVE HOUSING
Naked mole rats can be maintained in a large aquarium.
 If long plastic tubes that mimic tunnels and plastic boxes

conduction.
The preferred body/ambient temperature is 28-33°℃
(82.4-91.4°F).
Humidity level should be kept at 30-50% with good air
ventilation.
DIET
 These rodents are primarily herbivorous and eat a low-
quality and high-fiber diet (roots and tubers), which also
serves as their source of water and minerals.
Coprophagy contributes to the high digestive efficiency.
 In captivity they will readily consume sweet potatoes,
various vegetables (carrots, corn and broccoli), ground 
rodent pellets, tubers and fruits (apple, peach, banana
and pear}
RESTRAINT
When handling, the goal is to minimize the risk of being
bitten.
Towels, soft leather or gloves may be used for restraint.
ANESTHESIA
 Inhalant isoflurane anesthesia is recommended.
 Premedication with injectable anesthetics is used for
induction. Dosages used by the author include:
medetomidine (0.05-0.12 mg/kg), midazolam (0.1-0.3
mg/kg) and ketamine (3-10 mg/kg)
Premedication with butorphanol (0.3-0.6 mg/kg IM) and
then placement in an anesthetic chamber is possible.

MOST COMMON DISORDERS

infections, which can kill an entire colony.
 This species is susceptible to incisor overgrow, especially
after an incisor fracture.
 Mole rats that are seriously injured should be housed

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
It is suggested that this species uses a mechanism
independent of vitamin Dg in regulating mineral
homeostasis and therefore is well adapted to an
environment without sunlight.
 Intestinal calcium transport in mole rats is independent 
of vitamin D mediation, and no dietary vitamin D or
calcium is therefore provided.

Sugar Gliders
Gliders can be safely restrained by placing a thumb
under the jaw and an index finger on top of the head.
RESTRAINT
 Manual restraint is best accomplished using either a
surgical huck towel or feece bonding pouch as a glove.
 These animals should not be scruffed or held by the tail.
 Sugar gliders can be transported to the clinic in a zippered,
fleece pouch.
BLOOD COLLECTION
Only small volumes of blood may safely be drawn, up to a
 maximum of 1% of the animal's body weight in grams.
 A 1-ml tuberculin (or 0.5-ml insulin) syringe, with a 25- to
 29-gauge needle, is recommended for most diagnostic

FORMULARY FOR SUGAR GLIDERS
Although every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the information presented herein (particularly doses), in all cases the clinician is
pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted; therefore, the clinician must critically evaluate the information provided and stay informed of
recommendations in the literature.
Dosages listed in this formulary are anecdotal as reported in the literature except where noted. Sugar gliders have carnivore/omnivore
gastrointestinal tracts; therefore, carnivore guidelines should be followed for antibiotic choice. Pain resulting from an injection can cause the
rapid induction of shock in small species of marsupials.s1s
Compounding note: Due to sugar gliders' overwheiming predilection for sweets, most sugar gliders respond favorabiy to medications that are
compounded with a fruity favor. TLutti-fruity typically works best, although other frurit favors, such as apple, peach have aiso been Lsed with favor-

Virginia Opossums
The Virginia opossum (Dideiphis virginiana) is the only
native marsupial of North America. (New World

'possums" are "possums"). Some states and
municipalities prohibit ownership of native or wildlife
species, and local or state regulatory agencies should
be consulted for information on proper permits. The
private practitioner interested in working with virginia
opossums is referred to the National Opossum Society
(NOS),www.opossum.org.

must be encouraged to exercise.
 Pet opossums should be spayed or neutered.
 Male castration is performed by incising at the base of
the scrotal "stalk," ligating vasculature and suturing skin
with a subcuticular absorbable suture.
 Excess scrotal tissue may need to be ablated with
castration.
 In males, neutering decreases scent marking and odor.
 In females, spaying decreases the likelihood of chronic
urogenital tract infections.

but care must be taken to separate the ureters that loop
between the central and lateral vaginas.

Adults may fight if the quarters are too small.
 Large groups may be housed in yards measuring 100
feet x 150 feet.
Standard caging for rabbits with a solid foor may be used.
Appropriate bedding includes recycled newspaper that
has been shredded or pelleted.
A nest box 12" x 18" x 16" (30 x 45 x 40 cm) should be
provided and can be attached to the outside of the cage.
 Environmental temperature ranges of 50-86°F (10-30°℃)
are acceptable, with 72°F (22°℃) being ideal
 The environmental humidity should be greater than 58%.
 The cage must be kept clean and dry to prevent foot
problems.

RESTRAINT
Control can be maintained by using a cat restraint bag or

The tail is positioned
 for blood collection.
BLOOD COLLECTION
The lateral tail vein may be accessed for blood collection
in younger animals without scarred tails.
 There are also ventral veins on either side of the
coccygeal artery.
 A 20- to 22-gauge needle without a syringe should be
inserted blindly into the ventral aspect of the tail and the
blood allowed to fow.
Pressure must be applied for several minutes to prevent
hematoma formation.
 The cephalic and a tibial (saphenous) vein can also be
accessed.
 Pouch veins can be used in the female

Ring-tailed Possums
 Free-ranging ring-tailed possums may build as many as 5
nests (dreys) in tree hollows and dense undergrowth and
move often; they sleep in them during the day.
Vocalizations include a soft, high-pitched, twittering call.
Though generally not overly aggressive, they are territorial
Occasionally, some animals will become extremely
aggressive and attack intruders within their territory.
Caution should be used when entering the aviary.
CAPTIVE HOUSING
 They require a large, aviary-type enclosure, preferably
highly toxic to possums) and small trees
 An outdoor aviary is best because ring-tailed possums
mark their territory, which can be rather pungent.

ANESTHESIA
Gas anesthesia is the anesthetic of choice;however,
intubation is difficult and requires an endoscope or a

Animals that are not accustomed to handling may benefit
 from a mild sedative administered IM prior to gas:
midazolam (0.1-0.2 mg/kg) or medetomidine (0.03-0.05
mg/kg), butorphanol (0.2-0.4 mg/kg) would be safe and
effective; buprenorphine (0.03 mg/kg) can also be used.

BEHAVIOR
 Corn snakes are a good beginner snake because they are
 non-venomous, generally calm and docile, easy to handle 
and care for and thrive in captivity.
 They are most active at dawn, dusk and during the night.
 They are solitary animals so they are best housed alone.
CAPTIVE HOUSING
 A corn snake should be housed in at least a 20-gallon tank
with a secure top, as they are known to be escape artists.
Aspen or cypress shavings are often used as substrate to
newspaper, reptile carpet or paper towels.
 Hiding places are necessary, as corn snakes become
stressed if they cannot hide.
 Branches should be available for climbing and resting.

Ball Pythons
The ball python (Python regius), or royal python, is an
attractive and gentle snake native to western and
west-central Africa. These nocturnal pythons prefer
mixed grassland and trees (savannah) as their habitat.
When they are frightened they coil up into a ball;
pythons are considered a threatened species.
PET POTENTIAL/BEHAVIOR

Ball pythons are notorious for not eating and may go for
extended periods (sometimes over a year) without eating.
 Health problems may occur secondary to chronic anorexia.

SEXING
Ball pythons are difficult to sex visually, but are easy to
sex via a probe.
The males have thicker tails, and the anal spurs are
longer and more curved.
Females have a probe depth of 2-4 subcaudal scales and
males have hemipenes with a probe depth of 6-10
subcaudal scales.
HOUSING
 Standard aquariums work well as enclosures.
Ideal Size:
· Hatchling: 10 gal tank (20" x 10" [50 x 25 cm])
·Adult: 20-30 gal tank (36" x 12" [90 x 31 cm]}
Snakes must be able to stretch out in an environment
that encourages exercise.
The cage should have a screen top for adequate
ventilation. Tops should be secure and escape proof.
 Sliding doors should be secure and raised on a plinth to
prevent waste accumulation.
A dark hiding box is mandatory for a sense of security
 and a place to rest during daylight hours.
 The lids of glass and plastic vivaria must be at least 50%

Cypress mulch may be used as a substrate for adults but 
must be kept free of moisture and fecal/urinary
contamination and changed frequently.
Some ball pythons will not eat unless they are able to
burrow.
 Ball pythons do not require sources of Uv light in their
enclosure because they are nocturnal and obtain vitamin
D, in their diet.
A climbing branch or two should be provided. Artificial
greenery adds a nice touch as well as a sense of visual
security for the snake.
TEMPERATURE
Ambient air temperature should be provided throughout
the enclosure.
Proper temperature regulation is the most important
aspect in maintaining a healthy snake.
The enclosure must be kept between 80-85°F (26-29°C)
during the day, with a basking area kept at 90-949F (32-
34°C). At night, the air temperature should not fall below
75°F (24°℃).
Room temperature is not adequate for the digestive
process and health of the snake.
 Heating may be provided by special reptile heating pads 
or tape or with overhead ceramic heaters in porcelain
reflector hoods, screened off or placed to avoid direct
contact with the snake. Thermostat control is ideal
 A barrier should be provided between the snake and any
heating elements or hot surfaces.
QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE
Frozen mice are available
Ball Pythons
in many pet shops.
Two thermometers are needed for the cage: one 1" (2.5
cm} above the floor in the general enclosure area and
another near the basking site.
The use of "hot rocks" in the snake's enclosure is a
leading cause of thermal burns and should be avoided.
HUMIDITY
Proper humidity levels help to ensure successful sheds.
 The ideal humidity of the enclosure is between 60-80%.
 An alternative is to provide a shedding box (e.g..
Tupperware container with moistened sphagnum moss or
terry cloth towels and the two opposite corners cut out for
entry and exit). The snake can be trained to use this box
for shedding. A box with moistened sphagnum moss may
also serve as an egg-laying site.
Fresh water must be provided at all times in a water bowl
that is large enough for the snake to soak in. The water
should be changed when soiled.
DIET
Ball pythons are fed at night.
Young snakes (2-3 years of age and 18-36 inches long)
should be fed every 7-10 days; older snakes should be
fed every 2-3 weeks
 A prey item appropriate to the size of the snake should be
fed at each meal.

Gerbils are the initial prey of choice, although dark-
colored mice or hamsters might work as prey in a
reluctant eater.
Some snakes do not recognize red-eyed white mice as a
food item.
 Rubbing mice with a gerbil can impart the scent of the
 gerbil to the mouse and aid in converting the snake to a
mouse diet.
Frozen mice are available in many pet shops.
 As the snake gets larger, small rats are ideal.

PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS
 Blood pythons are squat, heavy-bodied serpents with
varied markings.
 Coloration may vary from yellow, tan and brown to a bright
red, cherry red or oxblood with lighter tan, gold, orange
 and black blotched markings.
 The head is typically gray, although specimens may exhibit 
black, light gray or even red heads.

Python curtusbrongersmai
SEXING AND REPRODUCTION
 Sexual determination by probe depth is 9 subcaudal
scales for males and 3-4 for females.
 Sexual maturity is 18 months to 4 years.
 Breeding size occurs at lengths of 3-5 feet (0.9-1.5 m).
 Wild-caught females may not breed at all in captivity.
 Breeding season in captivity typically ranges from
November to March. All feeding should be stopped at this
time. Animals should be well established and in excellent
condition before breeding is attempted.
 Breeding may be induced by reducing daytime
photoperiod to 8-10 hours and dropping nighttime
temperatures to around 75°F (24°℃). The female should
be introduced into the male's cage. Misting the animals
with water may also induce breeding activity.
 Females shed 14-20+ days after ovulation; eggs are
typically laid within 30 days of post-ovulation shed.
 Clutch size varies from 8-20 eggs.
 At an optimal incubation temperature of 88-90°F (31-32
C%), these eggs take an average of 60 days to hatch.

make it difficult to maintain humidity levels
 Feces/urates/uneaten prey items must be removed from
the enclosure as soon as possible.
 Depending on cage conditions, all substrate and cage
furniture should be removed and the enclosure completely
disinfected using a 5% bleach solution approximately
every 30 days. The enclosure must be rinsed thoroughly
and allowed to dry before cage furniture and snake are
replaced.
 Newspaper is the easiest and least expensive substrate
material for cleaning and disinfecting. Cypress mulch
holds humidity but excess humidity should be avoided. Do
not use substrate containing cedar.
 Bood pythons are sensitive snakes that appreciate and
utilize a hide spot, so at least two should be provided.
Clay flowerpots, plastic flowerpot trays and commercially
available hide boxes all work well.
Because blood pythons are nocturnal, supplemental
lighting is not necessary. However, if it is used it should
run on a 12/12 cycle. Continuous bright, overhead
lighting is stressful.

ENVIRONMENTAL TEMPERATURE / HUMIDITY
Basking spot should be 88-89°F (31°C): ambient
(background) temperature range is 78-82°F (25-27°℃):
minimum ambient temperature is 75°F (24°℃)
 If the ambient temperature is strictly maintained around

box, water bowl and substrate.
 Under-cage heating pads, ceramic heat emitters, basking 
bulbs (both regular daytime and red "night" bulbs) are
possible heating accessories.
 Thermostats, rheostats and/or timers must be used to
 control the heat source
 Hot rocks should not be used in order to avoid serious
burn.
 Heat emitters and bulbs, especially if combined with a
screen top, will dry the air in the enclosure quickly, s0
additional humidity is needed.
To provide a snake with a humidity level of 50-60%:
· Use cypress mulch or a similar mold-resistant substrate
that can be misted. It is advantageous if the substrate
changes color when it is wet, thereby providing visual
 cue for the next dampening. Using cypress mulch
requires disciplined maintenance, as a dirty and humid
enclosure will quickly lead to unhealthy conditions.
·A "humidity box" may be constructed for the snake by
packing a plastic container with damp sphagnum moss
(think well-wrung-out wash cloth to gauge moisture)
with a hole cut in the top or side. Screen top on the
enclosure needs keeping moisture from escaping. It is

Blood Pythons
important to maintain a proper, reliable ambient
temperature, as warm air holds more moisture than
cool air.
WATER
 Fresh, clean water must always be available, as blood
pythons have a tendency to drink copiously.
 A water dish should be large enough for the python to 
crawl into and soak. Ensure that the bowl is not too deep
for juvenile animals-—approximately 1 inch (2.54 cm) of
water will suffice.
Because snakes often defecate in their water bowls,
regular changing. cleaning and disinfection are necessary.
DIET
 Primary diet is live rodents (young gerbils, mice) and birds
(chickens). A live rodent should not be left unattended
with any snake.
 Blood pythons are generally easy to convert to frozen/
thawed or pre-killed rodents.
- Bood pythons should be fed with an appropriately-sized

 integration every 2-3 meals.
Blood pythons can eat rats starting off with rat "crawlers"
for younger snakes (every 5 days) and moving up in size
as the animal grows.
Sub-adult and adult pythons are prone to obesity due to a
strong feeding response coupled with a slow metabolism,

Green tree pythons may be difficult to remove from a
resting perch and may become agitated orinjured with
forceful removal. Easily removable perches facilitate

the enclosure in a single motion.
ANESTHESIA
 Prior to anesthesia: evaluate vital parameters for baseline
(heart rate, respiratory rate); assess fuid, nutritional and 
thermal status; perform preanesthetic blood profile
(PCV /total solids easily performed in-house), if possible.
Premedications ease induction and are likely to provide
analgesic properties: butorphanol (1-4 mg/kg IiM) or
buprenorphine (0.005-0.01 mg/kg IM).
 Premedication is recommended 20-30 minutes prior to
induction.
Induce with inhalant agent: isofurane (5%) + oxygen via
face mask or induction chamber.
Alternatively, induce with injectable: propofol (3-5 mg/kg
Iv) in ventral tail vein.
Maintenance of inhalation anesthesia using a precision
vaporizer allows for better control of anesthetic depth:
isoflurane/oxygen via uncuffed endotracheal tube;
nonrebreathing system (02 flow rate 300-500
ml/kg/min); intermittent positive pressure ventilation
(IPPv): 4-6 breaths per minute; manual or mechanical

 With the exception of lids to prevent escape and
individual housing, milk snakes require quite simple
conditions in captivity.
The size of the terrarium should be proportionate to the
length of the snake; while hatchlings can be housed in a
40 L (10.5 gal) capacity terrarium, adults should have a
120 L (32 gal) capacity enclosure.
 As substrate, it is possible to use paper towels (the
simplest and most hygienic option), Astroturf carpets,
clean and dried sand, untinted aspen shavings (cedar
and redwood are toxic) or sterile potting soil. Substrate
should be changed every 6 months.

Earthworms and small lizards may also be offered.
 Usually there is no need to supplement the snake's diet
with calcium or vitamins because they ingest whole prey.
Nevertheless, it is a good idea to offer an adequate diet
to prey animals or gut-load them.
 The water bowl should be changed daily.
RESTRAINT
 Milk snakes are usually quite docile and don't mind being
handled, although some individuals may defecate when
manipulated.
As with all snakes, the head should be grasped with one
hand to prevent biting, while the other hand supports the
rest of the body.

ORIGIN
Bearded dragons are native to central Australia.
FREE-RANGING HABITAT
They are semi-arboreal and live in a range of habitats
from desert to dry forests and scrublands
PET APPEAL
 In the wild, they spend the mornings and afternoons
foraging and the hottest part of the day in underground
burrows. They are well adapted to cool desert nights.
 Bearded dragons usually thrive in captivity.
BEHAVIOR
In most cases they are calm and rarely bite, scratch or
whip with their tails.
They usually do not exhibit signs of stress from handling.
and they may feed from the hand of their caretakers.
 They make good pets, even for children, due to their
docile and social nature.

Bearded Dragons
The housing environment should include
thick branches and rocks for climbing.
 Breeders often house 2 males and 3 or more females
together for the breeding season. Having more than 1
male present can stimulate male reproductive activity.
Hatchlings should be maintained separately from adults.
If multiple individuals are housed together, their body
conditions should be monitored closely. Signs of stress
include low body weight and poor condition. Dominance
problems are not uncommon.
 Hungry juveniles housed together can bite off the toes 
and tail-tips of their cage mates.
 An enclosure for 1-2 adult bearded dragons should be at
least 2 x 4 feet (61 x 122 cm) in size, be easy to clean
and have smooth sides to prevent rostral abrasions.
 A 10-gallon aquarium is suitable only as short term
housing for juveniles.
 Acceptable substrates include soil, newspaper, alfalfa
Large rocks should be provided for a

basking site for bearded dragons.
Cat litter, com cob, walnut shell and wood shavings are
not suitable substrates
Care should be taken to avoid placing food items directly
onto substrates that can cause impactions if ingested
Care should also be taken to ensure proper hydration if a
substrate is used that results in lowered cage humidity.
e.g., sand or newspaper.
Burrows/hiding areas should be kept slightly more humid
than the rest of the enclosure. This can be accomplished
by using substrate that retains moisture, such as cypress
mulch, or by using a wood shelter and periodically
soaking it in water.

 Ways to successfully keep bearded dragons from
becoming dehydrated while eliminating the need for
water in the enclosure include: providing a shallow pan
for soaking 1-2 times weekly as needed, ensuring
increased humidity in a shelter/hiding area,and rinsing

Beardie basking below Uv bulb.
Active Iv Heat" (wwww.t-rexproducts.com), should be
positioned out of reach of the lizard with no gass or
plastic between the bulb and the reptile.
Fuorescent Uv lights should be placed within 18-20
inches (45-50 cm) and mercury vapor bulbs should be
somewhat beyond that distance.
 Fuorescent bulbs should be changed every 6 months for
juvenile lizards and yearly for adults. The mercury vapor
bulbs should be changed at least yearly.
 Bearded dragons thrive in a well-ventilated, low humidity
environment
A daytime temperature gradient, from 80°F (27°℃) on the
cool side of the vivarium to 90-95°F (32-35°C) at a
basking site, should be maintained.
Nighttime temperatures can drop to 70oF (21°C)

ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT
Bearded dragons are most active during the day and are
adept climbers.
 In addition to providing the basking site and shelter/
hiding area, the housing environment should include
thick branches or rocks for climbing.
Bearded dragons should not be allowed free roam of the
house in order to prevent chilling, trauma, escape,
ingestion of foreign materials, such as potentially toxic
live plants, and the risk of spreading Salmoneffa

diet.
 As they mature, the intake of greens increases as does
the size of insect prey.
Hatchlings
Hatchlings should be fed daily with small insects, such as
crickets, phoenix worms, mealworms or other nontoxic
collected grasshoppers, grubs, flies and moths.
Greens and some vegetables should be provided daily.
Insects cultivated for feeding (e.g., crickets and

several days. Changes in husbandry and routine soaking
should be initiated when this problem occurs.
 Intestinal impactions can occur from ingestion of sand,

Old World Chameleons
Free-ranging Old world chameleons (Chamaeleonidae)
live in Africa, southern Europe, the Near East, Middle
East, Sri Lanka and India. Over 150 species and 180
subspecies of chameleons have been described;
about half of these are located on Madagascar. All Old
World chameleon species are classified as threatened
(Level Il CITES). The most commonly kept species are
veiled chameleons (Chamaeleo calyptratus),panther
chameleons (Furcifer pardalis) and Jackson's
chameleons (Chamaeleo [Trioceros] jacksonii).
PET POTENTIAL
They are appealing as pets because of theirunique
appearance and biological characteristics.
Meller's chameleons (Chamaeleo [Trioceros] mefler) are
not recommended for beginners due to high mortality

Juveniles are light brown and turn bright green at maturity
(4-5monthsofage)
BEHAVIOR
Jackson's chameleons are less territorially aggressive
than most chameleons but tend to live singly in the wild.
Female gives birth to live offspring (8-30 young) after 5-6
 months' gestation.
CAPTIVE HOUSING
 Mature males should not be housed together, and most
prefer to be solitary in the wild.
 Enclosures should be as large and tall as possible and
made with screen sides for optimal ventilation (plastic-
coated screening or PvC mesh is recommended over
Mlale chameleons fighting
metal screening).
Glass aquariums arenot unacceptable enclosures as they
do not provide ventilation, have a tendency to collect
mold and are generally not large enough.
Jackson's chameleons generally will not drink from bowls
but capture water droplets from leaves.
 Newspaper or soil can be used as substrate.
 They are generally believed to benefit from UvA and UVB
light exposure during daylight hours.
ENVIRONMENTAL TEMPERATURE/HUMIDITY
Daytime temperature: 75-78°F (25°C) with basking area
Humidity 50-80%
QUICK REFER ENCE GUIDE
Jackson's Chameleons
 Humidity should be maintained with an in-cage rain, drip
or automatic misting system as manual misting may not
provide enough moisture for adult chameleons. Adults
run the risk of developing kidney failure from chronic low-
level dehydration from inadequate misting.
 All misting systems must be kept very clean. Monthly
disinfection with bleach is recommended (dilution of 1
part bleach to 32 parts water) for at least 15-20 minutes
with a thorough rinsing.
ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT
 Sturdy climbing branches and ample hiding places must
be provided.
Live plants (i.e., pothos, ficus, hibiscus, scheflera) help
maintain humidity and provide climbing/hiding places.
DIET
Free-ranging chameleons eat hundreds of species of
insects and invertebrates (i.e., snails and spiders). Some
chameleons may also eat flowers, leaves and fruit.
 A variety of small soft-bodied insects (e.g., crickets, flies,
butterflies, mealworms, waxworms, superworms) should
be offered.
All prey should be dusted with calcium powder.
 Keeping the chameleon well-hydrated by providing
drinking water in an appropriate misting system is very
important.
 Feed adults every other day; juveniles daily.
RESTRAINT
Support body weight, and do not restrain using tail.

the deserts and dry rocky plains of Afghanistan,
India and Pakistan. Leopard geckos are now well
established in captivity following decades
of large-scale commercial propagation.
PET POTENTIAL/BEHAVIOR
Gentle lizards.
Hardy, long-lived.
Easy maintenance.
Moderate size, attractive appearance.
Nocturnal.
ANATOMY
Unlike many other geckos, leopard geckos possess
movable eyelids
Leopard geckos lack the adhesive lamellae on their feet
that enable many other geckos to cling to glass or walls.
Instead, on each digit is a small claw, suiting them well 
to a terrestrial lifestyle.

recommended for a group of 2-3 animals.
The cage should have a screen top for adequate
ventilation.
Acceptable substrates include paper towels, newspaper,

choice for a substrate
Leopard geckos feed primarily on live moving insect prey.
Commercial diets are available, including dried or canned
insects and frozen prepared meats.
Leopard geckos need to be conditioned to feed on non-
living food sources, and some may be hesitant.
An appropriate diet may consist of commercially-raised
crickets with smaller numbers of silkworms, roaches,
mealworms (Tenebrio sp.), superworms (Zophobas sp.).
waxworms and other live insects
Large leopard geckos will also consume baby “"pinkie" mice
and other lizards, but these food items are not required.

 Commercial reptile bedding, carpet, newspaper or paper 
towels can be used as substrate. Sand should be
 avoided as it may be ingested and cause impaction.
: An appropriate light cycle with a little over 12 hours of
"daylight" must be provided. Seasonal changes in the
length of daylight may be offered, especially if a breeding
program is planned.
 Fat-tailed geckos need a hide box shelter; because they
are nocturnal, they need to retreat from bright lights.
 Fat-tails do not require a cage mate, but up to 5 females
can be housed in the same cage as 1 male.
 Males should not be housed together because they will
fight with the possibility of serious injury or death.
Michele Buono, DVM
ENVIRONMENTAL TEMPERATURE/HUMIDITY
 The daytime temperature gradient should be 29-32°℃
(85-90°F) but can drop to 24-27°℃ (75-80°F) at night.
 Under-tank heating is preferred, although a heat lamp (a
nocturnal bulb works well) can be used. Uv lighting does
not appear to be necessary.
Humidity should be quite high (over 50%) and
maintained by misting the enclosure several times a
week and providing a shallow water dish at all times. A
humidity retreat is also a good idea (e.g., a small
container with damp spaghum moss inside).
 Hides, logs, cork bark pieces, rocks, and plants should
be provided.
QUICK REFER ENCE GUIDE
African Fat-tailed Geckos
DIET
Fat-tailed geckos may be fed primarily crickets and
mealworms, although adults may be offered the
occasional superworm or waxworm. Pinkie mice may also
be provided once a month.
Prey should be gut-loaded prior to feeding and dusted
with a mineral/vitamin supplement containing calcium.
Adults are fed every 2-3 days; juveniles every 1-2 days.
 The gecko can be fed all it will eat within 15 minutes (or
approximately 3-5 crickets). Uneaten crickets should be
removed, as they may stress the animal
Drinkingwater should be available ina shallow dish
RESTRAINT
Gentle restraint is recommended during an examination,
and the whole body must be supported in a hand.
Excessive pressure on the tail must be avoided.
ANESTHESIA
 A fat-tailed gecko may be placed in a small plastic bag
with 5% isoflurane or sevoflorane for 20-30 minutes and
tailled gecko to exteriorly elevate the throat with a finger
to better view and stabilize the trachea.
An injectable protocol for a small lizard has been
reported but has not been used by the author: ketamine

 Shedding problems (related to low humidity and the
absence ofa humid hidebox; the retained shed is usually
associated with extremities, such as the toes and the
tail, which may lead to constrictions, necrosis and loss of
toes or a portion of the tail. Shed retained around the
eyelids may contribute to conjunctivitis.)
Female reproductive disorders (very common and often
related to a husbandry error, such as absence of a
suitable nesting place).
Metabolic bone disease (MBD - it is necessary to feed
invertebrates a high quality, balanced diet with a calcium
 and vitamin D supplement to improve the calcium-to-
phosphorus ratio of dietary intake. Clinically, MBD in fat-
tailed geckos is expressed as swelling and soft mandi-
bular and maxillary bones and fractures or abnormal
anatomy of long bones).

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
The fat-tailed gecko is equipped with the natural defense
of being able to lose its tail when attacked by a predator.
 The tail is also where it stores fat, an important energy
reserve. The gecko should not be handled by the tail.

BEHAVIOR
Diurmal activity
Males are territorial and may displaywith head bobbing
and colorful throat fanning.
Anoles are agile active lizards, climbing plants and
chasing prey during the spring and summer but are
generally less active in the autumn and winter.
Anoles periodically shed their skin as snakes and other
lizards do.
 Their tails will detach with mild force/restraint; although
the missing tail will regenerate, it will not look or function

CAPTIVE HOUSING
Tropical vivarium set-up is best.
Minimum size recommendation: 36 x 24 x 12 inches (90 x
60 x30 cm)
Enclosures should be made with screen sides for optimal
ventilation (plastic-coated screening or PvC mesh is
recommended over metal screening).
Glass aquariums are not unacceptable enclosures as they
do not provide ventilation, have a tendency to collect
mold and are generally not large enough.

 plants is the best enclosure.
Substrate will vary depending on whether or not live
plants or artificial plants are used to create the vivarium,
but care must be taken to remove areas of mold growth
 or decaying organic material.
 Commercial reptile bedding, various mulches, terrarium 
soils can all be used in the viviarium.
Sand and gravel are not recommended.
ENVIRONMENTAL TEMPERATURE/HUMIDITY
Daytime temperature range is 74-86°F (23-30°℃).
Night temperatures can drop to 68°F (20°℃).
Adequate humidity is essential (60-70%)
 Mist spraying daily usually provides adequate humidity.

 While not considered a beginning lizard due to the large
size and temperament of some species, tegus can be 
rewarding to keep when properly cared for.
PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS
Tegus are similar in build to monitor lizards.
Males have much larger heads and jowls as well as an
enlarged, thickened scale on either side of the vent.
Their bodies have unique, smooth scaling.

Colombian tegus are known to be the most aggressive.
while the other species tend to be more tame and easier
to handle.
 All species can display aggressive feeding behavior.
 It is not recommended to house males together as fighting
may occur.
Many tegus will slow down and even hibernate in the
winter months.
CAPTIVE HOUSING

Colombian black and white
tegu or gold tegu (T teguxin)
 Adults should be housed in a custom-built enclosure that
is 6 x 3 x 2 ft (1.8 x 0.9 x 0.6 m): height is less 
significant.
 Cypress mulch or similar is ideal for substrate so the tegu
 can burrow and humidity can be maintained (avoid corn
cob, gravel and small wood chips due to ingestion risk).
Fresh water should be available at all times, preferably in
a container large enough for soaking.
A hiding place should be provided on each end of the 
temperature gradient, and the mulch in the hide should
be kept slightly damp.

Hides and logs for climbing provide enrichment and aid in
shedding.
Tegus can be ofered feeder insects, which may provide
some exercise and enrichment, although larger animals
may not be interested in such small food items.
DIET
Tegus are carnivorous, although some species will also
accept fruit (e.g., strawberries, melon, tomatoes,
banana) in small amounts.
Juvenile animals should be offered feeder insects (e.g.
Juvenile tegus
crickets, cockroaches, supenworms, mealworms) and,

 Adult animals should be fed appropriately-sized feeder
rodents.
variety is important; many tegus will accept fish (tilapia,
catfish), cooked eggs, supplemented ground turkey and
feeder chicks
Feeding live rodents is not recommended due to the risk
of injury to the tegu.
Feeding in a separate enclosure is often recommended

RESTRAINT
With docile individuals, minimal restraint with one hand
on the neck and shoulders and the other hand
supporting the pelvis and hind limbs may be all that is
needed.
 More aggressive animals may require towel restraint; the
handler must be cautious to avoid being bit, scratched
with claws or whipped with the tail.
 Some tegus may require chemical restraint in order for a
full physical exam to be performed.
ANESTHESIA
Baseline blood work is recommended before anesthesia,
if possible.
 Premedication: butorphanol (0.5-2.0 mg/kg IM) or
buprenorphine (0.005-0.020 mg/kg IM) 20-30 minutes

BEHAVIOR
Coruicia zebrata are generally nocturnal but will bask
during the day under heat sources or the sun.
 These skinks are shy by nature and often remain hidden
in shelter during the daytime hours.
 If hand-raised and handled frequently, they will often
tolerate handling and become unafraid of human activity.

if a new individual is introduced into an enclosure.
CAPTIVE HOUSING
 They do best housed individually in an enclosure
A captive enclosure should measure at least 4 ft (1.2 m)
long by 2 ft (0.6 m) wide by 4 ft (1.2 m) high.
Circulation of air is important for this species, so at least
2 sides of the enclosure should be partially screened.
The screening must be heavy enough to support the
skink and allow for free movement.
A low wattage heat source (50-75 watt depending on the
size of the enclosure) is necessary as is a mid-range full
spectrum light source
Substrate should be one that holds moisture and allows
for high humidity. Orchid bark or coconut coir makes a
good choice as a substrate.
A water bowl with 2-4 inches (5-10 cm) fresh water
should be available at all times.
ENVIRONMENTALTEMPERATURE/HUMIDITY
Daytime temperature should be 82-909F (27.7-32.2°℃)
 Nighttime temperature can drop to 70-75°F (21-24°℃).
Cage relative humidity should be approximately 70-75%.
QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE

ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT
Live, nontoxic plants help raise humidity, provide visual
barriers and may be consumed by the skinks.
Pothos, hibiscus, scheffelera and ficus trees or plants
make good choices and are all nontoxic if ingested.
 Branches of various diameters are necessary to provide 
climbing areas for the skinks.

Solomon Island Prehensile-tailed Skinks
RESTRAINT
Prehensile-tailed skinks are large, heavy-bodied animals.
Their bite can be quite painful and cause serious injury.
These skinks may have very sharp long claws with which
they may scratch and possibly cause infection. Keeping
nails short with a nail clipper or Dremel-type grinding
device helps to prevent injury and infection.
 Prehensile-tailed skinks should not be grasped or
restrained by their tail, as this may result in injury.
Skinks are best held in a soft towel or restrained with
heavy gloves to prevent injury to the handler. They should
be supported under the abdomen so they feel secure.
ANESTHESIA
Butorphanol (1.0-1.5 mg/kg SC, IiM) may be used to
premedicate the skink.
Propofol (5-10 mg/kg Iv) may be used for either

vein with a butterfly catheter produces best results
A tiletamine/zolazepam mixture (3-5 mg/kg SC, IM) may
be used for short surgical procedures or induction.
Prehensile-tailed skinks may be maintained on gas
(1-3%) or sevoflurane (4-6%). They may also be masked
down with either inhalant at a higher percentage flow.
The animal should be confirmed as fully sedated prior to
intubation to prevent a biting injury to the handler. A
mouth gag may be fashioned from a plastic hypodermic
needle sleeve cut at one end to the proper length.
 The surgical plane of anesthesia may be assessed by a
lack of righting response or palprebral reflex.

MOST COMMON DISORDERS
Metabolic bone disease (due to a lack of adequate
calcium in the diet and/or insufficient exposure to full
spectrum UVB light)
 Necrosis of dligits or tail tip secondary to a poor shed
(The dried retained skin on these body parts acts like a
tourniquet, cutting off blood supply to the affected area.
A gentle teasing of of the dead skin with a thumb
forceps post-shed will help prevent this from occurring.
The humidity must be increased to ensure a good shed.)
Bite wounds and secondary abscessation or infection
Internal and external parasites
Dystocia in gravid females (skinks are born live)
 Ingested shed skin (a normal occurrence)
Yolk sac infections in newborns
 Stomatitis
ZOONOTIC POTENTIAL
Saimonella and Campylobacter may be acquired via a
fecal/oral route from skinks. Hands must be washed after
handling and skinks must be kept away from human food.

SUBSPECIES
There are a number of subspecies of Varanus; exactly
how many is controversial. The white-throated monitor
was considered a subspecies of the savannah monitor
until 1989 when it was identified as a separate species.

 Savannah monitors live in tropical savannahs that
experience seasonal monsoons with periods of drought.

(Varanus exanthematicus)
PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS
Both the savannah and white-throated monitors are
typically brown, black and grey with paler spots.
The stocky savannah monitor is considered a medium-
sized monitor with a wide head and short neck and tail.
 Besides being smaller than white-throated monitors,
savannah monitors have larger osteoderms, and their
nostrils are located closer to the end of the snout.
The white-throated monitor is large and muscular with a
 domed head and strong, thick legs and tail. It has very
and the tail is somewhat prehensile.
BEHAVIOR
Monitors are considered to be intelligent reptiles.
 They can be quite aggressive when cornered or if another
White-throated monitor

monitor invades their territory;: they are especially
aggressive during the spring breeding season.
 Savannah monitors are active during the day and may
hide in their burrows if it gets too hot.
White-throated monitors are active during the day during
the wet season (January-February). During the dry season
(July-December), they fast due to the lack of prey.
CAPTIVE HOUSING
Adult monitors should be housed in a large, solidly built 
enclosure at a minimum size of 4 x 8 x 4 ft (L x w x H)
(1.3 x 2.6 x 1.3 m);: a room with vertical space is best.
The enclosure must be secure because monitors can
escape easily
 The floor may be wood, concrete or glass covered with
QUICK REFER ENCE GUIDE
Savannah and White-throated Monitor Lizards
Enclosures for monitors should include
pcks for cover and basking and rocks
 and branches for climbing.
An area of deep substrate for digging and burrowing must
be available; this may consist of soil, cypress mulch or
small grade (orchid) bark to reduce dust.
Monitors need a large shallow water pan for soaking: this
will need frequent cleaning as they may defecate in it.
Supplemental ultraviolet light (UvA/UvB) is recommended.
Enclosures should include rockfeatures orahide boxfor
cover and rocks and branches for climbing.
ENVIRONMENTALTEMPERATURE/HUMIDITY
The hot end of the cage should be 90-100°F (32-38°℃)
with a basking spot that exceeds 110°F (43°℃); the cool
end should be 75-809F (24-27°℃).
Humidity should be fairly high without being wet: 70-80%
with good ventilation is appropriate.
DIET

RESTRAINT
Monitors can bite and scratchbut are usually calm for
they can be restrained like an iguana, with the front legs
held back along the body and the rear legs along the tail.
The tail whip of white-throated monitors is the hardest of
any monitor, so it is best to restrain the tail.

ANESTHESIA
Anesthesia in monitors is similar to that of other reptiles,
e.g.: premedication with butorphanol, induction with
isoflurane or sevoflurane by chamber or mask and
maintenance with gas anesthesia via endotracheal tube.
 Reptiles should be housed in their optimal temperature 
zone during induction, anesthesia and recovery.
Preoperative blood work should be performed and Iv or
intraosseous fluids given during anesthesia
Intermittent positive pressure ventilation should be per-
formed 4-6 times/min at a pressure below 12 cm H,0.

PET POTENTIAL/BEHAVIOR
Nile monitors (Varanus niloticus) might present at a
reptile owners and unwitting amateurs.
Not suitable for pets; potentially dangerous.
Alert and intelligent.
Grow quickly from charmer to liability. Nile monitors will
grow 200-300 times birth weight (30 g to 9 kg).
Best kept in the hands of experienced, responsible and
dedicated keepers.
Females raised since hatching may be tame when kept in
large front-opening cages.
 In contrast, males generally display a much higher level
of responsiveness and curiosity, but tame less readily.
veterinarians may notice 3 types of defensive behaviors

SEXING
Sexing is difficult in juveniles.
 Males may evert their hemipenes during handling or
defecation.
HOUSING
Hatchlings can start off in tanks 3' (1 m) long with
secure screen tops.
After 6 months, they need enclosures of at least 4' x 2"
(1.2 x 0.6 m).
 Adults (2-3 years old) require an enclosure the size of a
small room, at least 12' x 4 (3.6 x 1.2 m) for monitors
under 48" in length and at least 15' X 5' (4.5 x 1.5 m)
for specimens exceeding 48" (120 cm).
Juvenile monitors should be provided with shelters into
which they can curl their entire body.
Adults should be offered as spacious an enclosure as
feasible that allows opportunities to climb and explore.
 Raised structures, such as thick logs or cork bark rounds,
are used as basking sites.
 Multiple basking sites will encourage the lizard to move
within an enclosure when seeking thermoregulation.
Monitors may choose to sleep in their shelter, on tree
branches or in their water container.
 Fat rocks should be placed alongside the water container
to wear down nails as the lizards enter and exit the water.
 To accommodate high levels of activity and digging, the 
best substrates are mixes of peatmoss-based potting soil,
ground fir bark and sand, with some coarser material
such as a fine grade ground limestone to help wear nails.
QUICK REFER ENCE GUIDE
Nile Monitors
For juveniles, overhead spotlights
are sufficient for basking.
This substrate allows the digits to remain in a normal
position rather than twist to the side, as found in large
monitors kept on solid flooring.
Newspaper should be used only with young animals
especially prior to worming: it fails to provide a proper
texture for adults.
 If tractable, monitors can be allowed to roam in a
"reptile-proofed" exercise room.
TEMPERATURE AND LIGHT
 Extra light and heat are required for monitors of all ages.
Lights should be turned on 12-14 hours a day.
 The temperature measured 6 inches under the basking
site should be 88-100°F (31-38°C), not to exceed
105°F(40°C)
 For thermoregulation, part of the habitat should be
5-10°F (3-6°C) c0oler
As for most amphibious monitors, the Nile's activity
temperature is relatively low, about 90°F (32°C).
For juveniles, overhead spotlights are sufficient for
basking
For monitors over 30" (75 cm) in length, a combination
of large reptile heat pads and at least 2 spotlights, or 1
spotlight and 1 infrared ceramic incandescent heat bulb
over one or more basking sites are needed. These may
be controlled by rheostats or thermostats
Aternatively, an area can be provided where Nile
monitors can bask in unfiltered sunlight (through a
welded wire screen-covered window or in an outdoor
plastic-coated welded wire cage during the summer).
Monitors may benefit from exposure to a Uv-B source.
QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE
Nile Monitors
DIET
Juveniles can be fed mainly on crickets gut-loaded and
coated lightly with a multivitamin/calcium/vitamin Dg
supplement. Mealworms and locusts may also be offered
as well as a weekly pinkie mouse.
 For older juveniles, king/super mealworms can substitute
for crickets, and larger mice can be offered.
However, unlike broad-snouted monitors, the narrow-
snouted Nile monitor should be fed only relatively small
vertebrates (body width < 2/3 the monitor's head width).
Monitors over 3 feet (1 m) long will continue to enjoy
king/super mealworms, but the bulk of their diet should
be filled by a ground meat mix.
Lean ground turkey supplemented with calcium carbonate 
and a complement of vitamins and minerals is an
appropriate diet. The turkey is either cooked or frozen for

Commercial meat-based carnivore diets may also be fed.
Adult Niles fare best if fed measured portions; excess
food may lead to obesity in adults
 For adults, feed an amount roughly equal to the volume
of the monitor's head every 2 days.
WATER
For small individuals, reptile water dishes, dog bowls and
plastic storage containers may suffice.
For adults, plastic cement mixing tubs or plastic "kiddie"
pools large enough for complete immersion are required.

 proper substrate, pool, plants and lighting.
HOUSING
Indoor enclosures should be at least 48 x 24 x 15 inches
(120 x 60 x 38 cm) for one adult box turtle.
Males and females should be housed separately.
Where the climate is appropriate it is better to house box
turtles outdoors.
Enclosure walls should be a minimum of 12-15" (30-40
cm) high to prevent escape from climbing walls.
If housed outdoors, walls should have an inside lip at the

Red-eared Sliders

Pet Care
By Marc Kramer, DVM
ORIGIN
Red-eared sliders are native to the Mississippi valley area
of the US from Illinois to the Gulf of Mexico and the
Southeastern US through Texas. Red-eared sliders have
established populations in non-native regions of the US,
including Central Park in New York City, and in suitable
habitats in Europe and South East Asia.
FREE-RANGING RED-EARED SLIDERS
During the day, sliders spend most of their time basking
in the sun or foraging for food.
 They prefer to bask on objects projecting out of the water
to spend the night.
SEXING
Red-eared sliders, especially juveniles, can be difficult
to sex.
 Gender in adults is primarily determined by external

 Various large plastic or fiberglass tubs can be considered

FEMALE
Hatchlings grow quickly and usually outgrow a 20-gallon
habitat within 2 years.
Recommended minimum enclosure size (in surface area)
for 4- to 5-inch (10-12 cm) long adult sliders is 2.5
square feet (2.3 square km) with an extra square foot for
each additional turtle.
The size requirement doubles for large turtles 8 inches

Water quality is of paramount importance. Sliders are
their messy eating habits and frequent defecation.
Therefore, a system needs to be in place for manage-
ment of water quality.
 Partial to full water changes can be performed (at a
minimum, weekly) with a siphon or by pouring out tank
water. The use of a filtration system will reduce (but not
eliminate) the frequency with which water needs to be
changed. The simplest for hatchlings is a canister filter,
which is designed to be either internal (submersible and
placed inside the aquarium) or external (fit on the
outside of the tank)

BASKING SITE
 The enclosure requires a basking area where the turtle
can emerge from the water to bask with an appropriately
placed basking light (a mercury vapor bulb is probably
the besty.
 Basking areas can consist of either islands or platforms
established at the water line of the tank or areas built
from the bottom of the tank (bricks or stones) and
emerging to the surface.
 Foating cork bark and "turtle ramps" have also been
used successfully.

RADIOGRAPHY
Aquatic turtles will often sit still for radiographs and
typically do not require any sedation.
 A dorsoventral projection can be taken with the animal
placed on top of the radiograph cassette.
 A cranial-caudal projection, important for evaluating the
lung fields, can be taken by turning the x-ray tube 90
degrees and projecting the beam horizontally onto the
cassette.
 A lateral view can also be obtained if desired.

ORIGIN/ FREE-RANGING HABITAT
Arid grassland savannahs of Africa from the Sudan south
to the Cape Province of South Africa
SUITABILITY AS PETS
Wild-caught leopard tortoises suffer from stress and many
diseases; therefore, captive-bred animals are best.
 It is a generally docile species and breeds well in captivity.
PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS
 The leopard tortoise is large and uniquely marked, with
primarily a yellow carapace and high contrast black
markings.
The carapace is relatively highly domed, with a height
usually greater than half its width.
SEXING AND REPRODUCTION
 Free-ranging leopard tortoises are not sexually mature
until 12-15 years of age, although captive-raised 
individuals may mature by age 6.
 Males have a longer and thicker tail than females
Mature adult females have more elongated rear claws
than males.

allowing some flexibility of shell edges. The plastron is
cartilaginous or partly ossifed. These adaptations allow
them to swim and move at increased speed.
 The head is narrow with a long snout with the nostrils
opening at its end. The neck is rather long but can be
completely withdrawn into the shell.
 The feet are broadly webbed and paddle-like, and only
the three inner digits have nails.
 The front edge of the spiny softshell turtle is usually
covered with tubercles.
 The overall color of the shell is olive or grayish-brown with 
darker spots and a cream border. The plastron is usually
much lighter colored and unmarked.
SEXING AND REPRODUCTION
 Males have longer and thicker tails. The coloring is more
contrasting, and the shell has a rougher texture. The shell
of females is smoother with blotches rather than spots.
 Mating takes place underwater, and females can lay 1-2
clutches of 4-30 eggs in sand during the spring with
eclosion taking place in late summer or autumn.

The northern populations are active from April to
September but the southern ones are active year-round.
HOUSING
Because of their aggressive behavior, spiny softshell
turtles should be housed alone in large aquariums. Extra
space is necessary if housed as breeding pairs
This species is highly aquatic and should be housed in a
large aquarium (100-200 L [26-53 gal] tank for one
adult) with a small terrestrial area for basking (a piece of
cork bark or a large log or tree root will do nicely)
A water depth of 20-30 cm (8-12 inches) is adequate.
Water quality is very important. The water should be
changed frequently to remove food remnants and other
waste, and pH should be kept slightly acid (6.0-6.5).
 This enclosure should be maintained as a freshwater
Water temperature should be 22-27°℃ (72-80°F).
The bottom of the tank can be barren, but ideally there
should be a 2-5 cm (0.8-2.0 inches) layer of fine sand
so the animals can bury themselves in the substrate.
 The basking area should allow the turtle to get
completely out of the water and be exposed both to
ultraviolet (UvB) and incandescent lighting.
Aquarium plants can be used as decorative items but
DIET
 Their natural diet, which is mainly carnivorous, consists of
invertebrates (e.g., earthworms, snails, crustaceans.

insects), fish, amphibians and their larvae and occasion-
ally, plant matter.
Usually, softshell turtles are eager eaters and readily take
pelleted food, minces of raw meat and fish, snails,
minnows and other small fish, shrimp, earthworms and
almost any animal prey that they can swallow.
 Pelleted food will not foul the water as quickly as other 
food items, and live prey, especially wild-caught fish and 
snails, can transmit some pathogens to the turtle.
The diet should be supplemented with daily calcium and
weekly vitamins.
RESTRAINT
Athough most chelonian species are gentle and don't
pose many diffculties in handling and restraint, soft-
shells, especially adult individuals, are more aggressive

ANESTHESIA
 In the author's experience, the best anesthetic protocol
is propofol (10-14 mg/kg Iv) given alone or followed by
endotracheal intubation and isoflurane. Even when
propofol is used alone, because of the induced apnea,
all individuals should be intubated and maintained under
0xygen and assisted ventilation (2-4 breaths/minute).
 A number of different tranquilizers and other injectable
anesthetics have been used in reptiles, but their effects
are usually erratic and tend to prolong anesthetic recovery.
QUICK REFER ENCE GUIDE
Spiny Softshell Turtles
MOST COMMON DISORDERS
problems that afflict other chelonian species, e.g..
malnutrition, metabolic bone disease and bacterial
infections.
 Because of their aggressive behavior it is common to see
bite wounds and other trauma in individuals kept in pairs
or small groups
Softshell turtles are very prone to skin trauma and
infections, which frequently develop into deeper or
systemic infections. These conditions arise as a result of
a number of predisposing factors, such as improper
husbandry (low water temperature, high pH, poor water
quality, abrasive sand or substrate) and malnutrition.
ZOONOTIC POTENTIAL
 Aquatic turtles have been associated mostly with trans-
mission of Saimoneffa spp. and other enteric bacteria.
Other pathogens that can be transmitted are Aeromonas
spp., Campyobacter spp. and Mycobacterium spp.
Good husbandry and nutrition and appropriate hygiene
measures after handling turtles and their enclosures
make transmission highly improbable.

Aligator snapping turtles require large tanks for housing.
Alligator Snapping Turtles
CAPTIVE HOUSING
 Aligator snapping turtles need an aquatic environment.
 They do not need basking sites.
 Hatchlings can be housed together, but adult turtles
should be maintained in separate enclosures.
 Turtles housed in mixed multispecies exhibits will often
prey upon their cagemates.
Hatchlings may be housed in a 20- to 50-gallon tank,
 depending on number.
Juveniles (6-12 in [15-30 cm] carapace length) may be
housed in 100-gallon aquariums or smaller stock tanks.
 Adults need an 8o0-gallon or larger tank or pond.
 A powerful filtration system is needed to keep the water
clean.
 Submerged rocks or logs should be provided for the turtle 
to hold on to with its tail while under water. It is ideal to
place them at a depth that allows the turtle to reach the
surface with its nose to breathe without having to let go.
 A floating piece of wood or other material for hiding under
will provide the turtle with an added sense of security.
ENVIRONMENTAL TEMPERATURE
Water temperature should be maintained at 70-80°F
(23-25°C).
Alligator snappers need a photoperiod of 8-12 hours.
Because the turtle spends most of its time submerged,
basking and Uv lights are unnecessary.
DIET

 Hunting involves remaining still and using the vermiform
 appendage on its tongue to attract prey.
 In the wild, these turtles eat fish, frogs, snails, crayfish,
insects, snakes, worms, clams, ducklings, aquatic plants,
carrion, small alligators, nutria and other turtles.
They have also been documented eating floating fruit,
gass, nuts and flowers that have fallen into the water.
 In captivity, these turtles can be fed fish (guppies,
minnows, goldfish, or larger—alive or dead), crayfish,
cooked chicken or beef, beef liver or heart, mice, rats,
chicks and commercial turtle food.
They should also be offered vegetable matter, such as
water hyacinth, water lettuce, carrots, apples, grapes,
cherries and bananas

DIET
Mud turtles are opportunistic carnivores or omnivores.
The young are generally carnivores, with larger amounts of
 vegetation added to the diet with age.
 Adults should be fed 2-3 times per week; hatchlings are
fed daily.
 Variety of diet is essential to maintaining good nutrition,
and a mixture of insects, worms, snails, fish and
vegetation should be offered.
Commercial turtle diets are also widely available
Calcium supplementation is essential. Powdered calcium
can be sprinkled on all foods. If the turtle is kept indoors

Pionus parrots also have a distinctive musky odor, which
is generally most evident during the breeding season.
 It is recommended that the owner provide a consistent
amount of interaction and enrichment time.
 Physical enrichments include increased physical
complexity within the cage. Foraging enrichments require
the parrots to chew and sort through, open, and/or
manipulate objects to get to food.
 Pionus should be encouraged to interact with people to
reduce the possibility of possessive attachment.
To maximize socialization, the bird should be exposed to
many new stimuli when it is young.

Pionus are monomorphic so sexing must be determined
via endoscopy (preferred if breeding) or DNA sexing.
QUICK REFER ENCE GUIDE
Pionus Parrots
 The distinctive coloration of each species is not fully
appreciated until adulthood.
HOUSING
 The enclosure should be as large as possible -
minimum of 20 x 24x 40 inches (50 x 60 x 100 cm)
with enough space for the bird to freely flap its wings.
Bar spacing should be 7/8" (2.2 cm) for most pionus
species. Small birds, such as duskies and white-caps,
should have no more than 3/4" (1.8 cm) space between
bars to prevent the bird's head from becoming stuck.
Newspaper is a suitable substrate in the cage tray so the
droppings may be monitored.
 Wood and rope-type toys provide proper outlets for their 
energy and curiosity.
A variety of toys, including foraging or puzzle toys, will
improve environmental enrichment.
Abundant branches and extra wood for chewing should
be added to the enclosure.
 Free-fying pionus should be protected from common
household dangers: glass windows and doors, mirrors
and glass-fronted picture frames (if frightened, the bird
may fly into the reflection); open doors, ceiling fans, hot
cooking oils/pots and pans, open containers of water
(toilets), toxic houseplants, dogs, cats, children.
Caged pionus should be protected from potential toxins:
cigarette smoke, overheated nonstick (polytetrafluro-
ethylene-coated) cookware, chocolate, avocado, salt,
alcohol, pesticides, toxic fumes, easily dismantled toys,

VACCINES
 Eclectus parrots are susceptible to polyomavirus infections
and death, even as adult birds. They are also susceptible
to herpesvirus (Pacheco's disease). vaccines to protect
against both viral diseases are produced by Biomune, but
only the polyomavirus vaccine (PSITTIMUNE@ APV) is
USDA-registered and recommended for routine use.
 Serological studies have demonstrated that neonatal,

far back as 1402. Today's canary fanciers pursue a
wide range of activities, including preserving old and 
rare breeds as well as breeding new color mutations.

HOUSING
One bird kept as a single pet will be content.
 Males must be housed separately from other males to
prevent fighting. but they may be kept within visual or
auditory range to stimulate singing.
Group housing for mixed ages and sexes will work only if
the cage has sufficient perches and feeding stations.
Housing for a pet canary should be indoors or protected
by mosquito screening if placed outdoors.
The cage size should be at least 10 x 10 x 18 inches (25
x25 x 46 cm) or 20 x 16 x 16 inches (50 x 50 x 40 cm).
 The cage setup should be clean, secure, safe and easy

Fancy pigeons (e.g., fantails, pouters, archangels)
ORIGIN
 The rock dove is ubiquitous and has been domesticated
for over 5,0o0 years. It was first domesticated in the
Middle East and Egypt.
FREE-RANGING HABITAT
Pigeons have adapted well to human settlements and
seem to prefer to live in cities.
In the wild, they are cliff nesters, and buildings offer
enough flat areas to nest comfortably.
Free-ranging pigeons have the ability to "home," i.e., find
their way back to their nests, and racing pigeons have 
been selected for this ability.
Fancy and meat pigeons have generally lost the homing

the ability to bite very hard.
Racing pigeons have been bred as high-activity, elite
athletes, so they do not do very well inside a house.
However, if protected from predators, they can make
good pets in an aviary.
PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS
Pigeons have very large, bilobed crops and are unique in
that both parents make "crop milk" for their young up to
10-14 days of age.
 They have small uropygial glands, so most of their water-
proofing is achieved through the use of powderdown.
 They have no gallbladder, and their cecae are very small.
BEHAVIOR
 Pigeons are generally monogamous and mate for life.
 They establish a definite pecking order in the loft and
may scalp the lower-ranking birds if they are overcrowded.
Pigeon racers commonly use mating behavior to their
and letting them see each other before the race, so they
fly home faster to their mates ("widowhood").
CAPTIVE HOUSING
 Pigeons are generally housed in outdoor lofts large
enough to allow them to fly up to flat perches.
 The lofts usually contain separate sections for young
birds, hens, breeders and the racing team.
 Breeder lofts contain nest boxes or cages, and lofts for 
racing or show birds contain flat perches, which best
support their foot structure.

 Show birds are sometimes housed in individual cages.

Supplemental heat or cooling is usually not necessary.
but in cold areas the lofts are usually insulated for winter.
DIET
There are a number of commercially available pigeon
diets, most based on seed or grain.
 Protein content for pigeons' diets ranges from 12-18%.
 Grit is necessary for grinding of the grain in the ventric-
ulus;: pigeons consume whole seeds, including the hull.
 Mineral supplementation is necessary if only grain is fed.
Mineral blocks should be available. Free-flying birds will
forage for minerals on the ground if they are deficient.
Many vitamin and racing supplements are also available.
RESTRAINT/ANESTHESIA

suppression, hepatitis and/or death.
Bacterial diseases - including E. cof and salmonellosis or
"paratyphoid" - usually cause green diarrhea; Saimonella
can cause joint infections and lameness.
VACCINES
 Most pigeon fanciers vaccinate birds for paramyxovirus
(PMv-1, inactivated virus in an oil emulsion), pox (live
attenuated virus) and sometimes Saimonella typhimuritm
(inactivated bacteria), depending on exposure potential.
LaSota Newcastle's vaccine for poultry has been shown
to be ineffective for preventing pigeon PMv-1.

 Routine preventive measures include periodic treatment
for coccidia, trichomonas and external parasites.
ZOONOTIC POTENTIAL
 Chlamydiosis and Cryptococcus neofommans are both
reported to be potential zoonoses.
Commonly, pigeon fanciers will acquire allergic lung 
disease from chronic exposure to the dust in their lofts.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
 It is diffcult to draw blood from the jugular vein due to
the lack of feather tracts on their necks, thick skin and
the presence of the plexus venosus intracutaneous
collaris, a large cuticular vascular plexus that can bleed
profusely when lacerated.
Blood can be drawn from the medial metatarsal vein or
the ulnar vein, but care must be taken not to damage

BREEDS / PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES
Various chicken breeds have developed from domestication
of the red junglefowl (Gaffus gaffus, fomma domesticus) for
different purposes: egg laying (leghorns), meat (Cornish) or
meat and eggs (Plymouth rocks, Rhode Island reds and
New Hampshire), as well as for exhibition.
LAWS AND PERMITS
 Maintaining, breeding, treating or commercially dealing with
chickens may be regulated by laws that govern the
protection of animals, property rights, exchange of goods,
liability, epornitics, food for human consumption, hunting
and transport of animals.
 Voluntary federal and state programs, such as the National
 Poultry Improvement Plan (NPIP), provide testing for specific 
diseases to facilitate transport of fowl.
 Local laws and city codes must be consulted for specific
management guidelines (e.g.: possibly limiting the number
 of roosters on a given amount of land).

 They are usually gentle but during the breeding season can
be aggressive, especially males.
 Chickens are easier to carry than other fowl, have less
messy stool and produce fresh eggs for consumption.
CAPTIVE HOUSING FOR ADULTS
Chickens are usually housed in groups outdoors where they
can eat grass and peck for bugs

 To prevent access by predators, wire sides or sheet metal
should be extended underground, and the top should be
covered with wire mesh.
Indoor/outdoor aviaries should be as large as possible (with
extra height for roosting).
 Roosts should be placed so that the tail or wing of a

 Although many pet chickens appear to get along well with 
other household pets, such as dogs, cats or ferrets, they 
should not be left unattended.
 Sleeping boxes or pen areas should be well-secured at 
night or when owners are not home so that these other
pets do not have access to the chickens.
 Pet chickens should be offered some daily access to the
outdoors and dust/sand areas for grooming.

calcium, protein and energy among the rations.
 It is best to feed commercial diets without coccidiostats,
 antifagellates or antimicrobials.
Extra-label use of medicated feed for production purposes
is not allowed.
 The availability of fresh green plants to the diet provides
the birds with nutritional diversity.
 Owners should refrain from offering their chickens table
 scraps, bakery goods and human foods in general.
As an occasional treat, commercial mealworms or
earthworms are relished.
Because obesity is a major problem in pet chickens,
portions of commercial poultry food should be measured.

Birds that are not allowed to freely roam should have
access to grit. The grit container should be emptied and
reflled regularly with various sizes of grit because birds
select only stones that are suitable for their body mass.
 Pellets or complete rations have an adequate supply of
calcium and should not be supplemented with lime or
crushed shell
 Fresh, clean water must be available at all times
DIET FOR CHICKS
 For the first 6 weeks of age, a 20% protein starter mash
should be offered, which can be gradually changed to a
16% protein formula after 8 weeks of age.
Feed should be provided to newly hatched chicks on a
large, flat plate on which they can move around and

 Highly skilled individuals can determine gender by
examining the cloaca in 1-day-old chicks or in adults.
QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE
Pet Chickens
Sexual dimorphism is evident in most breeds of chickens.
Behavioral clues,like dominance and certainmating
rituals, may suggest a gender but are not always indicative.
 Endoscopic examination of the gonads provides definitive 
determination of gender in species with similar morphologic
characteristics.
The laying pattern is nondeterminant (the hen continues to
lay if eggs are removed)
 The clutch size is 5-8 chicks, and the incubation period is
19-22 days

Swans are generally monogamous and pair-bond for life.
Swans prefer to build huge nests in bushy or wooded
areas that are somewhat secluded.
Cygnets learn to eat by themselves because from the
time they are hatched, the parents do not feed them.
Both parents care for the young. and cygnets are
 frequently seen riding on a parent's back in the water.
HOUSING
Most swans are easily kept in large, open areas with
 ponds or streams.
 They should have enough landscape to provide areas for
privacy, nesting. and some shade.
 Pond islands will help increase privacy and decrease
wulnerability to predation.
 Swans should not be kept on hard surfaces such as
increase the possibility of bumblefoot.
Good water quality is essential.
A constant supply of fresh water can be achieved by
using underwater filter systems with high water flow rate
 A depth of 3-4 feet of water is usually adequate for
swans.
QUICK REFER ENCE GUIDE
Swans
Swans tend to be territorial; thus, overcrowding or mixing
several species is not desirable.
 As a general rule, swans are best kept as a single pair in
a pen with a small pool.
Larger groups do best in open areas with a lake
DIET
Swans are filter-feeders and have specialized mouth
parts to help them eat.
Besides serrated beaks,they also have highly sensitive,
fleshy tongues that contain spiny projections.
 Free-ranging swans feed on a variety of food items
Cut here
Alula
including grass, seeds, and aquatic vegetation.
 In captivity, they should be fed a commercial food
especially formulated for waterfowl.
Corn or greens, such as lettuce, should be limited.
A commercial diet is made by Mazuri (www.mazuri.com)
in separate breeder, starter, and maintenance formulas.
RESTRAINT
The face and eyes of handlers should be protected from
possible injury from spurs (cocks) or beaks. The swan's
primary defenses are scratching with toenails, pinching

because the swan's massive wing strength can result in a
geater possibility of injury to the handler.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
 Swans should be examined once annually. The exam
should include a fecal direct and fecal Gram's stain, a
foot examination and body weight.
 Clostridium is frequently seen on Gram's stains and is
 not a problem in swans unless clinical signs are present.
 Pulse and respiration rates are not good indicators of
disease, because they vary so widely.

A male mandarin duck
ORIGIN / FREE-RANGING HABITAT
China; current range includes Russia, Siberia, China and
Japan. Feral populations exist in northern Europe.
 Mandarin ducks prefer any aquatic environment with
nearby trees, e.g., small lakes, rivers, marshes and 
 swamps in thick deciduous forests.
SUITABILITY AS PETS
 Mandarin ducks are one of the most popular ducks due
to their beauty and charming behavior.
 They are relatively easy to maintain in captivity.
BEHAVIOR
Free-ranging mandarin ducks are semi-migratory (can
cover 500 miles per day) and semi-colonial.
Most active foraging occurs at dawn and dusk.
 They are surface-feeders and hunt by head-dipping in
shallow waters.
 They spend much of the day resting in shady areas.
 Mandarin ducks are highly social.
 They seek out forests or dense branching during a molt.

Mandarin Ducks
A female mandarin duck
with black and white vertical stripes; abdomen and
underside white with gold/black flanks; olive/brown back
and tail; blue/green upper tail coverts and iridescent blue
scapulars; wing feathers are chestnut, orange, green and
eye-stripe is present and extends from the red bill.
Females are less colorful than males; they lack the
crested head; color varies from gray/white to brown/
geen; crown and sides of the head and neck are gray
with a white eye ring and streak; throat and foreneck are
white; breast and sides of the body are buff/gray; the back
is gray/brown with white spots on the under parts; wings
are similar to the males but lack sail feathers; bill is pink/
brown with a pale tip.
 During a molt the males may resemble the females but 
 can be distinguished by their red bill.
Mating
 Females bear a strong resemblance to the female wood
duck but can be distinguished by the longer and more
pointed eye stripe in the mandarin duck.
Juveniles resemble the females.
 The males guard duckings until they are able to fly.
Mandarin ducks are often monogamous.
CAPTIVE HOUSING
They require a predator-proof enclosure with some form
of shelter, a pond and a dry nest box.
 Overhead netting to limit wild bird access is recommended.
Shelters must be well ventilated with a minimum of 0.75
x 0.75 m (2.5 x 2.5 ft) floor space for each duck
The shelter may have solid, slatted or mesh floor, and
wheat straw or wood shavings are good litter materials.
QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE
Mandarin Ducks
Winter heating may be provided if necessary.
A pond area of at least 1.8 m? (19 ft?) is recommended.
Water must be fresh and preferably flowing.
Minimum water depth is 15 cm (6 inches).
Various designs of nest boxes are suitable. A raised
square plywood structure or hollowed log can be used:
inside diameter 22.5-30 cm (9-12 inches), an entrance
hole of about 10 cm (4 inches) diameter ideally
positioned near/overhanging the pond.
Nesting materials, such as wood shavings and grass,
should be provided.
Mandarins can be housed with other waterfowl species
but should be monitored for interspecific aggression.
 Winter-hardy; tolerant of a range of temperatures and 
humidity provided enclosure allows shelter from extremes.
ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT
 Shaded areas should be provided as well as hide areas.
A number of feeding stations should be provided or food
may be scattered to promote normal foraging behavior.
Live, nontoxic plants can decorate an enclosure.
 Social needs are met by housing in pairs or groups (e.g.
one male with several females).
DIET
 Free-ranging diet (often seasonal) consists of: seeds
acorns, grain, aquatic plants, other vegetation, worms,
insects, land snails, mollusks, small snakes and fish.
Captive diet may include: commercial waterfowl pellets,
fresh dark leafy greens and access to natural vegetation.
 Small amounts of assorted grains may also be fed but
QUICK REFER ENCE GUIDE
Mandarin Ducks
care must be taken not to overfeed.
Feeds designed for commercial ducks raised for meat
production are not suitable.
Grit should be provided, especially if grains are fed.
Ad fibritum access to clean, fresh water is essential.
Juveniles are best fed on dry crumbs (some water
initially): the addition of finely-chopped weeds or dark
greens and hard-boiled egg is useful to promote feeding.
RESTRAINT
 A net may be used if attempting restraint in a large
enclosure and/or if the animal is unfamiliar with handling.
 One hand may be used to loosely restrain the neck while
the other hand is placed under the breast and advanced
caudally to restrain the legs between the fingers. The
duck is then lifted and rested on one forearm with the
cranial end at the elbow and the caudal end pointing
holding the wings to prevent flapping.

DIET
Br
Free-ranging quail eat many kinds of grass seeds,
including white millet. Their protein sources include small
uvenile quail
worms, insect larvae and small invertebrates. They will
also consume grit.
Captive quail can be fed turkey starter, chicken starter or
game bird starter; breeding hens should have free choice
access to calcium (limestone or oyster shell).
Clean water is essential.

SPECIES AND SUBSPECIES
 Peafowl are in the pheasant family; 3 recognized species:
· Blue, Indian or common peafowl (Pavo cristatus)
·Green or scaled peafowl (Pavo muticus)
There are 3 subspecies of green peafowl:
o Javanese green peafowl (P m. muticus)
o Indo-Chinese green peafowl (P m. imperator)
° Western Burmese green peafowl (P m. spicifer)
· Congo peafowl (Afropavo congensis)
Many color mutations have derived from captive breeding.
ORIGIN / FREE-RANGING HABITAT
Blue peafowl are native to India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and
Nepal. Green peafowl are native to the Asian subcontinent,
Javanese green peafowl are found in southern Thailand
and Malaysia and also on the Indonesian island Java.
 Congo peafowl are native to central Africa, ranging

Blue peahens are more drab than males, with brown to
bronze-green coloration of the head and back. Their neck is
bronze-green cranially, fading to a buff and black mottled
pattern. Their crown has green to brown tips.
 The peacock's most distinctive feature is its tail or train,
which can be 4.6-5.3 ft (1.4-1.4 m) long. The display
feathers are actually elongated covert feathers, which are
made up of metallic barbs that are coppery bronze/gold/
dark green and are supported by the shorter retrices.
surrounded by rings of brilliant blue or green and copper.
 Males will molt and regrow their tail coverts in the fall.
Chicks are brown with a buff breast. First year males show
 a blue neck and breast and full plumage at 3 years of age.
Green peacocks/peahens
 Green peacocks differ from blue peacocks in that their
neck and cranial breast are green; their crown is more of
 a tuft than a fan. Green peahens have brighter plumage
than blue peahens.
Congo peacocks/peahens
Congo peacocks are primarily dark brown to black with a
blue to violet breast. The throat area and cranial neck are
devoid of feathers and are bright red in color. The crest is
made up of many white and black hair-like feathers.
 Congos lack the long train their Asian counterparts have.

Dimorphism occurs a few weeks after hatching.
 Peafowl are sexually mature at 3 years of age, although a
 yearling peahen may lay a fertile clutch if housed with a
mature male.
 One male may breed with multiple females
 Although they roost in trees, blue and green peafowl make
their nests on the ground. Congo peafowl nest in trees.
 Peahens typically start laying eggs in April and will lay eggs
every other day until a full clutch of 4-10 eggs is laid and
will continue to lay if the eggs are removed from the nest.
Incubation times vary from 27-30 days.
 Like other Galiformes, hatchling peachicks are precocial.
They may be housed in brooders until 2-3 months of age.
Baby peafowl (Pavo cristatus)
BEHAVIOR
Peafowl are diurmal and spend most of their time foraging
for food on the ground and in shallow water. At night they
will roost in trees, sometimes as high as 49 ft (15 m).
 They rarely fly but will if startled.
The most impressive aspect of the blue and green
peacocks is their ability to lift their tail feathers into a
large arc 5.9-6.9 ft (1.8-2.1 m) wide to attract females.
Males with the longest trains and largest ocelli are chosen
for mates more often and sire larger clutches.
 Peafowl have a very loud high-pitched cry that is often
 voiced during mating season or as an alarm call.
CAPTIVE HOUSING
 Adult peacocks require large enclosures to accommodate
their tails.

 The oral mucosa is non-pigmented and red in color for
the first year of life.
SEXING AND REPRODUCTION
Adult birds are monomorphic.
Crows are monogamous and solitary nesters.
The young are cared for by both sexes as well as other
 crows, usually older offspring.

and finally unlimited enclosure space of 10 x 30 x 15
feet (3 x 9 x 4.5 m)
 Wire cages can be used, but aviary neting is preferred.
 Protection must be provided from environmental
elements, predators, vermin and insects (i.e.,
mosquitoes, ants and bees).
 Perches should be selected to prevent pododermatitis
and splay leg. They should be variable in size and covered
with natural or artificial products (e.g., rope, Astroturfe).
ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT
 Cage furniture should not interfere with flight or cause
entrapment.
Environmental stimuli may include approved toys, forage/
browse and paper for shredding, caches and hiding food
DIET
 Free-ranging crows are omnivorous. They feed on a
variety of insects, small mammals, amphibians and
reptiles. They will consume grain, carrion, eggs and 
young of other birds, fruit and garbage.
 In captivity, they should be offered a nutritious and
complete diet. They can be fed commercial bird of prey
diets, insects (e.g., mealworms, waxworms,
gasshoppers), eggs, fruit, vegetables and grains.

Birds can also be handled with one hand by grasping the
tail and wing tips together.
ANESTHESIA
 Anesthetic technigues are identical to those
anesthesia (isofurane or sevoflurane) is preferred, initially
MOST COMMON DISORDERS
Most crows are admitted to veterinary hospitals due to
injury, usually vehicular or gunshot. Fractures of the legs

injuries. Electrocution and poisoning are also seen.
 Ectoparasites (feather lice) and endoparasites (coccidia,
GeorgeGastin
nematodes [Diplotriaena triceps], filaria [Solendidofara
caperata]) are treated in a standard manner as for
raptors or psittacine species.
 Crows are highly susceptible to West Nile virus. Birds can
be found acutely dead or with neurologic dysfunction.
The author has had success treating members of the
Corvidae family and other avian species with supportive
care (fuids, force-feeding. antimicrobials for secondary
 infections, hyper-immune sera from previously immunized
birds, and equine-based antibody products). If the birds
survive, recovery is on average of 2 weeks.
Aspergillosis, candidiasis and trichomoniasis are common
 in debilitated or immune-compromised birds.
QUICK REFER ENCE GUIDE
American Crows
American crows have been used for
tracking the spread of the West Nile virus.
VACCINES
There are no commercial vaccines approved for use in
crows. Extra-label use of equine vaccines against West
Nile virus has been tried in a variety of avian species.
ZOONOTIC POTENTIAL
Crows are avid consumers of carrion and other decaying
are exposed through their feeding practices.
Erysipelas mhusiopathiae, Pasteurella mu/tocida,
Salmonefla typhimurium, Francisella tularensis,
Mycobacterium avium and Campylobacter jejunf have
been isolated in crows.
 West Nile virus can be found in the body fuids, tissues
and excrement of affected birds.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Venipuncture is easily accomplished at the right jugular
vein. The ulnar and medial metatarsal veins can also be
used. Reference values may be obtained through the
International Species Inventory System (ISIS), raptor
centers and zoological institutions.

SEXING AND REPRODUCTION
Males tend to be larger and heavier than females and have
a slightly longer beak (males = longer than 6.3 in [16 cm]
and females = shorter than 6.1 in [15.5 cm]}.
 Toucans need choices for mate selection.
Castle Zoo,United
Sexual maturity is achieved at 3-4 years of age.
 Breeding season is April to September.
 Captive breeding is usually difficult.
 Palm logs or plywood boxes should be provided for nesting.
 Incubation lasts 16-18 days, 2-4 eggs are laid, and chicks 
fledge at 42-47 days.
In captivity, killing or mutilation of chicks by the parents is
common if not fed with appropriate sources of protein.
BEHAVIOR
 Tocos are territorial; they should not be housed with any
 other birds. They may be aggressive and prey upon others.
Juvenile toco toucan

jousting even through a wire mesh.
 Tocos are very active throughout the day, needing
considerable space and daily activities to keep them busy.
During sleep they rest the bill on the back and cover it
with the tail.
 Toco toucans bite hard if upset.
 Tame birds that do not receive sufcient attention may
become aggressive towards the owner.
CAPTIVE HOUSING
 Toucans are best housed alone or in compatible pairs to
avoid aggression.
QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE
Toco Toucans
Large, macaw-sized, horizontally-oriented enclosures are
needed in addition to outside playground space with
several perches.
Outdoor flights should be at least 8 ft x 12 ft x 6 ft (2.5
m x 3.6 m x 1.8 m).
 Perches may be made of natural bark-covered wood.
Feedersand waterpans shouldbe elevated aboveground
to prevent contact with feces and organic material
 The floor of the enclosure should be well drained and
easy to clean in order to avoid potential pathogenic
microorganism buildup and contact with parasite eggs.
The water dish for drinking/bathing should be at least 8 in
x 10 in (20 cm x 25 cm).
Nontoxic tree limbs, ornamental grasses or bamboo to
 defoliate and destroy may be provided for activity.
 A PVC pipe may be flled with substrate materials (e.g.-
mulch, wood chips) or chopsticks with fruits in the tube
(when the chopsticks come out the fruit is dropped down).
 Hanging toys approved for psittacines made of safe

DIET
Toucans require a pelleted diet low in iron content specific
for Ramphastidae. In addition, fruits may be offered, with
the exception of high-acid fruits, such as oranges, grape-
fruits, pineapples and tomatoes, which increase iron intake.
 Dietary items may be provided in a variety of ways, such
as offering large chunks instead of chopped.
 Commercially available crickets are important during the
breeding season.

White's tree frogs
(Litoria caerulea)
Pet Care
Filipe Martinho, DVM
ORIGIN/FREE-RANGING HABITAT
North and northeastern Australia and southern Papua,
New Guinea; introduced into New Zealand
White's tree frogs can be found in a variety of habitats,
from moist to relatively dry forests to even around human
settlements like parks and gardens, where they are
usually found climbing branches, bushes or trees.
SUITABILITYASPETS
White's tree frogs are popular amphibians in captivity
because of their moderate size and interesting behavior.
 They may be considered a beginner's frog.
PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS
 As with most members of this family, white's tree frogs
possess small discs at the tip of the digits, which function
as climbing aids. The fingers and toes are partly webbed.
 The skin is smooth and quite dry for an amphibian
because of its waxy secretions, which decrease excessive
water loss.
 Coloration is variable, ranging from brown to green,

vegetation, light intensity) or health status.
Some adult individuals, especially obese ones, can
develop large skin flaps over the eyes.
Males are smaller than females, often have a green tinge
 on the throat and are the only ones that call during
mating season.
BEHAVIOR
White's tree frogs are docile and can become relatively
tame to tolerate handling.
They are mostly nocturnal, remaining inactive during the
day to reduce water losses.
They are opportunistic predators,feeding on any insect,
small bird, mammal, frog or other prey they can fit into 
their mouths.
 The breeding period occurs between November and May.
and the males call loudly to attract female partners.
The 200-2000 eggs are laid at the surface of still water
bodies, and after 24 hours they sink to the bottom. The
eggs hatch after 3 days, and metamorphosis occurs 2
months later.
CAPTIVE HOUSING
 This is a moderately-sized and quite active frog that
needs a large enclosure in captivity. A terrarium 31 x 12
x 20 inches (80 x 30 x 50 cm) should be suitable for 1-2
adult individuals, but more space is desirable.
Since they are arboreal animals, a vertical terrarium is
more suitable than a horizontal one.
 A number of substrate materials, such as coconut fiber,
QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE
White's Tree Frogs
 potting soil (without fertilizers or pesticides), artificial grass
carpets or moist paper towels, can be used with safety.
Gravel, sand and small-sized tree bark should be
avoided, because these can be inadvertently swallowed
by the animals or cause skin irritation.
 A large but not very deep water bowl should be placed on
the bottom of the terrarium; the water should be free of
chlorine,chloramines and heawymetals and changed
frequently.
 Because the Uv lighting requirements for most amphibian
species are not completely known, it is best to include a
Uv bulb to help prevent nutritional disorders
ENVIRONMENTAL TEMPERATURE/HUMIDITY
 Daytime temperatures should be approximately 75-84°F
(24-29°C) and slightly lower at night.
 Heat should be provided by an incandescent or infrared
light bulb that is placed at a safe distance from the
animals to prevent thermal burns.
 A temperature gradient should be created inside the
terrarium, with a slightly cool corner and a slightly
warmer basking spot, so the frogs can choose the most
 adequate temperature.
ENVIRONMENTALENRICHMENT
Hideouts, such as hollow logs or tilted flower pots,
should be provided.
Live sturdy plants can be safely used; besides the
aesthetic function, they provide extra climbing surfaces
and hideouts and help to maintain humidity in the
terrarium.
QUICK REFER ENCE GUIDE
White's Tree Frogs
Because of their climbing habits, white's tree frogs need
branches and vines across the terrarium.
Pants used in the terrarium should be nontoxic and 
oxalate-free; live prey, such as crickets, may feed on 
some oxalate-containing plants and can cause oxalate
toxicity in frogs after the prey are ingested.
DIET
 Adult frogs can be fed 2-3 times a week with a variety of
invertebrates (crickets, cockroaches, earthworms, silk-
worms, wax moths, mealworms and other appropriately-
sized prey).
Items high in fat, such as wax moths and flour beetles,
 should be fed sparingly.
If flour beetles are fed, only those that have recently
shed their skin should be offered (to prevent gastro-
intestinal blockage), and their heads should be crushed
prior to feeding to prevent digestive wall trauma from
their mouth armour.
All food prey should be gut-loaded or lightly dusted with
vitamins and calcium before feeding.
Wild-caught prey may also be fed but can potentially
introducepathogensortoxins.
 Rodent prey should not be fed in captivity because of the
tendency to induce obesity.
RESTRAINT
talc-free, latex gloves, not only to minimize contact with
the animals' defensive skin secretions, but also to reduce
trauma to their delicate skin.
QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE
White's TreeFrogs
 They should be grasped around the forelegs or
 immediately anterior to the hind legs.
Small individuals and tadpoles can also be examined
while inside transparent plastic containers or plastic bags
containing water.
ANESTHESIA
Amphibians can be anesthetized with baths of a buffered
tricaine methanosulfonate (MS-222) solution. The con-
centration of MS-222 can range from 0.2 g/L for tadpoles
to 1 g/L for adults; induction time is about 30 minutes.
 The ideal anesthetic plane is characterized by loss of
righting and corneal reflexes and abdominal erythema.
Deeper planes of anesthesia can be achieved by longer
baths; the animal loses its withdrawal reflex while
maintaining a visible heartbeat.
 After reaching the desired anesthetic plane, the animal
should be placed in a container with well-oxygenated
water.
 At the end of the procedure or to remove excess MS-
222, the animal should be rinsed with clean water.
Isofurane can also be delivered at 5% saturation via
anesthetic chamber. A small volume of water should be
placed inside the chamber to minimize dehydration.
Induction takes 5-20 minutes, and recovery is less than
100 minutes.

Obesity (affected animals can develop large skinflaps
over the eyes that can obscure vision)
Obese individuals can also be at increased risk of
developing liver and heart disease, although rarely
reported in amphibians.
 Some animals frequently fed rodent prey can develop
lipid keratopathy with deposition of cholesterol crystals
over the cornea.
 All amphibians should have their stool checked for
parasites and should be medicated appropriately.
ZOONOTIC POTENTIAL
 Few, if any, zoonoses are reportedly transmitted by
White's tree frogs, but there are anecdotal reports of
isolation of Leptospira spp., Listeria monocytogenes,
Yersinia enterocolitica and atypical Mycobacteria in other
amphibian species. The ability of these species to transmit
these pathogens to human beings remains controversial.

COMMON SUBSPECIES
 All tomato frogs belong to the Microhylaidae family and 
the genus Dyscophus. There are 3 subspecies recognized.
D. antongiff is not common in the pet trade because
their importation out of Madagascar is prohibited under
CITES Appendix I. They are the most vividly red of the
three subspecies.

 The bright red color of tomato frogs serves as a warning
to predators; the skin contains a toxic secretion.
QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE

CAPTIVE HOUSING
Terrestrial vivariums are best for tomato frogs. An
enclosure that is 3 feet (91.4 cm) long. 15 inches (38
cm) deep and 18 inches (45.7 cm) in height will easily
house 3-4 adult tomato frogs.
Because the frogs burrow, a substrate of at least 2.5
inches (6.3 cm) in depth should be provided. Coconut
coir makes an excellent substrate and holds humidity well.
Ventilation is important, so partial screening on the
enclosure's sides and top is essential
 Only shallow water bowls (with either spring or filtered
water) should be used, as the frogs are poor swimmers.
A low-intensity UvB full-spectrum light is advisable to
help prevent metabolic bone disease disorders
ENVIRONMENTALTEMPERATURE/HUMIDITY
Free-ranging tomato frogs
burow most of the day.
Temperature should not get above 80°F (26°C) for
juveniles or above 85°F (29°C) for adults. Juvenile tomato
frogs cannot tolerate heat extremes as well as adults.
 A temperature gradient is preferred. The cooler side of
the enclosure can drop to 75°F (23°C).
Nighttime temperature should be 60-65°F (15.5-18.3°C).
A humidity of 70-80% is best for tomato frogs.
Spraying the enclosure with filtered spring water several
times daily helps to maintain high humidity.

 Food items that ingest food can be gut-loaded with a
commercial insect chow. Some food items (e.g., wax
worms and phoenix worms) do not eat.
Food items should alsobe dusted with a vitamin/mineral
powder made for reptiles/amphibians before feeding to
further enhance their nutritional status.
Adults are fed every 2-3 days; juveniles are fed daily.
If not ingested, live food items should be removed from
the enclosure within a few hours of being introduced.

Horned frogs are best housed singly; even quite similar-
sized individuals may be taken as prey.
 Ease of cleaning the enclosure should always be a priority.
Horned frogs are natural burrowers, so several centimeters
of substrate (sphagnum moss/eaf litter/coconut husk fiber/
soil} are recommended, although more hygienic options of
unbleached paper towels or nontoxic foam rubber are
acceptable if suffcient hiding places are provided.

DL
Adequate hiding places (distributed throughout the

ENVIRONMENTAL TEMPERATURE
A gradient is necessary. The recommended temperature
range is 73-869F (23-309℃) with a drop of a few degrees at
night; they are generally quite hardy at lower temperatures.
DIET
 Free-ranging horned frogs eat almost anything that willfit 
in their mouths.
 In captivity, a variety of invertebrates and small rodents is
recommended.
Rodents should be limited in quantity due to concerns
 over nutritional issues for amphibians (excesses of vitamin 
A, other vitamins, fat).
Note that in the wild these frogs do not feed for several
months a year; overfeeding is very common in captivity.

 X tropicalis are generally smaller and darker in color and
require slightly higher temperatures (23-26°℃ [73-79°F]).
ORIGIN /FREE-RANGING HABITAT
Clawed frogs are widely spread in sub-Saharan Africa.
 There are feral breeding populations in many places in 
the United States, Europe, South America and Africa.
Clawed frogs are generally found in still, often fairly
stagnant/muddy bodies of water. Xenopus faevis usually
live in semi-arid grassland.
PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS
 The body of these frogs is dorsoventrally flattened, with
small eyes positioned dorsally on the head.
 They lack tongues and teeth.

SEXING AND REPRODUCTION
Females are larger and generally more plump than males.
 They also have obvious slightly protruding papillae (labial
flaps) around the cloaca, which the males lack.
 Breeding occurs after spring rains, which can be simu-

 These are quite messy frogs, and filtration is necessary.
This must involve as little water disturbance as possible,
however, as the frogs are sensitive to water movements.
Lighting is controversial, but overhead lower-intensity full-
spectrum lighting is probably advisable, with timed
photoperiod (12:12).

Clawed frogs are feral in many places and have been
implicated as a reservoir and/or agent of spread of
chytrid fungus, to which they are relatively resistant. As a
result, their keeping is controlled in several places.
Permits are required for owning. selling and transporting
these frogs in several U.S. states.
 Due to their relative resistance and potential carrier state
they are in a collection with other amphibians, including
other aquatic frogs.
 Historically and to some extent still, clawed frogs are
widely used as research animals, originally for human
pregnancy diagnosis and now more for genetic and
developmental studies.

BEHAVIOR
Free-ranging fire-belly toads hibernate from September/
October to April/May in groups of 2-6; they hide under 
 rocks, vegetation or decomposing wood.
 The breeding period starts around May and lasts until
September, although there is no peak of reproductive
activity, and the eggs are laid gradually during this period.
 Although their skin produces a number of toxic and
irritating substances, as most amphibians do, they are
prey of a number mammals and birds.
 When threatened, they exhibit a characteristic display.
exposing the bright red and dark belly, announcing their
toxicity to a potential predator. This behavior is usually
lost in captive-bred individuals.
CAPTIVE HOUSING
 Oriental fire-belly toads should be housed in small groups
 of equal-sized individuals in an aqua-terrarium with 1/3 to
1/4 land area.
A 24 x 12 x 12 inch (60 x 30 x 30 cm) aquarium can
house up to 4 adult toads, although a larger area is more
desirable.
 The bottom surface can be bare or covered with fine river
sand.
 The water should be filtered (a mechanic filter for fresh-
water fish is suitable) and free of chlorine, chloramines
and heavy metals; it should be changed every 1-2 weeks.
Although the ultraviolet (Uv) needs of most amphibian

Fre-belly toads should be handled with slightly moist,
talc-free latex gloves, not only to minimize contact with
the animals' defensive skin secretions but also to reduce
trauma to their delicate skin.
 They should be grasped around the forelegs or with a
loose grip around the whole body.
Small individuals and tadpoles can also be examined
while inside transparent plastic containers or plastic bags

White's tree frogs, but there are anecdotal reports of
isolation of Leptospira spp., Listena monocytogenes,
Yersinia enterocofitica and atypical Mycobactera in other
amphibian species. The ability of these species to transmit
these pathogens to human beings remains controversial.

SEXING
 Axolotls reach sexual maturity at 18-24 months of age.
Adults are sexually dimorphic, with females having a
heavier build and shorter and broader heads than males.
Males also have several enlarged glands around the
cloaca.
After breeding, females may lay up to 300 eggs over

 Small pebbles should be avoided as substrate to avoid
being ingested.
Only individuals of the same size should be housed
together to avoid cannibalism.
 Clay pots or sections of PVC pipe may be used as hiding
places.
ENVIRONMENTALTEMPERATURE
 Axolotls prefer temperatures around 62.6-64.4°F
(17-18°C) but can usually tolerate temperatures ranging
from 57-68°F (14-20°℃)
The water should be on the soft side with a pH of 6.9-7.6.
 Chlorine and chloramines should be removed from the
water as these may cause skin and gill problems
DIET
 As carnivores, they may consume small prey items in the
wild, such as fish, aquatic insects and worms.
 In captivity, they can be fed a variety of commercial fish
pellets, crickets, shrimp, bloodworms, earthworms,
 
mealworms and waxworms.
RESTRAINT
 If necessary, axolotls may be handled gently but firmly
with powder-free gloves, as they may easily slip out of the
holder's grasp.
 If using a net, a fine mesh is recommended to avoid 
abrasion to the gills and skin.
MOST COMMON DISORDERS
 Poor water quality due to poor filtration or inadequate
water changes is the major problem of captive axolotls.

Long finned and butterfy koi varieties are gaining in
popularity. However, in a pond without adequate room or
in crowded conditions, the long fowing fins are prone to
 traumatic injuries and tend to develop ragged margins.
SEXING AND REPRODUCTION
 Adult females have a rounder body shape and are less
 streamlined in appearance when compared to adult males.
Spawning occurs most often in the spring when water
temperatures approach 68°F (20°℃).
 Spawning is less likely to occur in indoor ponds (where
environmental cues for spawning do not typically occur) or
when fish are under stress (e.g.,; overcrowded conditions.

 The males will then fertilize the released eggs.
 Koi will eat the eggs, so many farmers and hobbyists
remove the pads or mats if they desire a hatch.
BEHAVIOR
Koi are very food-oriented and will quickly recognize their
owners as a source of food and follow them around the
pond with their mouth open!

CAPTIVE HOUSING
 Due to their large size as adults, koi are best kept in
ponds instead of aquaria.
A recommended volume for 1 full-grown, adult koi is
 500-1000 US gallons (2.27-4.5 kL). Small koi may be
raised in smaller volume ponds or aquaria initially.
Most owners keep koi in overcrowded situations, which
predisposes them to stress, poor water quality and
disease outbreaks
 Life support equipment needs to be of sufficient size and
 durability to provide adequate water flow, biological
fltration, waste solids removal and ease of maintenance.

ENVIRONMENTAL TEMPERATURE
The 0ptimum temperature for koi is 68-75°F (18-24°℃
They can survive in temperatures 32-95*F (0-32°℃).
 Koi housed in outdoor ponds are very susceptible to
 disease out-breaks in the spring as water temperatures
gadually increase. For this reason, owners in cool
climates often winter their koi indoors.

DIET
 Koi may be fed a commercial pelleted feed. It is

betta (and occasionally a female) is present.
The opercula (gill plates, which cover and protect the
glls) are fared wide open, exposing a membrane inside
the opercula, the colors intensify and the fins are
extended, making the fish appear larger and more
threatening.
The fish will occasionally exhibit this behavior when the
owner appears. This reaction can also be induced with
the use of a mirror. When the male sees the "other"
male, he will typically display.
 Repeated induction of flaring or displaying may cause
stress in the fish.
Betta half moon
Bettas are usually found at the top of the water column.
Males will produce bubble nests by mixing air with a
mucoid fuid in their buccal cavity.
 The nest is protected by the male after spawning.
 The presence of a nest is usually associated with a
healthy betta.
CAPTIVE HOUSING
 Aquaria: 1-2 gallons of water is sufficient, although
bettas can be housed with other community species.
 Males must be housed individually, as they will fight.
Water quality issues may arise when they are kept in
small bowls.
The ideal pH is 7.0 with a range of 6.8-7.5.

PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS
Seahorses have several unique anatomical features,
although the body plan is essentially similar to other fish.
These features can make common diagnostic or
therapeutic procedures more diffcult or impractical
 They lack scales, instead having dermal bony plates
(which can make injections difficult).
 They swim upright.
The mouth is small, located at the end of a long snout.
 Gills appear rounded and are inaccessible due to the
small opening: this makes gill biopsies impractical,
although branchial washing may be performed.
 The eyes can move independently.
 The tail is long and muscular (used for gripping or
"hitching").
Seahorses have some color change ability (variable with

for harboring pests and predators.
Aeration should be reasonable, but significant water
currents should be avoided as much as possible.
 Artificial lighting is not generally considered necessary for 
 the seahorses but will enhance viewing pleasure.
 Tank companions are generally best avoided, with the
possible exception of very inoffensive fish, such as
blennies or gobies as "clean up" fish. Seahorses do not
generally compete well with other fish.
Gastropods may also be used for clean-up purposes.
Adequate hitching sites are essential.
Seahorses naturally hunt in nooks and crannies—a
reasonable variety should be provided.

DIET
 Any small invertebrates may be offered.
 Typically frozen or live mysids and/or brine shrimp are fed
and enrichment strategies used.
RESTRAINT / ANESTHESIA
 As with all fish, handling with rinsed powder-free gloves
(possibly vinyl preferred) is recommended.
 Standard fish anesthesia with buffered MS-222 (tricaine
methanesulphonate) is appropriate; 0.05-0.1 g/L (50-
100 ppm) may be used for induction.
MOST COMMON DISORDERS
 Gas problems: may be gas in brood pouch, gas bubbles
on tail or gas bladder overinflation. Acetazolamide may
help, particularly with brood pouch or gas bladder issues.
 Mycobacteriosis; presentation may often be relatively
acute, although chronic wasting is also possible (typically
sporadic cases).
vibriosis is common in stress situations.
Most parasites of marine fish can also affect seahorses.
 Systemic bacterial, fungal (phaeophyomycosis) and viral
diseases

VACCINES
No vaccines are available or routinely used in pet
seahorses, although some public aquaria have reportedly
used vibrio bacterins.
ZOONOTIC POTENTIAL
Seahorses commonly suffer from mycobacteriosis and
other bacteria, which may be possible zoonotic risks.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Because they are relatively delicate, they are not
to rear successfully.

Leg iv
Giant spiders, commonly called tarantulas, are
arthropods belonging to the Arachnid class, Araneae
 order, Mygalomorph suborder and Theraphosidae
family. Brachypeima sp., Aphonoperma palfidum and
A. albiceps are part of CITES Appendix Il.
PET POTENTIAL
Attractive due to graceful movements and bright colors.
Easily managed with proper species husbandry information.
Leg
Relatively tame and solitary animals.
Recommended species for the beginner include: B. smithi
(red knee), B. albopilosum (curly hair), B. vagans (red
rump), Grammostola rosea (Chile rose), A. avicuraria
(pink toe), P cambridgei (Trinidad chevron).
 Not suitable pets for children.
Leg i
 Giant spiders should not be handled.
A few genera (not of the Theraphosidae family) have
lethal venom (e.g., Atrax spp., Phoneutria spp.)
All adults can impart extremely painful bites with
subsequent allergic reactions that may be serious.

such as non-toxic plants, rocks, branches, driftwood, logs
or cork or paper towel tubing.
Stacked paper egg crates can be used for hiding and
climbing.
DIET
 Cockroaches are omnivores and eat almost anything
organic.
 Free-ranging roaches eat fruit and dead animal matter.
 In captivity, they thrive best on fresh dark leafy green and
dark yellow vegetables and dry dog biscuits or chicken or
fish food.
 Water must be available at all times but provision must
be available to prevent drowning. Options include wet
paper towels changed daily, a crock bowl with rocks or a
synthetic material (to reduce mold) or a chick waterer
with a circular piece of sponge.
Branches and rocks provide great

SUITABILITY AS PETS
 Hissing cockroaches are unique and interesting pets that
can be handled by children because they are docile and
don't bite.
They are also raised as food items for some reptiles.
 While being handled, they may hiss loudly (but
harmlessly), which accounts for their name.
They are slow-moving and easy to handle.
They are hardy and resilient and won't die quickly if left
without food.
