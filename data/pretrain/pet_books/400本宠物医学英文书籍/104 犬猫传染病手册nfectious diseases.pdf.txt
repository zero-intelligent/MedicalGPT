Preface
The5-Minute Veterinary Consult Clinical Companion:Canine and Feline Infectious
Diseases and Parasitologyisa quick-reference text designedmainly for clinicians,but
alsoforstudentsofveterinarymedicine.It assumesabasicknowledgeof infectious and
parasiticdiseases.There areseveralexcellent texts availableininfectious diseases of
bothcats and dogs and alsomany detailingtheparasites of thesespecies.Theinfectious
disease textsoffer detailed informationregarding theepidemiology andpathophysiol-
ogy ofdisease,clinicalmanifestations,iagnostictechniques,pathology,and therapeu
ticregimens,and most parasitology texts detail lifecycles,parasitemorphology,and
pathology,withlittle emphasison diagnosis and therapy.Although theseareexcellent
referencetextswith aplaceinveterinarylibraries and ontheshelvesof theclinicalvet-
erinarian,there arefewifany textsthatincludebothinfectiousandparasiticdiseases
inonevolume.Thistextwaswritten tomakeclinicallyrelevantinformationonboth
infectious andparasiticdiseasesofcats anddogs availableforquickreference in the
workplace
The5-MinuteVeterinaryConsultClinicalCompanion:Canineand FelineInfectious
DiseasesandParasitologyisdesignedtohelpthereaderrecognizevariousinfectious and
parasitic diseasescommon inNorthAmerica andidentify appropriate diagnostic tests
toperform.Drug dosages havebeen presentedin tableformat toallow thebusyclini-
cian to access therapeuticinformation quicklybetween appointments.Many of the
chaptershavebeenadaptedfromtheInfectiousDiseasesectionofthethirdeditionof

ORGANIZATIONANDFORMAT
LikeThe5-MinuteVeterinary Consult:CanineandFeline,the organization ofthisbook
isbased on an alphabeticlisting of,in most instances,the etiologicagent.Sometimes
themore common version ofa disease entity is used asa heading(e.g.,Tick Bite
Paralysis,EarMites)insteadof thename of the etiologic agent.Although thismight
aggravate thepuristwe haveadhered to thisformat to aid thefundamentalprinciple
ofthetext-thatofaquickreference

PREFACE
Comments.This latter section often alludes to the zoonotic potential of the agent in
question and occasionallyincludes comments by the authorsbased on their experience
of the disease.Each section is intentionallykept short,with theinformation presented
inbullet format and usuallyin incomplete sentences,similar tohow onemight take
notes from a lecture.The purpose of this writing style was to present information as
concisely as possible for quick reference.This also allowed us to present the book in a
manageablesizeand atareasonablecost.
KEYFEATURES
In most cases,colorimages emphasizing themajor diagnostic feature of the disease are
presented.Thekey diagnostic feature itself,where applicable,is highlighted in blue in
thetext.Where there are a number of drugs involved in treating the disease,thedosage,
route of administration,and therapylength are presented in table format for quick ref-
erence.A short list of Suggested Readings at the end of each chapter offers the reader
the current or most important references for the topic.This reference list is by no
meansexhaustive
APPENDICES
Appendices,including corevaccination schedules,antiparasitic products for the treat-
ment of gastrointestinal parasites in dogs,parasiticides forcats,canine heartworm pre-
ventives,and canine products with efficacy against arthropods,have been included.A
drugformulary extractedfromThe5-MinuteVeterinary Consult:Canineand Feline,third
edition,with emphasis on those agents used against infectious and parasitic diseases,is
provided.Several new drugs,particularlyinregard to those used in treating parasitic
infections,have alsobeen added.

Amebiasis
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
Facultative parasitic ameba that infectspeople and non-human primates (including
dogsand cats)
Foundprimarily in tropical areas throughout theworld,although still occurs in
NorthAmerica.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Entamoeba histolytica—dogs and cats become infected by ingesting cysts from
humanfeces.
Encystment of trophozoitesseldomoccursindogs orcatsso theyarenot asource
of infection.
Oneof thefeworganisms transmitted frommantopetsbutrarely frompetstoman.
Trophozoites(the pathogenic stage)--inhabit thecoloniclumen as commensals or
invade the colonic wall,but can disseminate to other organs(rare） including lungs,
liver,brain,and skin.
Trophozoites damage intestinal epithelial cells by secreting enzymesthat lyse cells
anddisruptintercellularconnections.
Certainbacteria andadiet deficient in proteinincrease thevirulenceof the ameba.
The host's immune response to invasion exacerbates pathology.
Coloniculceration results when trophozoitesin the submucosa undermine the
mucosa.
Acanthamoeba castellani and A.culbertsoni—free-livingspeciesfound infreshwater,
saltwater,soil,and sewage;can infect dogs.
Acanthamoebaspp.—infection thought tobebyinhalation oforganismsfromcon-
taminatedwater or colonization of theskin or cornea;hematogenous spread or
directspread from thenasalcavity through thecribiformplateto the centralnerv-
oussystemmay occur resultinginagranulomatous amebicmeningoencephalitis.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
Mainly young and/or immunosuppressed animals are infected.

CLINICALFEATURES
Dogs
E.histolytica infectionsareusuallyasymptomatic
Severe infections-result inulcerativecolitis tocause dysentery (maybefatal)
Hematogenous spread-results in failure states of the organs(invariablyfatal).
Granulomatous amebicmeningoencephalitis(caused byAcanthamoeba spp.)—caus-
essignssimilartodistmpr（anrexiaever,lhargy,oculonasaldisharge,r
ratory distress,and diffuse neurologic abnormalities).
Syndromeof inappropriatesecretion of antidiuretichormonehasbeenreported in a

invasion ofthehypothalamus.
Cats
Colitis-causingchronicintractable diarrhea (similar to dogs)
Systemic amebiasis-notbeenreported in thecat.
Acanthamoeba-not beenreported in the cat.
DIFFERENTIALDIAGNOSIS
Dogs
Causesofbloody diarrhea or tenesmus including:constipation;foodintolerance/
allergy;parasitism （whip worms,Leishmaniasis,Balantidiasis);HGE;foreign body；
irritable bowel syndrome;inflammatory bowel disease;diverticula;infectious (par-
voviruslostridialntritsbactrialvrgrowthandothrbactrialcausesungl
such as histoplasmosis or blastomycosis);neoplasia;ulcerative colitis;endocrinopa-
thy (Addison’s disease);toxic (lead,fungal,or plant）;occasionally major organ
disease causing colonic ulceration such asrenal failure.
Other causes of diffuse neurologicdisease inyoung animals including:Infectious
（distemper,fungal such as Cryptococcus,Blastomyces,Histoplasma,bacterial,pro
tozoal such asToxoplasma and Neospora);toxic(lead,organophosphate);trauma;
GME:extracranial (hypoglycemia;hepatic encephalopathy);inherited epilepsy;
neoplasia.
Cats
Other causes ofdiarrhea including:food intolerance/allergy:inflammatory bowel
disease;parasitism (giardiasis,parasites such as hookworms,roundworms,tritri-
chomonas);infectious （panleukopenia,FIV,FeLV producing panleukopenia-like
syndrome,bacterial including Salmonella,rarely Campylobacter):drug(acetamino-
phen);neoplasia;pancreatitis;and major organ dysfunction

THE5-MINUTEVETERINARYCONSULT CLINICALCOMPANION
Drugs of Choice
Metronidazole(20mg/kg,PO,ql2h,for7 days)
Precautions/lnteractions
High doses of metronidazole(usually>30 mg/kg)for extended periodsmay cause
neurologic signs in dogs.
COMMENTS
Dogs and cats are an unlikely source of infection in people.
Pets usually acquire infections from the same source as their owners;veterinarians
must warn owners of possible risk.
■People and pets are at risk of exposure to free-living amebiasis from the same
environmentalsources.
■Immunocompetency often determines whetherinfectionwill become established.

AnaerobicInfections
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
Caused by bacteria that require low oxygen tension,and elaborate toxins and
enzymesleadingto extensionof theinfection into adjacenthealthytissue.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Most common genera—Bacteroides,Fusobacterium,Actinomyces,Clostridium,and
Peptostreptococcus.
Pathogenesis determined by thebody systeminvolved.
Body areas involved-usually thosenear amucosal surface.

Topical therapy—clotrimazole infused into the nasal and sinus cavities for1 hour
under general anesthesia is method of choice (although some still prefer enil-
conazole).
MethodofNasalAntifungal Therapy
Prepare patient—general anesthesia with well-fitting cuffed endotracheal tube in
place.
■Occlude caudal nares by placement of an appropriate-sized Foley catheter (24
French for average-sized dog)in caudal nasopharynx dorsal to soft palate.
Author prefers using 2X2 gauze sponges held in place by monofilament nylon
threadplacedasfollows:
·Pass the tip of a 1-meter length of nylon suture(no.3SupramidExtra Il) into
the holes of a RRF tube (8 French,16inch),which acts as a carrier for the
nylon suturematerial.
·Pass the RRF tube into the nares on the medioventral floor of the nasal cavity
until it can be visualized using a laryngoscope in the oropharynx.
·Snare the nylon suture with forceps and pull out through the mouth; there is
now nylon thread passing from the nares,around the soft palate,and out the
mouth.
·In the center of the nylon thread, tie two 2 × 2 dry gauze sponges and pull
them back into the nasophaynx until they arefirmly lodged.They are held in
place by clamping the nylon thread extending out of the nares in place.
·The nylon thread exiting the mouth is used to pull the gauze sponges out of
the nasopharynx once theprocedureis completed.
·The back of the pharynx may be packed with more gauze sponges (to catch
leaks)tiedtogetherwithnylon threadthatprotrudesfrom themouthforeasy
retrieval.
Lavage both nasal cavities (via a 10 French RRF tube)—use warmed saline (some-
and mildly irritate nasal mucosa.
Drain wellair can begentlyblown into the nares to dry.
■Place dog in dorsal recumbancy with the nasal opening uppermost (pointing to the
ceiling).
■Fillnasalcavitiesandsinuseswithclotrimazole solutionandmaintainfullfor
1 hour.
Average dog requires50 to 60ml clotrimazolefor each side.
■Once the nasal cavity is full, obstruct the nostril (usingFoley catheters—l2French,
dental swabs,or tampons)and rotate thehead toimprove the distribution of the
clotrimazole to all nasal and sinus surfaces.
Once treatment completed,after1hour drain clotrimazoleby placing the patient in
sternal recumbency,open nares to allow solution to drain rostrally,and irrigate with
saline toensureno clotrimazoleremains tobeswallowedwhen the dogwakes
Remove pharyngeal and nasopharyngeal gauzes through themouth and ensure that
no clotrimazole is left in the pharynx or nasopharynx.
Treat pharyngeal or laryngeal irritationpostrecovery—one dose of corticosteroids
(prednisone0.5mg/kg).
■More than one treatmentmay berequired.

Babesiosis
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
A protozoal disease (genus Babesia)of dogs and cats in which merozoites
(piroplasms)infect RBCs.
Degreeofillnessusuallydependentontheseverityandrateofanemiadevelopment.
Anemia mainly asaresultofimmune-mediatedhemolysisbutalso dueto direct
piroplasm damage toRBCs.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Infection(by ticktransmission,transplacental,orbyblood transfusion)followed by
2-weekincubation period duringwhich piroplasms infect andmultiply inRBCs
resultinginRBCdamagemainlyfrom immune-mediatedprocessesbut also direct
RBC lysis.
Dogs
Large（4to7μm).
B.canis distributed worldwide;three subspecies based on biologic,genetic,and
geographic distribution.
·B.canis vogeli-United States,Africa,Asia,Australia.
B.canis rossi-Africa(most virulent subspecies).
·B.canis canis-Europe,areas of Asia.
Small (2 to5μm);three genetically distinct subspecies.
·B.gibsoniworldwide distribution(especiallyAsia),but an emergingdisease
in the United States.
·B.gibsoni （California:genetically distinct form）—infects only dogs and

SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
History of tick attachment.
■History of recent dogbite wound may be a risk forB.gibsoni (Asia) infection.
■Any age or breed of dog can be infected.
Severity of disease-depends on the strain of the organism and the age and breed of
the animal.
B.canis infections—more prevalent in greyhounds (United States).
B.gibsoni (Asia)infections—more prevalent in American pit bull terriers (United
States).
■Southern Asia and Africa—any age or breed dog or cat can be infected.
United States-cats often infected witha closely related organism(Cytauxzoonfelis)
CLINICALFEATURES
Dogs
Peracute,acute,chronic,or asymptomatic（in some carrier animals)
Splenectomy and immunosuppression—severely worsen disease (B. canis rossi)or
makes it apparent (B. canis in the United States).
Immunosuppressionmay result in an increase in parasitemia and manifestation of
clinical signs in chronically infected dogs (B.canis in the United States).
■Most severe disease—caused by B.gibsoni in the United States and B. canis rossi in
Africa.
B.canis-rarely causes clinical disease in the United States.
Signs include the following:
.Lethargy.
·Anorexia.
·Weight loss.
·Palemucous membranes (Fig.6-1).
·Fever.
·Splenomegaly.
·Lymphadenopathy.
·Hemoglobinemia/uria.
·Icterus (Fig. 6-2).
·GI signs-
some dogs develop vomiting.diarrhea,darkfeces(from increased
bilirubin excretion).
·Cerebral babesiosis—weakness, disorientation,collapse (B. canis rossi in
Africa).
·Renal/urologic disease-—results in renal failure (B.canis rossi in Africa)

Bartonellosis
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
Anintracellular bacterial infection of cats and dogs-various bacterial species cause
differentsyndromesfrom bacteremiaincats toendocarditisindogs.
Human syndromes-includesCSD(regional lymphadenopathy aftera cat scratch),
bacillarypeliosis,bacillary angiomatosis,relapsingfeverwithbacteremia,encephali
tis,meningitis,neuroretinitis,and endocarditis.
Distribution-worldwide.
Estimated25,000 human casesperyear in theUnitedStatesbut fewfatalities.
Seasonalinhumancases-mostreportedinsummermonths.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Fastidioushemotropicgram-negativerodbacterium
Bartonella is thought toinvade and multiplywithinRBCs.
At least oneBartonella species(andprobably others)produces a factor that causes
vascular endothelial proliferation,a feature of human syndromes-bacillary
angiomatosisbacillary splenicpeliosis,andpeliosishepatis.
Cats
Infectedwith four Bartonella species--B.henselae,B.clarridgeiae,B.koehlerae,and
B.bovis.
10%ofcatswith Bartonella bacteremia—due toB.clarridgeiae.
B.koehleraeandB.bovis-only a few casereports.
Mixed infections—of B.henselae（which contains at least two subgroups）and
B.clarridgeiae occur.
Transmission—via cat fleas (Ctenocephalides felis felis),but exact role not yet
determined.

Dogs
Infected with four Bartonella species-B.vinsoni subsp.berkhoffi,B.henselae,
B.clarridgeiae,and B.elizabethae.
Ticks and fleas-may be vectors for transmission of B.vinsonii subsp.berkhoffi to
dogs.
B.vinsonii subsp. berkhoffiexperimentally, causes no clinical signs but mild
immunosuppression and persistent bacteremias(up to247 days).
Natural cases-rare disease caused by B.henselae (peliosis hepatis) and B.vinsonii
subsp. berkhoffii (endocarditis,granulomatous rhinitis,and granulomatous
lymphadenitis).
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
Cats
Seroprevalence highest for B.henselae-worldwide occurrence.
Highest seroprevalencein warm humid climates,older cats,and those most
exposed tofleas.
Prevalence ofbacteremiaincats in theUnited States—5%to40%(highestinwarm
humid climates).
Flea infestation-appears to be necessary for the transmission of B.henselae from
cats tohumans,but direct transmission tohumansviaaflea bite isspeculative.
Until recently-was not thought to cause disease in the cat.
Dogs
Seroprevalence of B.henselae—approximately3% to9% in theUnitedStates.
to75%,suggesting they may be the reservoir host for this species.
Endocarditis cases-variable,but often include weight loss,syncope,collapse,and
sudden death.
Hepatic disease-depression,weight loss,andvomiting.
CLINICALFEATURES
Cats
In natural cases-clinical signs are rare and include uveitis and possibly lym-
phadenopathy.
In experimentally infected catsmost remained asymptomatic for over a year,in
spite ofpersistent infection.
After intradermal inoculation of B.henselae—develop abscess at inoculation site,
lymphadenomegaly,periodic fever,and mild neurologic signs(nystagmus,whole
body tremors,focal motor seizures,and behavior changes).
Histologic lesionsinclude peripheral lymph node hyperplasia, splenic follicular
hyperplasia,lymphocytic cholangitis/pericholangitis,lymphocytic hepatitis,
lymphoplasmacyticmyocarditis,andinterstitial lymphocyticnephritis.

Humans
Erythematous papule atinoculation site(scratch,bite)—then unilateralregional
lymphadenopathy (painful,often suppurative) in 3to10 days(>90%of cases).
Symptoms—mild fever,chills(infrequent),anorexia,myalgia,and nausea.
Atypical manifestations（usuallyin immunosuppressedpatients,in up to 25%of
cases)—encephalopathy(1%to7%),palpebralconjunctivitis(3%to5%),meningitis,
osteolyticlesions,granulomatoushepztitis,andpneumonia.

Blastomycosis
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
Asystemicmycoticinfection affectingdogs,and rarelycats,most commonlyin the
Mississippi,Ohio,and Tennessee River basins.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Blastomycesdermatitidis-small soilfungus.
Small spores（conidia)—shed from the mycelial phase of the organism growing in
soil.
Conidia--inhaled and enter the terminal airway.
Atbodytemperature-sporesbecomeyeast,whichinitiatelunginfection.
From this focus ofmycotic pneumonia-yeast disseminates hematogenously
throughoutthebody.
The immuneresponse totheinvadingorganism—pyogranulomatousinfiltrateto

Of affected dogs-85%havelung disease.
Eyes,skin,lymphatic system,and bones-commonly affected.
CNS,testes,prostate,mammary gland,nasal cavity,gums,and vulvaless com-
monly affected.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
Historically,mostcommonlyreported complaints:
·Weight loss.
·Depressed appetite.

CLINICALFEATURES
Dogs
Feverup to104°F（40°C)—approximately50%ofpatients
■Harsh,dry lung sounds associated with increased respiratory effort-common
■Generalized or regional lymphadenopathywith or without skin lesions.
Uveitis-with or without secondary glaucoma and conjunctivitis,ocular exudates,
cornealedema,retinal granulomas.
Lameness-commonbecauseoffungal osteomyelitis
■Testicular enlargement and prostatomegalyoccasionally seen.
Cats
Increased respiratory effort.
Granulomatous skinlesions.
DIFFERENTIALDIAGNOSIS
Respiratory signsa general differential diagnosis for respiratory signs and cough
includes such categories as:
·Cardiovascular (pulmonary edema;enlarged heart,especially theleft atrium;
pleural effusion; pulmonary emboli).
Allergic (bronchial asthma,chronic bronchitis,eosinophilic pneumonia,or
granulomatosis,pulmonary infiltrate with eosinophilia).
Trauma (foreign body, irritating gases, collapsing trachea).
Neoplasia (not only of the respiratory treebut also associated structures such
as ribs,lymph nodes,muscles).
·Inflammatory (pharyngitis; tonsillitis; kennel cough from such agents as
Bordetella bronchiseptica, parainfluenza virus,infectious laryngotracheitis
virus,and mycoplasma;bacterial bronchopneumonia;chronic pulmonary
fibrosis; pulmonary abscess or granuloma; chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease).
·Parasites (Oslerus[Filaroides]osleri,Crenosoma vulpis,Capillaria aerophila,F.
milksi,Paragonimus kellicotti,Dirofilaria immitis--heartworm disease).
Lymph node enlargement-similar to lymphosarcoma; differentiated by lymph node
aspirate cytologic examination.
Combination offeverandrespiratory diseasewitheye,bone,orskininvolvementin
a young dog—suggests the diagnosis.

DIAGNOSTICS
CBC-changesreflectmild tomoderate inflammation (neutrophilicleukocytosis±
left shift,monocytosis).
High serum globulins with borderline low albumin concentrations-dogswith
chronicinfections.
Hypercalcemia-in some dogs,secondary to the granulomatous changes.
Blastomycesyeasts-canbefound in the urine of dogswith prostaticinvolvement.
AGID-useful formakinga diagnosisiforganismscannotbefoundon cytologicor
histopathologicexamination.
Positive AGID—strongly supports diagnosis.with a specificity of >90%,but in
endemic areas,dogs can be positive but not have disease.
NegativeAGID-commonin dogswith earlyinfection.
Radiographic findings-lungs usually show generalized interstitial-to-nodular infil-
trates(Fig.9-1)with tracheobronchial lymphadenopathy(common).
Chestradiographic findings-inconsistent withbacterial pneumonia butmust be
differentiatedfrom metastaticneoplasia(especiallyhemangiosarcoma).

THES-MINUTEVETERINARYCONSULT CLINICALCOMPANION
Teratogenic effects ofitraconazole-nonereported at therapeutic doses inrats and
mice;embryotoxicity found at high doses;no dog or cat studies;one dog started on
itraconazole halfway through her pregnancy delivered a normal litter.
COMMENTS
Inform owner-treatment is costly and requires a minimum of 60 to 90 days.
Determine duration of treatment—based on resolution of clinical signs and follow
up chest radiographs.
Considerablepermanent lung changes-may occur after the infection has resolved,
making determination of persistent active disease difficult.
At 60 days of treatment—if active lung disease is seen,continue treatment for 30
days.
At90 days of treatment—if condition is the same as at day 60,changes areresidual.
Fibrosis on radiographs-inactive disease;if condition is better than at day 60,con-
tinue treatment for30more days;if lesions aresignificantlyworse than at 60 days,
change treatment to amphotericinB and then obtain anotherradiograph.
At120 days of treatment-obtain anotherradiograph;continue treatment aslong as
there is improvement in thelungs;if there is no further improvement and no indi
cation of active disease,the lesions are probably scarring.
Prognosis—death;25% of dogs die during the first week of treatment;early diagno-
sisimproveschance of survival.
■Severity of lung involvement and invasion into the CNS affect prognosis.
■Recurrenceabout20%of dogs:usuallywithin3 to6months after completion of
treatment, even with 60 to 90 days of treatment; may occur up to 15 months after
treatment; a second course ofitraconazole treatment will cure most patients;drug
resistance toitraconazolehasnotbeen observed.
wounds; inoculation of organisms from dog biteshas occurred.
Caution-avoid cuts during necropsy ofinfected dogs;avoid needle sticks when
aspirating lesions.
■Warn clients—-blastomycosis is acquired from an environmental source and that
they may have been exposed at the same time as the patient; common source expo-
sure has been documented in duck and raccoon hunters; the incidence in dogs is 10
times that in humans;encourage clients with respiratory and skin lesions to inform
their physicians--theymay have been exposed toblastomycosis.

Occasionallygrowsinother tissues（intervertebral disks,anterioruveameninges）
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
Mostcommon inbeagle dogs,but noknowngeneticpredisposition.
Overallprevalence unknown.
Highest in dogs from rural areas(particularlyof the southern states）,and certain
kennels(Labrador retrievers over represented).
Also high in stray dogs (strays inMexicohave a 25%to30% seroprevalence).
Petsare occasionally affected.
No age preference,but it ismore common in sexually mature dogs.
Femalesare more commonly affected thanmales.

Serology-three main tests(all susceptibleto error):
·RSAT—commercially available;becomespositive3to4weekspostinfection;
rapid andvery good at identifying truenegative status;highrate offalse posi-
tiveresults (50%),so positive results must be confirmed by other tests.
·Mercaptoethanoltube agglutination testsemiquantitative test;similar to
RSAT in its lack of specificity.
·AGID—highly sensitive （ifuses cell wall lipopolysaccharide antigen of B.
canis),but can give false positive results n negative dogs;if soluble antigens
（extractedfrombacterial cytoplasm)areused,test ishighly specificfor anti-
bodiesagainstother Brucella spp.（B.suis,B.abortus）that infect dogs;maygive

Canine Distemper
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
Aviral infection of dogscausingacutetosubacutefebrile andoften fatal diseasewith
respiratory,Gl,and CNSmanifestations.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Morbillivirus(in theParamyxoviridae family)affectsmany different speciesof the
order Carnivora.
Mortalityrate—varies greatly among species.
Natural route of infection-airborne and droplet exposure.
Nasal cavity,pharynx,and lungs-macrophages carry the virus from these
structures to local lymph nodes,wherevirus replication occurs.
Within1weekpostinfection—virtually all lymphatictissuesbecome infected.
Spreadsviaviremiato surfaceepithelium of respiratory,Gl,and urogenital tracts
and to theCNS.
Fever（for1to2days)and lymphopenia-maybe theonly findings duringinitial
period.
Further development ofdisease-depends on the virus strain and the immune
response.
Strong cellular and humoral immune response—mayremain subclinical.
Weakimmuneresponse-subacute infection;may survivelonger.
Failureofimmuneresponse-deathwithin2to4weekspostinfection.
Seizures and other CNSdisturbances-frequent causesof death.
Affectsall lymphatictissues;surfaceepithelium in therespiratory,alimentary,and

CLINICAL FEATURES
Fever,first peak3 to6days postinfection,may pass unnoticed.
Fever,second peak-several days later (and intermittent thereafter);usually
associatedwith nasal and ocular discharge,depression,and anorexia.
Fever followed by Gl and/or respiratory signs-often enhanced by secondary
bacterial infection.
CNSmany infected dogs;often,butnot always,after systemic disease;dependson

CNS presentation—either acute gray matter disease(seizures and myoclonuswith
depression）orsubacutewhitematterdisease(incoordinationataxiaparesis,paraly-
sis,and muscle tremors).
Meningeal signs of hyperesthesia and cervical rigidity-maybe seen in both.
Opticneuritis andretinal lesions-notuncommon;sometimesinjectedscleral blood

Enamel hypoplasiaof theteeth afterneonatal infection-common.
In utero infection of fetuses in antibody-negative bitchesrare.
Maylead to abortion orpersistent infection—infectedneonatesmay develop fatal
disease by4 to6weeks of age.
DIFFERENTIALDIAGNOSIS
Consider—in anyyoung,unvaccinated dogwith multifocal CNS diseaseand other
organ involvement.
Kennel cough-distemper can mimic therespiratory disease in young pups.
Enteric signs—differentiate from CPV and CCV infections,parasitism (giardiasis,
hookwormsroundworms）,bacterialinfections,gastroenteritisfromtoxiningestion,

may see false positive titers if CSF is contaminated by blood during collection
process or if a bleed into the CNS has occurred.
■To avoid false positive CSF antibody results—compare ratio of CDV antibody titer
in CSF to serum;if .1 in association with consistent clinical signs, strongly indica-
tive of distemper encephalitis.
To increase predictive value of this ratio comparison even furthercompare ratio
to corresponding CSF/serum antibody ratio for another infectious agent against
which the dog has been vaccinated (e.g.,CPV or CAV); if CDV is greater, the only
way elevation can occur is by the presence of distemper encephalitis.
Vaccination or CDV infection without CNS involvementwill not increase CDV
antibody titers in CSF
Viral antigen or viral inclusions-in buffy coat cells and conjunctival or vaginal
imprints; negative results do not rule out the diagnosis.

CSF—test for cell and protein content,CDV-specific antibody,interferon,andviral
antigen early in disease course.
Tissue immunofluorescence and/or immunocytochemistry，virus isolation,and/or
PCR—preferred tissues from lungs, stomach,urinary bladder, lymph nodes, and
brain.
■Virus may persist in skin for up to 60 days postinfection-PCR and
immunocytochemistry may help in identifying CDV in skin biopsies;high falseneg
ativerate.
THERAPEUTICS
Inpatients and in isolation-toprevent infection of other dogs.
■Symptomatic nursing care—including intravenous fluids (with anorexia and diar-
rhea) or parenteral nutrition.
Once fever and secondarybacterial infections are controlled—patients usuallybegin
to eat again.
Drugs of Choice
■Antiviral drugs-none known to be effective.
Antibiotics-to reduce secondary bacterial infection,because CDV is highly
immunosuppressive.
Anticonvulsant therapy—phenobarbital, potassium bromide; to control myoclonus
and seizures.
Vaccination—MLV-CD—prevents infection and disease.
■Two types of MLV-CD available:
·Canine tissue culture-adapted vaccines (e.g., Rockborn strain)—induce

Infection
Arare systemic viral disease(although thevirus is common in nature)affects pup-
pies<3weeks of age,resulting in highmortality.
Other canine speciessusceptible-wolves and coyotes.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Canine herpesvirus-often found latent in several tissues,including the trigeminal
nerveganglia.
Virusmaybe excreted innasal secretions inresponse to stress or corticosteroid
use.
Poor regulation ofbody temperature andimmatureimmuneresponse
mechanismsprobably result in susceptibility of young puppies.
Clinical diseasevery rare in pups>3weeks of age——all organ systems involved.
Pups-acquire infection as they pass through vagina during birth in an infected
bitch.
Mature nonpregnant dogs-often have subclinical infections(nasopharynx and
externalgenitalia).
Transplacentalinfectionsduringlast3to4weeksofgestation-canresultinfetal
deaths,often with mummification;abortions;birth of dead or dying pups.
Localizedgenital infection-occurs inbothsexes.

CanineLungworm
(Crenosoma)
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
A helminth parasite usually of foxes,wolves,and raccoons,but can invade the
bronchointerstitial pattern on thoracicradiographs.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Crenosomavulpis-ametastrongyloidaeparasite.
Eggs andLl larvae—arelaid in therespiratory treeof infected dogs,ascend the
trachea,and are swallowed back into the Gl tract andpassed in the feces.
L1 larvae—infect snails and slugs,where they develop toL3larvae.
Dogs-become infected by eatinginfected mollusks or smallamphibians and
reptiles,which may serve as paratenic hosts.
PPP=19days.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
Affects dogs of all ages.
Usuallyahistoryof unusual exposure to outdoors such asmight occur with a
suburban dogvisitingaruralregionfor aperiod of time.
Infected dogs usually present duringmid to late summer.
Highprevalence amongst dogs onPrinceEdward Island,Canada.
CLINICALFEATURES
Productive cough that isunresponsive to antibiotics.
Coughdevelopsapproximately2to3weeksafterlikelyexposuretoparasite
Cough easily elicited on tracheal palpation（unlike cough caused by Oslerus
[Filaroides]osleri).

changes forF.hirthi,C.vulpis,and F.milksi can be similar,but theLl of F.milksi
has a kinked tail;the other two do not.Differentiating F.hirthi and C.vulpis is
difficult and requires comparing Ll larval differences:F.hirthi organisms have
blunt,roundedoral ends,whereas C.vulpisorganisms havebluntlyconicaloralends
and a straight-sided,more gradually tapering cone than that of F.hirthi.From a

parasites in a transtracheal wash(Fig.18-1).
Transtracheal wash usually contains Ll larvae （some Ll larvae are in eggs),
eosinophils,some neutrophils.

■If infected dogs are in contact with others-all dogs should be treated to attempt to
break the horizontal transmission cycle.
■Feces from all dogs-should be screened using ZSCT; all dogs with positive test
results should be isolated and treated.
■In a colony of experimental dogs—rigorous attempts must be made to clear the
infectionbecauselungwormlesionscan lead tospuriousresultsin drug toxicologic

Canine Parvovirus
Infection
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
Viral infection causing systemicillness with primarily Gl and immunologic effects
inyoung dogs（6to16weeksof age)andoccasionally cats.
Clinically characterized by anorexia;vomiting:bloody,watery diarrhea;and sepsis
asaresult of absoluteneutropenia.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
CPVs are small,nonenveloped single-strandedDNAviruses;two are pathogenicto
dogs—CPV-1(minutevirus ofcanines)and CPV-2(causing Gl tract disease).
CPV-1—uncertain pathogenicity;has been associated with “fading puppy
syndrome;causeslethargy,loose stools,respiratory distress,and sudden deathn
1-to3-day-old pups.
CPV-2—first appearedin1977;known simplyascanine parvovirus andisclosely
related tofelinepanleukopeniavirusandmink enteritisvirus.
Current isolates（CPV-2a appeared in1980,and CPV-2bin1984)different antigenic
structures,increasedpathogenicity,andshorterincubationperiod（4to5daysversus
5to8days)compared toCPV-2.
CPV-2aand2balsoreplicateincats.
Vaccinesmade against the original CPV-2—protect against all 2a and 2b.
Route ofinfectionfecaloral followed byviralreplication in tonsilar lymphoid
tissueinitially.with subsequent spread to other lymphoid tissue(bone marrow,
mesenteric nodes,thymus).
Viremiaoccursbyday3to5postinfection andprecedesclinical signs-viruscanbe
detectedinintestinal epithelialcellsby day4postinfection.
Fecal shedding-occurs soon afterviremia,with large amountsofvirus excreted in
feces in clinically affected dogs.
Fecal shedding—usually lasts nolonger than day12postinfection.
CPV targets rapidly dividing cells in the intestine (crypt cells of distal duodenum
and jejunum),bone marrow,and,under exceptional circumstances,myocardial
tissue.
66
100THE5-MINUTEVETERINARYCONSULTCLINICALCOMPANION
Enteritis
■Commonly seen in pups 6 to 16 weeks of age.
Dividing crypt cells are killed; enteric cells moving up the villus to be lost into the
intestinal lumen are not replaced by new cells; leads to denuded villus.
Takes about 2 weeks for complete villus repair to occur.
Virtually all clinical signs are as a consequence of crypt cell and lymphoid/bone mar-
rowdestruction
Severe cases developsepsisand endotoxemia fromgram-negative entericbacteria
(CPV infection alone in gnotobiotic dogs produces minimal signs).
Sepsis causes circulatory collapse,multiple organ failure,and death.
BoneMarrow
CPVcausesnecrolysisofbothmyeloid anderythroidstemcellsinmarrow-because
RBCs have long half-lives (approximately 120 days),few effects are seen on the RBC
indices,although anemia may occur as a result of blood loss from thebowel.
Leukocyte counts reflect both peripheral consumption and myeloid destruction—
with markedreductionbeginning from day3 to5postinfection.
■Myeloid destruction with profound reductionsinWBCcounts—occurs with,orjust
after,the onset of clinical signs (day 6postinfection).
■In recovery—a left shift (appearance of band neutrophils) with rebound neutro-
philiaoftenpredictsasuccessfultreatmentoutcome.
Myocardial Disease
Cardiac myocytes can only support CPV growth in first 2 weeks of puppieslife,so
must beinfected inuteroorwithin first weeks of lifepuppieswith any degree of
passive immunity from dam(today virtually100%)are immune and will not become
infected (syndrome rarely seen today,but was common in late1970s).
Although viral damage occurs in first 2weeks—myocarditis not seenuntil pups are
6to8weeksofage;causesacutedeath.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
Young dogs—usually between 6 and 16 weeks of age.
Certain dog breedsrottweilers,Doberman inschers,pit bull terriers,German shep-
herds,English springer spaniels,Alaskan sled dogs,and perhaps Labrador retrievers
seemmore predisposed (more severe infection and can beinfected as adults).
■Cats-canbeinfectedwith CPV2a and 2b and showclinical signs similar to those
seen in dogs, but this is rare.
CLINICALFEATURES
Can be extremely variable depending on age,immunity, copathogens (parasites or
entericbacteria),and infective dose.
Crowding and poor sanitation reduce the chances of successful response to immu-
nization in kennels.

All causes of diarrhea,including systemic ormetabolic disease,as well as specific
intestinal disorders,should beconsidered,although those affectingpuppies should
receive a higher priority.
Othercausesofacuteenteritis:dietaryindiscretion,foreignbody,IBD,HGE,intus
susception,drugs （antibiotics);toxins (lead）,parasites （roundworms,cryp-
tosporidiosis,giardiasis,coccidiosis,whipworms),infectious agents（salmonellosis,
Campylobacter spp.,Gl tract bacterial overgrowth,clostridiosis,coronavirus),sys-
temicorgan dysfunction（renal,hepatic,pancreatic),metabolic（hypoadrenocorti-
cism),andneoplasia(Gl tract lymphoma or adenocarcinoma) inolder dogs.

THERAPEUTICS
Intensive therapywith hospitalizationsignificantly improves survival.
Isolate from otherpatients-affectedpatients excrete large amounts ofvirus.
■Puppies that are notvomiting and not significantly dehydrated—treat on an out-
patient basis.
Intravenous crystalloid fluid therapy ismainstay of therapyaccount for dehydration
and ongoing lossesfromvomiting and diarrhea.
Avoid subcutaneous fluid administration inneutropenicpatients to avoid abscess
formation.
Extreme care in catheter maintenance should be takena high proportion (up to
22%)of CPVpatients developbacterial colonization of IV catheters
Colloid therapymaybe useful inpatientswithhypoalbuminemiawholeblood and
plasma may also be used if blood loss in diarrhea is severe.
Withhold waterand food until vomiting has abated—initiate small amounts of water
after24hourswithnovomiting.
Enteral nutrition via a nasogastric feeding tube soon after admission—improves
morbidity,time to recovery,and survivability of CPV-affected dogs.
Glutamine supplementation--improvesenterocytehealth.
When ready to initiate fooduse a bland diet (Hill's i/d,Purina EN),with gradual
transition tonormaldiet
Drugs of Choice
Antiemetics—-use if vomitingprotracted.Metoclopramide or the serotonin receptor
antagonist ondansetron are prefered. Phenothiazines (promethazine, chlorpro-
mazine)may worsen lethargy and hypotension.
Hblockers (famotidine)—may reduce nausea.
Antibiotics--to prevent and treat sepsis; use broad-spectrum agents to include gram-
negative organisms;ampicillin,cefazolin,ceftiofur,sometimesin combination with
gentamicin (unless patient is very young or dehydrated).
Anthelmintic therapy (fenbendazole)—for concurrent parasitism should be consid-
ered oncevomitinghas ceased.
Equine endotoxin antiserum,granulocyte colony-stimulating factor,TNF, corticos-
teroids,andNSAIDsdonot seem to improve survivability or recovery time.
Vaccination—MLV given at 6,9,12,and 16weeks of age.High-risk breeds may
require longerinitial period,extending out to 22weeks.
Mainreason forvaccine failure—interferencefrom maternal antibody.
Yearly booster vaccination-advised by most vaccine manufacturers,but dogs
probablyonlyrequireboostervaccinationevery3years.
Dogs acquire natural boostering throughout their lives from exposure to wild-
type CPV isolates in the environment—negates the need for regular booster
vaccination.

Canine Tracheal
Worm (oslerus)
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
Ahelminthparasitethatformsnoduleswithinthemucosa atthebifurcationof the
trachea of dogs.
Causes cough,respiratory distress,and eventually tracheal obstruction.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Oslerus(Filaroides)osleri-Metastrongyloideaparasite.
Adult parasites-live in fibrousnodules within the tracheal bifurcation
submucosa/mucosa;release eggs containing Ll larvae directly into the tracheal
lumen.
Lllarvae-are directlyinfective toother dogs(auniquefeature of theseparasites；
otherinfective larvaerequirefurther developmentbeforebecoming infective).
Dogs-acquireinfectiondirectlyfromLlinfecesfrominfecteddogsorwhenan
infected damregurgitatesfood.
Regurgitatedfood-becomescontaminatedwithLllarvaeas thefoodpasses over
theoropharynx.
Pups eatingregurgitated food become infected-a featuremore commonofwild
canids （wolves,coyotes,foxes,dingoes);may explain why infection is more
common inwild canids than in domesticdogs.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY

THE5-MINUTEVETERINARY CONSULT CLINICAL COMPANION
CLINICALFEATURES
■First signs-harsh cough (often exercise induced or in cold weather).
■Trachealpressure-usually does not elicit the cough,unlike other causes of
tracheobronchitis in the dog.
After coughing several times-dog often retches a brown phlegm,which is usually
swallowed.
Advanced and severe stagesof disease-the tracheabecomes so obstructedwithnod-
ules that harsh wheezes can be auscultated over the hilarregion,especially on expi
ration (Fig. 21-1).
■Tachypnea.
Increased inspiratory effort.
Prolonged expiration.
DIFFERENTIALDIAGNOSIS
A general differential diagnosis for cough includes such categories as:
·Cardiovascular (pulmonary edema;enlarged heart,especially the left atrium;
left-sided heart failure;pulmonary emboli).
·Allergic (bronchial asthma,eosinophilic pneumonia or granulomatosis,
pulmonaryinfiltratewitheosinophilia).
Trauma (foreignbody,irritating gases,collapsing trachea,hypoplastic trachea)
·Neoplasia (not only of the respiratory tree but also associated structures such
as ribs,lymph nodes)
·Inflammatory (pharyngitis;tonsillitis;kennel cough from such agents as
Bordetella bronchoseptica, parainfluenza virus,infectious laryngotracheitis
virus,and mycoplasma:bacterial bronchopneumonia;fungal pneumonia;
aspiration pneumonia;chronic pulmonary fibrosis;pulmonary abscess or
granuloma;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).
·Parasites(Capillariaaerophila,Filaroideshirthi,Crenosomavulpis,Paragonimus
kellicotti,Dirofilaria immitis-heartwormdisease).
The Ll ofall the canine lungworms (Filaroides hirthi,Oslerus[Filaroides]osleri
Crenosoma vulpis,and F.milksi） are very similar. Oslerus.(Filaroides) osleri is best
differentiated from the others by demonstrating nodules at the bifurcation of the
trachea; the tail has a small kink making it similar to F. milksi. Thoracic
radiographic changes for F.hirthi, C.vulpis,and F.milksi can be similar,but the
Ll of F.milksi has akinked tail and the othertwo donot.Differentiating F.hirthi
and C.vulpis is difficult,requiring comparing L1 larval differences: F.hirthi have
blunt,rounded oral ends,whereas C.vulpis have bluntly conical oral ends and a
straight-sided,more gradually tapering cone than F.hirthi.From a therapeutic
perspective, differentiation of these latter two is unimportant because they are
treatedsimilarly.

THERAPEUTICS
Medical treatment rarely produces a clinical cure.
In severe cases of acute myocarditis coupled with high parasitemia,prognosis is poor
andzoonoticriskhigher(to thosehandlingbloodproducts),so considereuthanasia.
■If dogs survive acute disease, progression to chronic stage tends to occur more
quickly (in about 1 to 2 years) in dogs diagnosed at a younger age (<2 years) than
dogs diagnosed at an olderage (>4years),which survive longer(3 to5years)
Treat cardiac failure and arrhythmias specifically.
Drugs of Choice

Cheyletiellosis
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
Ahighlycontagiousparasiticskiniseaseofogcatandrabbitscausedbyin
tation with Cheyletiella spp.mites.
Signs of scaling and pruritus can mimic other more common diseases.
Oftenreferred to as“walking dandruff,"because of thelarge mite size and excessive
scaling.
Prevalencevaries bygeographicregion owing tomite susceptibility to common flea-
controlinsecticides.
Human(zoonotic)lesionscanoccur.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Cheyletiella yasguri—dogs(Fig.23-1).
C.blakei-cats.
C.parasitivorax-rabbits.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
Dogs and cats.
More common in young animals.
Cocker spaniels,poodles,and long-haired catsarefrequent asymptomaticcarriers.
Catsmay exhibitbizarre behavioral signs or excessive grooming.
Pruritus-nonetosevere,depending on theindividual'sresponse toinfestation.
Infestationmaybesuspectedafterlesionsinhumanshavedeveloped.
Young animals and those in frequent contactwith others aremost at risk.
Common sources ofinfestation-animal shelters,breeders,andgrooming establish
ments.
CLINICALFEATURES
Scaling—most important clinical sign;diffuse orplaquelike;most severein chroni-
callyinfested and debilitated animals(Fig.23-2).

DIFFERENTIALDIAGNOSIS
Cheyletiellosisshould beconsidered in every animal that hasscaling,with orwith-
outpruritus.
Also consider-seborrhea,flea-allergic dermatitis,Sarcoptes spp.mite infestation,
atopy,foodhypersensitivity,and idiopathicpruritus.
DIAGNOSTICS
Examination ofepidermal debris-veryeffectivein diagnosinginfestation.
Collection of debris—flea combing（mosteffective)，skin scraping,and acetate tape
preparation.
Cheyletiella mites are large and can bevisualizedwitha simple handheld magnify
inglens;scales and hairmaybe examined under low magnification;stainingis not
necessary.
Response toinsecticidepreparationsmayberequired to definitivelydiagnosesuspi
cious cases in whichmites cannot beidentified.
THERAPEUTICS
Musttreatallanimalsinthehousehold.
Cliplongcoats to facilitate treatment.
Mainstay-6to 8weekly baths toremove scale,followedby rinses with an

Enterotoxicosis
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
Asyndrome characterizedby diarrheaindogsandcats associatedwiththeproduc-
tionofenterotoxinbynormalbacterialflorain theGl tract.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Clostridium perfringens-
—common enteric inhabitant generally foundin thevegeta-
tiveform livinginasymbioticrelationshipwith thehost.
Certain strains of C.perfringens(generally type A based onPCRanalysis)—produce
enterotoxin thatbindstotheentericmucosa,alterscellpermeability,andresultsn
celldamagewithsubsequentlocalenterocytedeath,butnosystemicillness.
C.perfringens enterotoxin-probably associated with enteric sporulation.
Enterotoxin production-anumber ofintrinsic host-related factors influence
enterotoxinproductionandpathogenicity of C.perfringens.
Pathogenicity of C.perfringens-may depend on the metabolic,mucosal,and
immunologic integrity of the GI tract.
IgA deficiency-possibly.
Alkaline intestinal luminal environment-promotes C.perfringens sporulation and
enterotoxinproduction.
Incidence—unknown.
Chroniclargebowel diarrhea—suspected that up to20%of casesof chronic large
bowel diarrhea in dogs are C.perfringens-related.
Cats-infection less common than in dogs.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
Most animals tend tobemiddle-aged or older.
No sex orbreedpredilections.
Historically，largebowel diarrhea with mucus.
Small amountsoffreshblood.

Coccidioidomycosis
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
A systemicmycoticinfection affecting dogs （usually4years old）and，rarely,cats.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Coccidioidesimmitis-growsseveral inches deep in the soil,whereit survives high
ambienttemperaturesandlowmoisture.
Afteraperiodofrainfallorganismreturns to thesoil surface,whereitsporulates,
releasingmany arthroconidia that aredisseminated bywindandduststorms.
Infection-byinhalation ofarthroconidia
Exposure to largedoses offungus incontaminated soil-associatedwith aggressive
nosing about in soil and underbrush;dust storms after rainy season;earthquakes;
land developments.

Asymptomaticinfections-mayoccur.
Skin lesions-usually associated with dissemination;penetrating wounds have
rarelybeen associatedwith skin lesions.
Signs ofdissemination-may notbe evident for several months after theinitial
infection.
Disseminationoccurolongbones,joints,eyes,skin,liver,kidneys,CNS,cardio-

THERAPEUTICS
Generally treated asoutpatients.
Concurrent clinical symptoms （e.g.,seizures,pain,coughing） should be treated
appropriately.
AnimalswithaCFtiter>l:8shouldbemonitored;ifarepeattitershowsarise after
4weeks,institute drug therapy.

Asper dogs,the azoles are preferred.
Precautions/lnteractions
Monitor-liver enzymelevels（risesinALT)monthlywhenusingazoles,especially
ketoconazole,for extended periods.
Ketoconazole-teratogenic,so should be used in pregnant animals only if the
potential benefit justifies the potential risk to offspring.
Amphotericin B—monitor for renal damage by frequent examination ofurine
sediment;discontinue treatment if granular casts arenoted in theurine;consider
lipid-encapsulated amphotericinBto decreasesideeffects.
Pulmonary diseaseresulting in severe coughing-may temporarily worsen after
therapyis begun,owing toinflammation in thelungs associated withkilling of
organisms.

Colibacillosis
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
Bacterial infection of dogs and cats causing arange of conditions,including sep-
ticemia in the veryyoung, sometimes complicating other causes of enteritis （par-
vovirus),UTI,and so on.
Canbe isolatedasnormal flora from the GI tract andprepuceandvagina of dogsand
cats.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Escherichia coli—gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae，normal inhabitant of the GI
tract of mostmammals.
Under certain circumstances(immunosuppression;presence ofother disease,such
asGI disease or otherpathogens)—can become systemic toaffect other organs or
contaminateother tissue/organ sites(urogenital system,skin,mammarygland).
Virulence factors（various,dependingon strains)exist—ability tocausesepticemia
probably duemore totheimmunestatusofhostrather thanvirulencefactors of
bacterium.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
Mainly affectsneonatal puppies and kittens<l weekof age—especially if they have
notreceived colostrum.
Predisposition-overpopulatedhousing.
Older dogs and cats-mainly diarrhea,urogenital (cystitis,endometritis,
pyelonephritis,prostatitis,mastitis),otitis,pneumonia,hepatobiliary disease,
endocarditis,and,rarely,meningoencephalomyelitis.

DIFFERENTIALDIAGNOSIS
Dietary indiscretion,IBD;neoplasia (especially Gl tract lymphoma);drugs(antibi-
otics);toxins(lead,organophosphates）;parasites(giardiasis,cryptosporidiosis,tri-
chomoniasis,whipworms);infectious agents(parvovirus,FIP,FeLV,salmonellosis,
rickettsia,Campylobacter,clostridia,histoplasmosis,coronavirus);systemic organ
dysfunction（renal,hepatic,pancreatic,cardiac,pyometra,peritonitis);metabolic
(hypoadrenocorticism).
DIAGNOSTICS

Cryptosporidiosis
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
A coccidian protozoa causing diarrhea in dogs and cats;also infects humans and
many othermammals,including calves,foals,rodents.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Multiple species occur—includingCryptosporidium canis and C.felis.
Morphologically-speciesvery similar.
Some speciesare host specific-others(e.g.,C.parvum)infect multiple species.
C.parvum-main species to infect small animals.
Infectionoccurs by ingestion of sporulated oocysts;sporozoites arereleased from
oocyststoinfectintestinalepithelial cells;multiply(asexually);merozoitesreleased
toinfectother cells.
PPP=5to10daysincats.
Immunocompetent animalsdevelop intestinal infection,which isusually asymp-
tomatic;excrete oocystsinfecesfor about 2weeks,then stop shedding.
Immunocompromised animalsusually have signs ofenteritis,but can develop
infectionsofrespiratorytract,liver,biliarytree,andpancreas

Cuterebriasis
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
A disease caused by the migration through tissues of the larvae of flies(genus
Cuterebra)in dogsand cats.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Cuterebra spp.are obligatory parasites of rodents and lagomorphs (rabbits).
Theflylayseggsonbladesof grass orin thehost'snest;theeggshatchand larvae
crawl onto theskin of a passinghost.
The smallmaggot enters a body orifice,migrates through various internal tissues
and,eventually,migrates to the skin whereit makesa warble.
These smallmaggots(3to5mm in length）are sometimes the parasite found to
cause clinical disease.
Once matured,the maggot (nowup to l inch long) drops out of the host to pupate
in the soil (Fig.31-1).
Cats and dogs infected in same way as other hosts.
Signs are associated with either the warble in the skin ormigration of thelarvae
throughtissus（naresuperreirary tract,kinof thface,culartissuebrai）.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
All ages and breeds of outdoor dogs andcatsmay be affected
Disease mainly seen duringmid to late summer (northern states）or nearly year
round (southern states)when flies are most active.
CLINICALFEATURES
Skin Warble
More common in dogsbut also cats.
Appears as a single draining 2-to5-mm cutaneous fistula (Fig.31-2).
Sometimes,abotwithprotrudingspiracles canbe seen withinthefistula
Before the bot penetrates the skin,the early developing warble can appear as a ten-
der l-cm swelling of the subcutis.

Cytauxzoonosis
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
Fatal tick-borne protozoal disease of domestic and feral cats(especially bobcats)
affecting thevascular system of the lungs,liver,spleen,kidneys,and brain,with
development stages in theRBCs.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Cytauxzoonfelis-distributed in the southcentraland southeasternUnitedStates
(Kansas and Oklahoma).
Large schizonts（tissue phase)-developin macrophages,causing them to line the
lumenofveins ofalmost every organ,leadingtoocclusion of thevessels(especially
in lungs).
DiC-oftenthefinaloutcome
Merozoites bud from the schizonts in macrophages-rupture cell to infect other
macrophagesandRBCs(1to3daysbefore death).
Vector-Dermacentorvariabilis,butprobably others alsoinvolved.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
No sex,age,or breed predisposition.
CLINICALFEATURES
Usuallyseveredebilitation atpresentation.
Anemia(beginning5to6dayspostinfection).
Depression.
Anorexia.
Dehydration.
High fever.

Demodicosis
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
An inflammatory parasitic disease of dogsand,rarely,cats thatischaracterized by
an increasednumberofmitesinthehairfollicles,which oftenleadstofurunculosis
andsecondarybacterialinfection.
Maybelocalized or generalized in dogs.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Dogs
Demodexcanis-amite;part of thenormal fauna of theskin:typicallypresentin small
numbers;residesin the hair follicles and sebaceous glands of the skin(Fig.33-1).
Pathology—develops when number ofmites exceed that tolerated by the immune
system.
Initial proliferationofmites-maybe theresultofa geneticor an immunologic
disorder.
Cats
Poorlyunderstood disorder.
Mites have been identified on the skin andwithin the oticcanal.
Two species:D.cati and an unnamed species.
Dog/Cat
Dead and degenerateD.canismitesmay be found in noncutaneous sites(e.g.,lymph
node,nstinal wall,een,liver,kidny,urinaryblader,lung,thyroid gland
blood,urine,and feces)and areconsidered torepresent drainagetothese areas by
bloodand/orlymph.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
Dogs andrarely cats.
Potential increased incidence-Siamese andBurmesecatbreeds.
Localized—usually in young dogs;median age 3 to 6months.
Generalized—bothyoungandold animals.

178THE5-MINUTEVETERINARYCONSULT CLINICALCOMPANION
Ivermectin is contraindicated in collies,Shetland sheepdogs,old English sheepdogs,
other herding breeds, and crosses with these breeds; sensitive breeds appear to
tolerate the acaricidal dosages of milbemycin (see below).
Milbemycin (Interceptor)
A macrocylic lactonewith GABA agonist activity.
■Dosage of 1 mg/kg, PO,q24h cures 50% of cases; 2 mg/kg. PO, q24h cures 85% of
cases.
■Treat for 60 days beyond multiple negative skin scrapings.
Cats
Exact protocols are not defined.
■Topical lime-sulfur dips or amitraz solutions applied weekly for four treatments
often lead togoodresolution of clinical signs.
COMMENTS
Amitraz

Other side effectsvomiting, diarrhea,pruritus,polyuria,mydriasis,bradycardia,
hypoventilation,hypotension,hypothermia,ataxia,ileus,bloat,hyperglycemia,
convulsions,and death.
■The incidence and severity of side effects do not appear to be proportional to the
dose or frequency of use.

PossibleInteractions
Amitraz—may interact with heterocyclic antidepressants,xylazine,benzodi-
azepines,and macrocyclic lactones.
■Ivermectinandmilbemycincauseelevatedlevelsofmonoamineneurotransmitter
metabolites,which could result in adverse drug interactions with amitraz and benzo-
diazepines.
■ Multiple skin scrapings and evidence of clinical resolution are used to monitor
progress.
■Avoidbreeding animalswithgeneralized form.
ExpectedCourseandPrognosis
■Prognosis (dogs)—depends heavily on genetic,immunologic,and underlying
diseases.
DEMODICOSIS
179
■Localized—most cases (90%） resolve spontaneously with no treatment; <10%
progress to the generalized form.
■Adult onset (dogs)—often severe and refractory to treatment.
Adult onsetsudden occurrence is often associated with internal disease,malignant
neoplasia, and/or immunosuppressive disease; approximately 25% of cases are idio-
pathic over a follow-upperiod of 1 to 2years.

Dermatophilosis
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
A crustingskindisease in dogs and a nodular subcutaneousandoral diseaseincats.
Reported infrequently.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Dermatophilus congolensis-causative agent:gram-positive,branching filamentous
bacterium classified asan Actinomycete;common cause ofcrusting dermatoses in
hoofed animals,which causescrusted skin lesions of affectedlargeanimals andper-
sistsin theirenvironmentwithincrustsandotherdebrisshedfrominfectedhoof
stock.
Dogs,cats,and humans can rarelybe secondarily infected.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
Association-withfarm animalsor free-roaminglifestyleoftenreported.
Catsepisode of trauma;existence of a foreign body;lesions generally chronic;no
systemic clinical signs,exceptwheninternal organs orlarge oral lesions develop.
Dogs,cats,and humanscan be exposed directly from lesions on largeanimals or
from environmentalexposure.
Infectious stage—requires wetting for activation;probably cannot penetrate intact
epithelium;thus antecedent minor trauma or mechanical transmission by biting
ectoparasitesrequired.
Deeper infections-presumably acquired by traumatic inoculation ofinfectious
material.
CLINICAL FEATURES
Dogs-lesions:papular;crusted;mainly on the skin of the trunk or head;circular to
medius;resemble dermatophilosis in horses(adherent thick,gray-yellow crusts that

Fungal CulturewithMacroconidiaIdentification
Best means of confirming diagnosis.
Hairs that exhibit a positive apple-green fluorescence underWood’s lamp examina-
tion areconsidered ideal candidates forculture.
Pluck hairsfrom theperiphery ofan alopecicarea;donot use arandompattern.

examinethemedia daily.
188THE5-MINUTEVETERINARYCONSULT CLINICALCOMPANION
Microscopic examination of themacroconidia necessary to confirmpathogenic der-
matophyte and to identify genus and species;helps identify source of infection.
Positive culture indicates existence of a dermatophyte;however,it may have been
there only transiently,as commonly occurs when the culture is obtained from the
feet,which arelikely tocomeincontactwith ageophilicdermatophyte
MicroscopicExaminationofHair
s
Time-consuming and often produces falsenegative results.
Use hairs that fluoresceunderWood's lamp illumination to increase thelikelihood
of identifying thefungalhyphae associatedwith thehair shaft.
Wood’s lamp examination is not a very useful screening tool; many pathogenic der-
matophytes do not fluoresce;false fluorescence is common; lamp should warm up
fora minimum of 5minutes and then be exposed to suspicious lesions for up to5
minutes; a true positive reaction associated with M. canis consists of apple-green
fluorescence of the hair shaft;keratin associated with epidermal scales and sebum
will often produce a false-positive fluorescence.
Skin Biopsy
Not usually needed.
Canbe helpful in confirming true invasion and infection.
PathologicFindings
Folliculitis,perifolliculitis, or furunculosis.
Hyperkeratosis.
Intraepidermal pustules.

disease.
Griseofulvin—mostwidely prescribed systemic drug:microsized formulation:25 to
60 mg/kg, PO, q12h for 4 to 6 weeks; ultramicrosized formulation: 2.5 to 5.0 mg/kg.

Consider using griseofulvinfor10 to14 days asaprophylactic treatment of exposed
animals.
190THE5-MINUTEVETERINARYCONSULTCLINICAL COMPANION
Many animalswill self-clear a dermatophyte infection overa period of afewmonths.
Treatment for the disease hastens clinical cure and helps reduce environmental con
tamination.
Some infections, particularly in long-haired cats or multianimal situations, can be
very persistent.
Client Education
Inform owner—that many short-haired cats in a single-cat environment and many
dogs willundergo spontaneous remission.
Advise owner-that treatment canbebothfrustratingandexpensive,especially in
multianimal households or recurrent cases.
Inform ownerthat environmental treatment,including fomites,is important,espe-
cially in recurrent cases;dilute bleach (l:10) is a practical and relatively effective
meansofprovidingenvironmentaldecontamination;concentratedbleachandfor-
malin (1%) are more effective at killing spores, but their use is not as practical in
many situations; chlorhexidine wasineffective in pilot studies.
■Inform owner—that in a multianimal environment or cattery situation, treatment
and control can be very complicated;referral to aveterinarian with expertisein this
type of situation should be considered.

Ehrlichiosis
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
Atick-borne disease of dogs and cats causingvasculitisthrombocytopenia,hyper
globulinemia,andmultisystem dysfunction.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Dogs
Recently reclassified-moved from the family Rickettsiaceae into the family
Anaplasmataceae.
Within thefamilyAnaplasmataceae-threepathogenicgenera:Ehrlichia,Anaplasma,
and Neorickettsia
Ehrlichia spp.—divided into threegroups:
·E.canis-ehrlichiosisfoundintracytoplasmicallyin circulatingleukocytes.
·E.ewingicanine granulocytic ehrlichiosis;like A.phagocytophila,infects
granulocyticcellsindogsbut differsingeographicdistribution(mainlyfound
in southeastern and south-central UnitedStates.)
·E.chaffeensis-like E.canis,tropism formononuclear cells;mainly a human
pathogen but causes disease in dog.
Anaplasma spp.—two organismsof importance:
·A.phagocytophila—previously E.equi,E.phagocytophila,and HGE agent；
infectsmainly horses but also the granulocyticcellsof dogs;serologically indis-
tinguishable from E.canis infection;mainly found in northeastern and upper
Midwesternstatesand California.
·A.platys--previouslyE.platys;tropism forplatelets;doesnot share serologic
crossreactivitywithE.canis.
Neorickettsia spp.—two organismsof importance:
·N.risticii-previously E.ristici;causesPotomac horse fever in horses but also
infectsdogsand cats;like otherNeorickettsia,thisorganismisnottransmitted
by ticks;infections acquired by ingesting infected snails,free nematode life

PathophysiologyforE.canis-Rhipicephalus sanguineus(brown dogtick)transmits
disease to dogs in saliva(Dermacentor variabilis also).
Incubationperiod—l to3weeks.
Three stages of disease:
·Acute-spreads from bite site to the spleen,liver,and lymph nodes (causes
organomegaly),then subclinical,with mild thrombocytopenia;mainly
endothelial cells affected;vasculitis;antiplatelet antibodiesmay exacerbate
thrombocytopenia;variable leukopenia:mild anemia；severity depends on
organism.
·Subclinical—organism persists;antibody response increases (hyperglobuline
mia);thrombocytopenia persists.
·Chronic-impaired bone marrow production(platelets,erythroid suppres-
sion);marrow hypercellular with plasma cells.
Multisystemic disease-includingbleeding tendencies(thrombocytopenia andvas-
culitis),lymphadenopathy,splenomegaly,CNS,ocular（anterioruveitis),and lung

Nonspecific changesmild increases inALT,ALP,BUN,creatinine,and total biliru
bin (rare).
■Hypoalbuminemia-usually from renal loss.
Proteinuria-withor withoutazotemia
Chronic
■CBC—pancytopenia typical;monocytosis and lymphocytosis may be present.
Serum biochemistry profile—hyperglobulinemia;magnitude of globulin increase
correlates with duration of infection; usually polyclonal gammopathy,but mono-
clonal (IgG)gammopathies occur.
■Hypoalbuminemia.
■High BUN and creatinine-from primary renal disease,owing to glomerulonephri-
tis and renal interstitial plasmacytosis.
SerologicTesting
IFA-most clinically useful andreliablemethod.
Highly sensitive—poor specificity with cross-reactivity between E.canis and A.
phagocytophila,but not between E.canis andA.platys.
Titers—reliable 3 weeks after infection;>1:10 diagnostic;paired titers recom-
mendedbecausesingletitercanreflectpastinfection;highseroprevalencecompared
to diseaseprevalence.
Canine Snap 3Dx Diagnostic Test (IDEXX Laboratories,Westbrook,ME)—an in-
housesnaptest that testsfor antibodies against Lymedisease andE.canis,and heart
worm antigen;detects positive titers to E.canis at an equivalent IFA titer of >l:100;
sensitivity of 95%; specificity of 100% (according to manufacturer); however,as with
any serologic test, predictive value also depends not only on sensitivity and speci-
ficity but alsoprevalence;in low-prevalence areas,likely to get a high false positive
rate.
Coombs'-positive anemia (rare)-may be present and confuse the diagnosis.
PCR—proving tobe more sensitive than IFA;tests wholeblood samples; should be
used in conjunction with serololgic testing.
Test for other accompanying pathogens——Babesiosis spp.,Hemobartonellosis spp.
(erythrocyticmycoplasmalinfections),A.platys,and Hepatozoon canis.
Cats
CBC—nonregenerative anemia (not in all cats), leukopenia (in about a third of cats),
and thrombocytopenia (in a quarter of cats).

Feline Calicivirus
Infection
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
Acommonviralrespiratory disease of catscharacterizedbyupperrespiratory tract
signs;ulceration on the tongue,hardpalate,lips,ortipofnoseoraround claws;
pneumonia;and occasionally arthritis.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Asmall,nonenvelopedsingle-stranded RNAvirus.
Numerous strains occur in nature—varying degrees of cross-reactivity.
More than one serotype-most produce similar diseases.
Averyvirulent hemorrhagic strain（FCV-ari)described first in Californiain 1998
but has caused severaloutbreaks since-causes a hemorrhagic disease syndrome
developing1 to5days afterexposure;extremely infectious.
Relativelystable-—resistanttomanydisinfectants.
Transmission-cats may become infected from FCV carriers (some carries shed
virus virtually continuously and thus are always infectiousto other cats);directly
from other catswith acute disease;fomites within the environment (cages,bowls,
etc.).
Routes of infection—nasal,oral,and conjunctival.
Once invadescells-rapid cytolysiswith tissue damageandulceration onmucosal
surfaces.
Clinical disease-commoninmulticat facilities andbreedingcatteries.
Incubation period—clinical disease usually appears3to4 days after exposure.
Neutralizing antibodies-appear about 7 days after exposure,resulting in rapid
recovery.
Persistent infections(carrier states）are common-virus persists in tonsillar and
oropharyngeal tissues,in some cats forlife.
FCV carrierstend tobelow,medium,orhighsheddersinthat they shedfairlycon
stant amountsofvirus;high sheddersarevery infectious toother cats.
Upto25%of healthy catsmaybe sheddingFCVat any one time—vaccinated cats

Unless severe pneumonia ispresent,treat as an outpatient to decrease therisk of
contamination ofthehospital.
Recommend thatownersisolatecatsfrom otherstoprevent transmission.
Careful cleaning of ocularnasal discharges and enticingwithhighlypalatablefoods
will encouragecats tostart eatingagain;feedsoftfood if oral ulcerspresent.
FELINECALICIVIRUSINFECTION211
■Place a feeding tube until ulcers are healed sufficiently to allow cat to start eating.
Acute arthritisrarely requires treatment except for pain medication.
Vaccination
MLVorinactivatedvaccinesshouldbegivenwhenvaccinatedagainstFHV(8 to10
weeksofage)andbooster3to4weekslater.
Inbreedingcolonieswithasevereproblem,vaccinatekittens at an earlier age(4to
5 weeks)or with intranasal administration at 10 to 14 days of age;follow-up vacci-
nations at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age.
Annual booster vaccines recommended,although immunityundoubtedly lasts >l
year.
AmericanAssociation ofFelinePractitionersrecommendsvaccinationofall cats
with corevaccines（againstFHV,FPV,and calicivirus)on initialvisit,after12weeks
of age,and then 1 year later;booster for FCV should thenbe given every 3years.
Administer parenteral MLVvaccine carefullyvaccine virus may induce clinical
signs if it reaches the oral-respiratory mucosa (if cat licks injection sites,or if an
aerosol is produced with the syringe).
■Intranasal MLVvaccination—induces quicker onset andbetter protection thanpar-
enteral MLVvaccination;however,intranasalvaccinationmay induceslight side
effects including sneezing and ocular and nasal discharge; the best protection is
achieved when both intranasal and parenteral vaccinations are given.
■Inactivated adjuvant vaccines—not as effective as MLV vaccines but have a place in
virus-free catteries because there is no risk of spread or revision to virulence; some
are licensed for use in pregnant queens.
Vaccination-will not eliminate infection in a subsequent exposure but will prevent
clinical disease caused by most strains of the virus; vaccination will not prevent
shedding.
Hemorrhagic syndrome—isolation; aggressive fluid therapy including colloid-
containing fluids (hetastarch);treat for DlC with heparin and plasma.
Drugs of Choice
Specific antiviral drugs are not available.
Broad-spectrum antibioticsusuallyindicated topreventsecondarybacterialinfec-
tions;Antibiotics-amoxicillin(22mg/kg,PO,q12h)or doxycycline(10mg/kg,PO,
q24h).
■Antibiotic eye ointment—reduce chance of secondary bacterial infections of the
conjunctiva.
Human rα-interferon (Roferon [Roche, Nutley,NJl)—may improve cats but find-
ings subjective (30U/cat,PO,q24h for7 days,repeated every otherweek)
Precautions/lnteractions
Proper vaccinationprotocol should be explained to clients,especially those owning
catteries,where kittens require vaccination before becominginfected (often at 6 to
8weeks of age)from an infected queen.
■MLV vaccines-not to be used in pregnant queens.

Virus Infection
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
Aviral infection thatcausesimmunodeficiency andneoplasticdiseaseindomestic
cats.

ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Retrovirusgammaretrovirus.
Early infection consists of five stages-(l)viral replication in tonsils andpharyngeal
lymphnodes;(2)infection of a fewcirculatingB lymphocytesand macrophagesthat
disseminate thevirus;(3)replication in lymphoid tissues,intestinal crypt epithelial
cells,andbonemarrowprecursorcells;(4)releaseofinfectedneutrophilsand platelets
from thebonemarrowinto thecirculatory system;and(5)infectionofepithelialand
glandulartissues,with subsequent shedding ofvirus into the saliva andurine.
Adequate immuneresponse—stops progression at stage2or3（4to8weeks after
exposure)and forces thevirus into latency.
Persistent viremia (stages 4 and 5）usually develops 4to6weeks after infection,
but may take 12weeks.
Tumorinduction-occurswhentheDNAprovirusintegratesintocatchromosomal
DNA in critical regions(oncogenes).
Feline sarcoma viruses(mutants ofFeLV)-arise by recombination between the
genes of FeLV and host.
Virus-hostfusionproteinsresponsiblefor theefficientinduction of fibrosarcomas.

Feline Lungworm
(Aelurostrongylus)
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
Ahelminth infection in catscausing a spectrumofdisease from asymptomaticto
severe respiratory distresswith weight loss.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Aelurostrongylus abstrusus-ametastrongyloidaeparasite.
Adult worms-curl within thelung parenchyma,producing small grayish-white
subpleural nodules.
Adultswormslay eggswithin the alveoli of the lungs,where they develop toL1
larvaethathatchandascendthetracheatobeswallowedandeventually appearin
thefeces.
L1 larvae-enter snails and slugs,where they develop toL3,which areinfective to
cats.
Cats-also probablybecomeinfected by eatingparatenic hosts (birds and rodents).
PPP=5to6weeks.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
Outdoorcatsthat huntbirds androdentshave a higherincidence.
CLINICAL FEATURES
Mostcats-—asymptomatic.
Coughing-most consistent sign.
Respiratory distress-occasional sign.
Severe infections—can produce lethargy andweight loss,especially inyoung cats.
Pleural effusion—rare consequence of infection.

Inpatient—severe cases;hydration and replacement electrolyte therapy.
Plasma transfusions-if plasma protein<4g/dl.
Wholeblood transfusions--rarely required because cats do not get that anemic.
■Outpatient—mild cases.
Drugs ofChoice
Broad-spectrum antibiotics（ampicillin/gentamicin combination)to counter sec
ondarybacterialinfectionfrom Gltractflora
Vaccination—completely preventable by routine vaccination of kittens;vaccination
after thedevelopmentofclinicalsignsiscontraindicated.
VaccinationsMLV or inactivated parenteral vaccines and MLV intranasal vaccine.
Immunity-long duration,perhaps even for life.
Kittens-vaccinate at 8 to 10 weeks of age; then after 12 weeks of age when mater-
nally derived immunity has waned.
Boosters—after1year;repeat every3 years toprovide excellent immunity
Precautions/lnteractions
Chronic enteritis—due tovilus blunting and overgrowth with fungal infection or
other pathogens notusually affected by antibiotics (protozoa,fungal,yeast)
Teratogenic effects (cerebellar hypoplasia resulting in ataxia for life)virus infec-
tion of fetus.
Monitor renalfunction closely if administeringgentamicin-donot administer to

COMMENTS
Inform client that all current and future cats in thehousehold must be vaccinated
against FPV before exposurethe virus will remain infectious on the premise for
years unless environment can be adequately disinfected.
Disinfection—can be achieved with 1:32 dilution of household bleach.
■Recovered cats are immune against FPV infection for life—do not require further
vaccination.
Prognosis-most cases acute,lasting only 5 to 7 days; if death does not occur dur-
ing the acute disease,recovery is usually rapid and uncomplicated.

FLEASANDFLEA CONTROL
Fleas and flea dirtabsence isnot always a reliable indicator of successful treatment
in very sensitive animals.
Year-round warm climatesyear-round flea control.
Seasonally warm climates-begin flea control in May or June.
Allergy—-approximately 80% of atopic dogs are also allergic to fleabites.
Organophosphates—use with utmost caution in old animals;not recommended for
use in very young animals (<3 months of age).
In areas of moderate to severe flea infestation-humans can be bitten by fleas;usu-
allypapularlesions are located on thewrists and ankles.
Corticosteroids and organophosphates-do not use in pregnant bitches and queens.
Carefully follow thelabel directionsfor each individual productto determine its
safety.

Giardiasis
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
Entericprotozoaninfectionthatcancausesmall bowel diarrheaindogsandcats,but
usually asymptomatic.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Several species—Giardia lamblia (humans),G.canis (dogs),and G.felis(cats),but
cross-infection occurs.
Zoonosis-G.canis is not considered zoonotic,but G.lamblia cysts that infect
humanshave been identified in dogs(althoughrarely) and are consideredzoonotic.
Transmission—ingestion of cysts,which are usually water-borne,but also auto-
transmission(cystssurvivewell adhered to theperianalregionandinapet'scon-
taminatedenvironment)common.
Flagellated tachyzoitesreleased(from cysts)—in Gl tract attach to small intestinal
enterocytes.
Causesmalabsorption syndromesugarsvitaminB,folatetriglyceris.
Specifichistologicchanges-notidentified,but blunting of intestinal villi can ensue.
Cysts-found infeces,but also trophozoites(especially in animalswith diarrhea)
Cysts-surviveformonthsinmoistcoolenvironmentoutsidehost.
Trophozoites-donotsurvive outsidehostand arenot infective.
PPP=5to12days（dogs）and5to16days（cats)
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY

crowdingstress,diet,concurrent Gl tract disease).

CLINICALFEATURES
Usually excrete cystswith no signs.
Diarrhea often small bowel (young animals);rancid odor,soft,frothy,pale,and
steatorrheic.

DIFFERENTIALDIAGNOSIS
Anything thatcausesacutesmall boweldiarrhea,includingdietaryindiscretion;IBD;
neoplasia (especially GI tract lymphoma);drugs (antibiotics);toxins (lead):para-
sites(cryptosporidiosis,trichomoniasis,whipworms);infectiousagents(parvovirus,

leishmaniasis,otherrare infections—pythiosis）;systemic organ dysfunction（renal,
hepatic,pancreatic,cardiac）;metabolic（hypoadrenocorticism,hyperthyroidismof
cats).
DIAGNOSTICS
Findingcysts(Fig.48-1)inan animalwith diarrhea—doesnot alwaysmean the
diarrhea is caused by Giardia.

rhea)or cysts;a drop of fecesmixedwith a drop of Lugol'siodine kills the tropho-
zoitesandstainsthembrown somorphologycanbeexamined(under40xmagni-

tivein diagnosingGiardiainfectionindogs.
THERAPEUTICS
If diarrhea is severe, treat supportively.
Many recent studies suggest that when controlling diarrhea in animals with giardia
sis,antigiardiacidal drug treatment must be coupled with measures to clean cysts
fromtheanimal'senvironmentandcoat.
■QUAT (Roccal [Winthrop Labs,New York,NY];Totil [Calgon Corp.,St.Louis,
MO])—inactivate cystswithin 1 minute of contact at room temperature;must
clean up organic material first;can use on coat of animals as a rinse (allowing con-
tact for 1 minute, then thoroughly rinse off) after washing the coat with a pet
shampoo first to remove organic matter, then dry coat well (cysts very susceptible
to drying).
Vaccination
■Giardia vaccine (GiardiaVax for cats and dogs [Fort Dodge Animal Health,Fort
Dodge,IA])-made of chemically inactivated trophozoites.
Pups and kittens(7-week-old and naive to Giardia exposure)—receiving one vac-
cine and a booster 3 weeks later,were immune to a Giardia challenge 6 and 12
months later.
Older dogs-vaccination reduced the duration of cyst shedding and the number of
cysts shed.
■The vaccine has been used as an immunotherapeutic agent in dogs: 13 dogs that
failed tobe curedofgiardiasisusingchemotherapeuticmeasures showed clinical
cures and cessation of fecal cyst shedding between 3 to 10 weeks postvaccination
treatment ofsome chronically infected dogs in which chemotherapy and hygiene
control methods havefailed.
Vaccination-in some studies,vaccination failed to prevent reinfection.
Vaccination—-anecdotal reports of asymptomatic infected dogs developing clinical
symptoms ofdiarrhea afterreceiving thevaccine.
■Vaccinationforcats-vaccinated4,6,and10weeksafterexperimentallyinfected
failed to clear the infection, suggesting that the vaccine may not be efficacious in
those cats already infected.
Vaccine—-little utility as a general vaccine for the control of giardiasis in the gener-
al population of dogs because most are exposed to the organismbefore vaccination.
Drugs ofChoice
No drug is registered foruse against Giardia inNorthAmerica.
Fenbendazole and combination of febantel-praziquantel-pyrantel (Drontal Plus
[Bayer Co., Shawnee Mission,KS])are preferred because of the lack of side-effects
and high efficacy.
GIARDIASIS
263
Fenbendazole（Panacur[Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Co.,Somerville,NJ])-over90%
efficacy,can be used in pregnant animals,unlike other benzimadazoles.

shownveryeffectivewhencombinedwithcontrolmethods.
Oxfendazole suspension-availableinUnited States(SynanthicBovineDewormer
Suspension9.06%[Fort Dodge,Fort Dodge,IA]);not registered foruse in dogs.

Tinidazole,ipronidazole,quinacrine,and furazolidonesome have good efficacy
but high side effects.
Precautions/Interactions
Albendazole,butnot fenbendazole,is suspected ofbeing teratogenic and,therefore,
shouldnotbegiven topregnant animals.
At higher doses,albendazolecan cause myelosuppression in both dogs and cats.
Metronidazole at higher doses(>30 mg/kg)can produce neurologic signs,includ-

Heartworm Disease:Dogs
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
Parasitic infection of the pulmonary arteries of dogs causingrespiratory pulmonary
hypertension,embolization,allergicpneumonitis,eosinophilicgranulomas),cardiac
(myocardial hypertrophy and,in some animals,congestive heart failure due tohigh
right ventricle afterload),and renal (immune complex glomerulonephropathy)
disease.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Dirofilaria immitis-adults(femaleworms up to30cmlong)livein thepulmonary
arteriesof dogs,leading toendothelial damage andmyointimal proliferation.
Pulmonary artery damage-results in lobar arterial enlargement,tortuosity,and
obstruction,causing pulmonary hypertension and thrombosis.
Severity of disease-directlyrelatedtothenumber ofworms,duration of infection,
andhostresponse.
Femaleadultworms-releaseLl（microfilaria)intocirculation(canlive there for
2years).

ProphylaxisofNoninfectedDogs
Heartworm prophylaxis-should be provided for all dogs at risk
Newpatients starting onprophylaxis for thefirst timea test to detect microfilaria
maybeindicated because some macrolide endectocides (milbemycin) may induce a
shock syndrome within 24 hours of the first dose;antigen test before starting pre-
ventive treatment insuchcasesis indicatedtorule outpossible adultinfection
（ifpositive,consider adulticide treatment optionsbutstart prophylaxis treatment
immediately as long aspatient is microfilaremic negative).
Ivermectin (Heartgard [Merial,Iselin,NJl)—highly effective monthly preventive;
retroactive efficacy as long as4months afterinfection when monthly administration
iscontinued for12months;when combined with pyrantel pamoate(Heartgard Plus
[Merial,Iselin,NJl),also controls hookworm and roundworm infection;can be
given safely to microfilaremic dogs,including so-called ivermectin-sensitive dogs.
■Milbemycin oxime (Interceptor [Novartis,Greensboro,NC])—highly effective
monthly preventive; also controls hookworms,roundworms,and whipworms; the
preventive dosage is microfilaricidal; acute reactions may occur when given to
microfilaremic dogs.
Moxidectin (ProHeart tablets [Fort Dodge,Fort Dodge,IA])—a monthly preventive;
can be given to microfilaremic dogs.
Moxidectin (ProHeart6 injectable [Fort Dodge,Fort Dodge,IA])—prophylactic effec
tivefor at least 6months afterinjection;currentlynot availablein theUnitedStates.
Selamectin（Revolution[Pfizer,Exton,PA.])-monthly topicalpreventive;also con

Infection in dogsismainly characterized by severe periosteal proliferation,butmay
affect multiple organ systems.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Hepatozoon americanum—infects dogsin southern and southwesternUnitedStates
(Texas to Georgia).
Domestic cats-extremelyrare(one casereported in Hawai).
Infection-ingestion of tickvector(Amblyommamaculatum)orbybitefromtick.
Vertical transmission topuppies-can occur.
Complexpathogenesis—complicatedby otherfactorsaffectingimmunestatus.
Factorsincludeconcurrentinfections,suchaswithdistemper,parvovirus,Babesia,
Ehrlichia,andLeishmania.
Age at infection—animportant determinant of clinical disease development.
If infected young-more chance of developing periosteal bone proliferation.
Experimental infections-developbloody diarrhea3days postinfection (lasts2to

Histoplasmosis
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
Systemic fungal infectionresulting inmainly intestinal tract disease in thedog,and
respiratory disease in thecat,but affectingmultiple organsincluding liver,spleen,
bonemarrow,bone,lung and lymph nodes)inboth species.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Histoplasma capsulatum-mycelial form,whichgrowsinbirdmanureororganically
enrichedsoilproducesinfectious spores(microconidia).
Microconidiainhaledinto terminalairwaysspores germinatein lungsand develop
intoyeast form.
Yeast form-phagocytizedbymacrophagesanddistributed throughout thebody

DIFFERENTIALDIAGNOSIS
Dogs
Severe chronic diarrhea and weight loss-GI lymphoma;IBD (lymphocytic plasma-
cytic,eosinophilic)，exocrine pancreatic insufficiency,and chronic parasitism
(whipworms).
Respiratory signsa general differential diagnosis for respiratory signs and cough
includes such categories as:
Cardiovascular (pulmonary edema; enlarged heart,especially the left atrium;
left-sided heart failure; pulmonary emboli） and congenital (hypoplastic
trachea).
HISTOPLASMOSIS
295
·Allergic(bronchial asthma,chronic bronchitis,eosinophilic pneumonia or
granulomatosis,pulmonary infiltratewitheosinophilia).
Trauma (foreignbody,irritatinggases,collapsing trachea）
·Neoplasia(not only of therespiratory treebut also associated structures such
asribs,lymph nodes,muscles).
Inflammatory (pharyngitis;tonsillitis;kennel cough from such agents as
Bordetella bronchoseptica,parainfluenza virus，infectious laryngotracheitis
virus,and mycoplasma;bacterial bronchopneumonia;chronic pulmonary
fibrosis;pulmonary abscess or granuloma;COPD);other fungal agents (blas
tomycosis,cryptococcosis);pleural space diseases.
Parasites（Oslerus[Filaroides]osleri,Crenosomavulpis,Capillaria aerophila,F
milksi,Paragonimuskellicotti,Dirofilariaimmitis-heartworm disease)
·Lymphnodeenlargementsimilartolymphosarcoma differentiatedbylymph
node aspirate cytology.

Cats
Respiratory signsdifferentiatefrom heart disease,feline asthma,parenchymal lung
disease （pneumonia,parasiticlungworms,neoplasia,toxoplasmosis),andpleural
disease(pyothorax,neoplasia).
Lamenessdifferentiate from trauma,catbite abscess,spinal lymphoma,andpoly
arthritis.
Ocular disease-lymphoma,toxoplasmosis,andFIP
DIAGNOSTICS
CBC—usually moderate to severe nonregenerative anemia;usually normal leuko-
cyte counts but can have leukocytosis(rarely leukopenia from bonemarrow involve-
ment);frequently see thrombocytopenia.
Peripheral bloodsmears-mayfindHistoplasma organismsinmonocytesor neu-
trophils (Fig.54-1)orbone marrow aspirate （Fig.54-2).
Biochemical panel—elevated hepatic enzymes(liverinvolvement),hypoalbumine-
mia(intestinal tract involvement),hyperglobulinemia.
AGID test—detects antibodies against H.capsulatum;supports diagnosis;positive
result usuallyindicates activeinfection,althoughfalsepositiveresult can occur(sug
gestspast infection);false negativeresults are common.
Coombstest—maybepositivebecauseantibodiestoH.capsulatummaycross-react
with RBCs.
Imaging:
·Thoracicradiographs-diffuse interstitial-to-nodular pneumonia;enlarged tra-
cheobronchial lymphnodes compressing the tracheal bifurcation(Fig.54-3） in
dogs(rare in cats).
·Abdominal imaging-organomegaly (liver,spleen,lymph nodes).

Severe complicated cases:
·Anorexia.
·Moist,productive cough.
·Lethargy.
·Dyspnea and exercise intolerance.
CLINICALFEATURES
Uncomplicated—cough readily induced with tracheal pressure;other physical
examinationfindingsncludinglungsoundsusuallynormal.
Severe—low-gradefever,tachypnea,dyspnea,cough,increased lung sounds,crack-
les,and wheezes (less frequently)
Paroxysmal cough-easily elicited on tracheal palpation
DIFFERENTIALDIAGNOSIS
Ageneral differential diagnosisforcough includes suchcategoriesas:
Cardiovascular(pulmonary edema;pleuraleffusions;enlarged heart,especially
the left atrium;pulmonary emboli.
Allergic(bronchitis，eosinophilicpneumonia or granulomatosis,pulmonary
infiltratewitheosinophilis)
Trauma(foreign body,irritatinggases,collapsing trachea).
Neoplasia(notonlyof therespiratorytreebut also associatedstructuressuch
as ribs,lymph nodes,muscles).
Inflammatory (pharyngitis,tonsillitis,bacterial bronchopneumonia,chronic
pulmonaryfibrosis,pulmonary abscessorgranuloma,chronicobstructivepul-
monary disease).
Parasites（Capillaria aerophila,Oslerus[Filaroides]osleri,Filaroideshirthi,F.
milksi,Paragonimuskellicotti,Dirofilariaimmitis-heartwormdisease).
Kennel cough-often a clinical diagnosisbased on a history of sudden onset,recent
exposure tolikelypathogens(boarding),lackofrecentvaccinations fortherespira-
tory pathogens,lack of other clinical signs other than cough,and cough easily

315
THERAPEUTICS
Stronglyrecommend—to treatuncomplicated cases as outpatients to prevent hospi
tal contamination.
Hospitalizeonly thosewith pneumonia that require IV fluid support.
Enforced rest—for at least 14 to 21 days (uncomplicated cases);2months in cases
of pneumonia.
■Owner should be aware of infectivity of dog to other dogsshould be encouraged
to isolate the patient from other dogs (even up to months after recovery because B.
bronchiseptica can be present in respiratory tract for months after infection).
■Dogswithuncomplicateddisease-shouldrespondto treatment in10to14days
DrugsofChoice
Broad-spectrum antibiotics in uncomplicatedcases—amoxicillin/clavulanic acid,
doxycycline,or TMS.
Severe cases that are resistant to first-choice antibiotic therapies abovecombina-
(cefazolin).May use enrofloxacin as alternative to gentamicin.
■In severe cases (bronchopneumonia)—continue at least 2 weeks past radiographic
resolution of signs.
Resistant bacteria(B.bronchiseptica and others)—important to culture and establish
the bacterial sensitivity; may need to deliver antibiotics by nebulization (kanamycin
Cough suppressants—-butorphanol (Torbutrol [Fort Dodge, Fort Dodge, IA] or
hydrocodone bitartrate(Hycodan)[DuPont Pharma,Wilmington,DE]) often effec-
tive in suppressing a dry,nonproductive cough.
Bronchodilators（theophylline or aminophylline)-offerlittlehelpbutmay relieve
clinically apparent wheezing(Table57-1).
Vaccination-available for B.bronchiseptica and CPl;intranasal vaccines generally
considered to offer superiorprotection because they induce both local and systemic
immunity,they arenot affectedby maternal antibody,and they protect against chal-
lenge more rapidly than parenteral vaccines; vaccinate puppies intranasally as early
as2 to4weeks of age,followed byrevaccination annually;mayvaccinatemature
dogs with a one-dose intranasal vaccination; a single booster at least 5 days before
exposure in dogs not vaccinated in the previous 6 months is recommended.
■Best protection is achieved when both intranasal and parenteral vaccines given
togetherorsequentially
Precautions/lnteractions
TMS—multiple adverse reactions,including:
·KCS-monitor tear production weekly throughout treatment.
·Hepatotoxicity—anorexia,depression,icterus; monitor ALT—if prolonged
therapy.
INFECTIOUSCANINETRACHEOBRONCHITIS(KENNELCOUGH)317
Uncomplicated casesshould resolve within 10 to14 days;ifpatientcontinues to

Kidney Worm
(Dioctophyma)
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
Anematode parasite（the largest in existence),the adults of which arefound in the
abdominal cavity andrenalpelvisof dogs(rarelyinfect cats).
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Dioctyophyma renale—mink are the definitive host (in which the adult worm is
much smaller);occasionally found in dogs.
Femaleworm(can reach1meter inlength)—laysbrownish,thick-shelledeggswith
bipolarplugs.
Eggs-passed in theurine;mature to larvated eggs(if enter water)over about a
month.
Larvated eggs—infect earthworms to hatch L1 that develop toL3.
Dogs-becomeinfected afteringestingparatenic hosts(intestines of fishorfrogs）or
earthworms containing theL3.
L3larvae-migrate through thestomachwall,cross theperitoneal cavity to enter the
liver,where they molt to L4.
L4 larvae-enter the peritoneal caviy,moltto adults before entering the renal
capsule.
Adultworms-migrate to the renal pelvis(usuallyof the rightkidney)
Exact mechanism ofhowadultworms destroy therenal parenchyma-unknown.
Hydronephrosisandpyelonephritismayplay arolein thepathogenesis.
Histopathology-shows destruction of therenal tubules surrounded by chronic
inflammation,with preservation of manyglomeruli.
Worms in the peritoneal cavity-produce a serofibrinous to chronic fibrinous
peritonitis.
Wormsin closeproximity to theliver-cause large erosionson theliver(andeven
severehemorrhagefromliverrupture)
Eggs-often foundwithin chronic granulomaswithin the peritoneal cavity.
The severity of renal disease-dependson thenumber ofparasites in thekidney,the
numberof kidneysinfected,duration ofinfection,andthepresenceof concomitant
renal disease.

Dogs
A general differential diagnosis for cough includes such categories as:
Cardiovascular(pulmonary edema;enlarged heart,especially theleft atrium;
left-sided heart failure;pulmonary emboli).
Allergic(bronchial asthma,eosinophilic pneumonia or granulomatosis,pul-
monaryinfiltratewitheosinophilia).
·Trauma (foreign body，irritating gases,collapsing trachea,hypoplastic
trachea).
·Neoplasia(not onlyof therespiratory treebut also associated structuressuch
as ribs,lymph nodes,muscles).
·Inflammatory (pharyngitis;tonsilltis;kennel cough from such agents as
Bordetella bronchiseptica,parainfluenza virus,infectious laryngotracheitis
virus,andmycoplasma;bacterial bronchopneumonia;aspiration pneumonia;
fungal pneumonia;chronicpulmonary fibrosis;pulmonary abscess orgranulo-

Nasal Mites
(Pneumonyssoides)
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
Arthropod found in thenasal cavity and sinuses of dogs,leading to sneezing,chronic
nasal discharge,and epistaxis.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Pneumonyssoidescaninum-mite
Transmission-directcontactwith aninfested animal.
The mite causes inflammation of the nasal mucosa(especially the olfactory area)
possiblyleading to a loss of sense of smell by the host.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
Although not common inNorth America,theprevalence canbehighin some north-
ernEuropean countries(20%inSweden,7%inNorway).
Nosex,breed,orage distribution,althoughdogs>3years ofagearemorelikelyto
be infested.
Most clinically apparent infestations require large numbers(>50)of mites,whereas
smallnumbers(<20)often causeno clinical signs.
CLINICALFEATURES
Sneezing—often reverse sneezing
Epistaxis.
Chronic nasal discharge.

SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
Natural infections occurin dogs,with hunting/farm dogs overrepresented.
Serologicprevalencein farm dogs-usually>30%.
Puppies(<6months of age)-overrepresented.
Cats-no natural cases havebeenreported in cats.
CLINICALFEATURES
Similar to those of toxoplasmosis,except neurologicandmuscular abnormalities
predominate and are often more severe.
Young dogs(<6monthsof age):
·Ascendingparalysisis common.
·Distinguished from other forms of paralysisby gradual muscle atrophy.

Salmon Poisoning
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
Arickettsial infectionof dogs livinginthePacificnorthwest oftheUnitedStates.
causinga systemicillnesscharacterized byvomiting,diarrhea,andfever.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Neorickettsia helminthoeca-a rickettsial organism with a trematode vector,
Nanophyetus salmonincola.
Dogsbecome infected byingestingrawfish thathaveeaten thetrematodevector or
by ingesting thevector or organism directly from water.
The organism invades the small intestinal epithelium andassociated lymphoid
tissue.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
Only dogs infected.
No age,sex,orbreed predilection.
Historyof ingestion ofrawfishcaught in an endemicregion.
CLINICAL FEATURES
Fever--initially
Anorexia.
Weight loss.
Diarrheaandvomitingmayoccur.
Diarrhea-becomes progressivelymore severe andmay consistmainly ofblood at
the time of death.
Lymphadenopathy-especially cervical and prescapular.

COMMENTS
The sooner therapy is instituted after ingestion ofrawfish—the better is the
prognosis.

DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
Dogs and catsmaybe parasitized by hard ticks of the family Ixodidae.
Ectoparasites that feedonly on theblood of theirhosts;arthropods;closelyrelated
to scorpions,spiders,and mites.
Transmitted microbial pathogens:protozoa,helminths,fungi,bacteria,rickettsiae,

generally painless;local irritation and infection may ocur.

ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Toxoplasmagondi-anobligateintracellularcoccidianprotozoanparasite.
Infection—acquired by ingestion of tissue cysts oroocysts.
After infection-organism spreads to extraintestinal organs via blood or lymph,
resultinginfocalnecrosisofmany organs（heart,eye,central nervous system）.
Acute disseminated infection-rarelyfatal.
Chronically-tissuecystsform toproducelow-gradedisease thatusuallyisnot clin-

immunosuppression (e.g.,canine distemper,FIP,FIV,FeLV).
Severityandmanifestationsofdisease-dependonlocation anddegreeoftissue
injury caused bytissue cysts.
Distribution-worldwide.
Approximately30%of cats and up to50%ofhumans in some countries are sero-

Zoonosis-causes severemyositis and sometimesdeathin humans.
In Chinaeatingdogmeat is an important sourceof trichinosis inhumans.
Distribution-worldwide.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Trichinella spiralis-dogs and cats becomeinfected by eatingLl larvae sequestered
in themuscle of other animals.
Sources of infection—wild caught rodents or the carcasses of carnivores (mainly
cats),or foxes,opossum,raccoons,andwild pigs（dogs).
Ll larvae-molt to adultsin the small intestine.
Adult worms—produce large numbers of“prelarvae,”which are injected into the
intestinal mucosa.
Prelarvae-migratevia lymphatics initially,then theblood stream to skeletal mus-
cles,where they coilup and develop toLl in cyst-like structures.
Ll larvae-remaininfectivein themuscleformonths toyears.
Dogs-only averyfewlarvae areneededforinfection.
Ingestionof largenumbersof larvae-resultsinsamedegreeofmusclesequestration

Trichomoniasis
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
Entericpear-shapedmotileflagellatedprotozoasimilarto Giardiaorganismsthat
inhabits thelarge intestine of cats,dogs,and humans.
One species causes diarrhea in cats.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Pentatrichomonas hominis（family:trichomonads)inhabits thelargeintestineof
cats,dogs,and humans.
Nonpathogenic in dogs and cats-except very rarely，when itmay become an oppor-
tunisticpathogen.
Tritrichomonas foetus(etiologicagent ofinfertility and abortion in cattle)-causes
diarrhea in cats.

Parasites colonize the terminalileum,cecum,and colon-leads to large bowel
diarrhea.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
High population density (catteries,shelters)may be a riskfactor for infection.
CoinfectionwithGiardia spp.—common.
Young cats-usually under 1year(range:3monthsto13years).

Trichosporonosis
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
A systemic or localized fungal infectioncausinggranulomasusually on the nose;also
can causesystemicinfectionsincats
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Not considered to be primary pathogens-infectanimals that areimmunosup-
pressed,arereceivingmultiplebroad-spectrum antibiotics,orhave neoplasia.
In severely immunosuppressed host--fungus invades mucosal surfacesof the Gl,
urinary,and respiratorytracts,withsubsequent dissemination.
Cats-infections are characterized by pyogranulomatous inflammation of the
mucosa,submucosa,and subcutaneous tissue.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
Usually older cats.
Althoughimmunosuppression hasnotbeen documented inmostfelinecases,it has
been suspected.
CLINICALFEATURES
Nasal mass (Fig.101-1).

Tularemia
DEFINITION/OVERVIEW
An acute systemicbacterial infection of cats (rarely dogs) that can result in sep-
ticemiagenralizedlymphadenopathylenomegalyhpatomegaly,lingualulcrs,
and icterus.
ETIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Francisella tularensis-smallgram-negative facultativeintracellular coccobacilli
foundmainlyinwildrabbitsandrodents.
North Americamost cases described from Missouri,Alaska,Oklahoma,Illinois,
Utah,Maine,South Dakota,Tennessee,Kansas,and Colorado.
Peakoccurrence-—JunetoAugust.
Infection-occurs by ingestion of tissue or body fluids of infected animal or con-
taminatedwaterorbybiteofablood-suckinginsect（ticks,flies,mites,midges,fleas，
andmosquitoes).
Dogs resistant.
Onlya fewbacteria needed toinfectcats through skin,airways,orconjunctiva.
Largenumber of bacteria needed to infect-via GI tract.
Once inoculatedorganisms spreadvia lymphatics toregional lymph nodes,then
blood stream(septicemia),causing acute disease2to7days afterinfection.
SIGNALMENT/HISTORY
Cats mainly;dogsrelativelyresistant.
Higherprevalence in outdoor/huntingcats.
Exposure to infected lagomorphs androdents.
Contact with bitinginsects.
CLINICALFEATURES
