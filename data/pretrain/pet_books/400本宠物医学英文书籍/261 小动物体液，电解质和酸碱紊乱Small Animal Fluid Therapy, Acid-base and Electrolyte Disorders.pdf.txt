Take-home message: For this patient, if the fluid losses continue the animal will be
in a constant state of fluid deficit. The amount of intravenous fluids that the animal
is receiving must be increased. One way to do this is to replace the fluid deficit (in
this case, 30 ml) over the next 6 hour period, in addition to the original rate of
fluid administration (45 mL/hr). In this case, the intravenous fluid rate could be
increased by5mL/hr(to50mL/hr),and reassessed (recalculated)after 6hours.Any
ongoing losses should continue to be weighed, as well as the animal, to make sure
the patient's fluid deficit and ongoing losses are matched by intake.

of 60 g of vomitus, has defecated 90 g of diarrhea, and has produced a total of I00 mL of urine. At

has been replaced over the past 36 hours. The patient is currently on 45 mL/hr of a balanced

32 CHAPTER 2 Techniques and complications of vascular access
Auricular catheter
23
In some breeds with large ears and auricular
veins, such as Dachshunds and hound breeds,
intravenous catheters can be placed in the ears
(23).2 The dorsolateral aspect of the ear
surface is clipped, and aseptically prepared as
described previously. Several gauze 4 × 4 inch
(100 mm x 100 mm) squares are rolled and
secured with 1 inch (25 mm) adhesive tape.
The gauze roll is placed under the ear and
the ear is molded over the gauze roll. The
auricular vein should be visible on the
dorsolateral aspect of the pinna. The ear is held
flat over the clinician's fingers, and the vessel

through the skin directly into the vessel by
holding the catheter parallel to the ear (24).
Once a flash of blood is observed, the catheter
is advanced into the vessel and secured in place
24
with lengths of tape around the ear.
Gauze rolls are used to stabilize the ear and
prevent the catheter from becoming dislodged
or kinking (25). Auricular catheters are often
used during surgery and in extremely critical
 patients. Once an animal is mobile, placement
of a different peripheral or central catheter
often becomes necessary as auricular catheters
are easily dislodged with patient movement.
 24 The dorsal, lateral aspect of the patient's ear
is clipped and aseptically prepared. By holding
the ear flat, and simultaneously occluding
outflow of blood from the auricular vein,the
operator can insert a catheter on the dorsal
25
aspect of the ear.
 25 Following insertion of the catheter into the
auricular vein, a piece of 0.5 inch (12 mm)
surgical adhesive tape is placed around the
catheter hub.To secure the catheter in place,
prevent movement, and make the tape easier to
secure around the ear, pieces of rolled up gauze
are placed on the ventral surface of the ear, and
the tape is then placed around the bundle.

Long catheters can be placed into the jugular,

To place an intraosseous catheter, the

palpate for the greater trochanter of the femur,
and, holding the catheter in their dominant
hand, gently push the catheter stylette
through the skin and into the underlying
intertrochanteric fossa with a simultaneous
pushing and twisting motion (43). Once the
needle is through the first cortex of the bone,
the operator should feel less resistance as the 
needle passes into the marrow cavity. The
catheter can be flushed with heparinized or
nonheparinized saline. The saline solution
should flow easily through the catheter. If the
fush solution does not flow easily, two things
must be considered: either the catheter is not
in its proper place, or the catheter is clogged
with bony debris. Pieces of bony debris will

VASCULAR CUTDOWN
52
Vascular access may be very diffcult in animals
that are severely dehydrated, hypovolemic,
hypotensive, hypothermic, obese, or have
peripheral edema.2.7 In such instances, it may
also be diffcult to place an intraosseous
catheter, particularly in large adult or obese
animals. For this reason, veterinary personnel
should be adept at performing vascular
cutdowns when necessary in the emergent
situation.
 52 The skin is tented and the area over the
vascular cutdown should be secured in a sterile
vessel infiltrated with local anesthetic, such as

is a good idea to keep a surgical pack in the

should contain a scalpel handle, scalpel blade,
curved and straight hemostats and mosquito

gauze 4 × 4 inch (100 × 100 mm) squares, and

Any vessel that can have a peripheral
means is a candidate for having a catheter
placed via vascular cutdown. The jugular,

to locate and catheterize because of their size
and location.5

64 An intravenous infusion of hypertonic saline (Step I) loads the vasculature with a large number of
osmotically active partides such that the intravascular space becomes hyperosmolar in relation to the
interstitium and the cells (Step 2). By the process of osmosis,fluid leaves the interstitial (Step 3), then the
intracellular compartments (Step 4) in an attempt to normalize serum osmolality. The net movement of
interstitial and intracellular water into the vascular space transiently increases intravascular fuid volume.
Once serum osmolality is diluted and becomes equilibrated towards normal (Step 5),the fuid within the
vascular space will move back into the interstitial and intracellular compartments unless the hypertonic
saline is infused along with a colloid. The colloid protects and maintains the fluid load within the intravascular
compartment to maintain circulating blood volume. Because the interstitium and intracellular space are now
effectively dehydrated, boluses of hypertonic saline and colloid should be followed by administration of an
isotonic crystalloid fuid so that the balance of fluids between all compartments is normalized.

dependent coagulation factors (II, VII, IX, X),
immunoglobulins, and albumin, but is relatively
devoid of the labile clotting factors. FP has a
shelf-life of 5 years after the original date of
collection, or 4 years after expiration of a unit of
FFP. Packed RBCs should be stored at l-6C
immediately after collection and processing. FP
and pRBCs can also be prepared in the absence
of a reffigerated centrifuge by storing the unit of
whole blood upnight in a l-62C refigerator for
12-24 hours, until the RBCs have separated out.
The plasma can be drawn off into a second
storage bag and frozen as FP. Due to the delay
in processing, the resultant plasma does not
contain the labile clotting factors. FFP, FP,
cyoprecipitate, and cryo-poor plasma should be
stored at -202C until use. The products should

 5. Use the following guidelines to determine the volume of each parenteral nutrition component

11. Divide the total volume of Step 10 by 24 hours, to yield a fluid rate per hour.
Example of calculating parenteral nutrition for a 30 kg dog:
 1. Calculate the patient's daily REE:
(30 × 30) + 70 = 970 kcal/day
2. Calculate the daily carbohydrate source:
20% = 0.2 × 970 kcal'day = 194 kcal/day carbohydrate (dextrose)
3. Calculate the daily lipid source:
80% = 0.8 × 970 kcal/day = 776 kcal/day lipid
4. Calculate the daily amino acid (protein) requirement (3 g amino acid [protein]/100 kcal in dogs):
Aepy(ujaioid) ppe oujwe 6 1'6z = jeoy 00 t/(uaioud) pipe oujwe 6 e x Aep/iey 0/6
5. 50% dextrose = 1.7 kcal'ml:
194 kcal × 1 mL/1.7 kcal = 114 mL of 50% dextrose/day
 20% lipid = 2 kcal/ml:
776 kcal × 1 mL/2 kcal = 388 mL 20% lipid
 29.1 g amino acid (protein)/day × 1 mL/0.085 g amino acid (protein) = 342 ml/day 8.5% amino acid

6. Add the volume of dextrose, lipid, and amino acid (protein) required:
114 mL 50% dextrose
388 mL 20% lipid
+ 342 mL 8.5% amino acid (protein) = 844 mL/day
7. Divide the above volume by 24 to yield mL/hour rate of administration:
844 ml/day + 24 hours = 35.1 = 35 mL/hour
OR
8. Determine the patient's daily fluid requirement (60 mL/kg/day)
60 mL/kg/day × 30 kg = 1800 mL/day
9. Subtract the parenteral nutrition volume from daily fluid requirement:
1800 mL/day - 844 mL/day = 956 ml
10. Add 956 ml of an isotonic fluid such as Normosol-R to the parenteral nutrition solution.
