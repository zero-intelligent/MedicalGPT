PREFACE
n 1998 the number of cats in the United States was estimated to be approx-
imately 70.9 million; cats were found in 34 percent of the 100 million U.S.
pun an un sop jo raqunu an sasedns mou ansg su 'spiouasnoy 
States, approximately 57.6 million in 38.1 percent of households (www.petfood-
institute.org, Pet Food Institute, Washington, D.C.). For 1985 in Canada, the

dogs, 3,028,100. Nearly 23 percent of households in the United Kingdom have at
least one cat, and in Australia about 35 percent of the households each have one
cat or more. This love for the cat, however, is not restricted to predominantly
English-speaking countries. Between 1980 and 1990, the cat populations of
almost all European nations increased—in some cases dramatically—to the
extent that cat populations are currently level with those of the dog. Among Euro-
peans, the Swiss are dedicated cat lovers, preferring to own cats rather than dogs.
The French and the Belgians are well-known for their love of both cats and dogs.
Among nations surveyed regarding the presence of cats in households, the Japan-
ese have the least number, with a little over 5 percent with cats in 1990. However,
there are more and more households with cats all the time in Southeast Asia, espe-
cially in countries such as Taiwan and Malaysia. Regardless of national bound-
ary, with the ever-increasing limitations of time, money, and space, the cat is rap-
idly becoming the cosmopolitan pet of the twenty-first century.
Awareness of cats as something other than "small dogs" has also emerged
among cat owners and veterinarians as is evidenced by the increasing number of
Europe. For 1999, the number of members in the American Association of Feline
Practitioners and the Academy of Medicine was 1,550, of which 33.5 percent
(520) dealt exclusively with cats (Kristi Kruse Thomson, American Association
of Feline Practitioners, Nashville, Tennessee). One way in which cats differ from
dogs is in their parasitic infections and infestations. Although dogs and cats do
share a few parasites, the vast majority of the parasites of these pets are actually
specific to either dogs or cats, not to both. Also, even those parasites that are
shared between cats and dogs will often cause different host responses when par-
asitizing the cat and often require different treatment regimens.
The purpose of this book is to offer an in-depth examination of feline parasites.
Topics discussed include parasite identification, history, geographic distribution,
pathogenesis, epizootiology, zoonosis if applicable, diagnosis, treatment, control,
and prevention. The authors have attempted to produce a book that is intema-

text would prove useful to veterinarians in other countries.
a an p  a  on ra a  yo s n u si 
 nary parasitologist. It includes concise and in-depth knowledge that is useful to
both groups. Overall, the ultimate goal of this book is to improve the health of
cats around the world by providing a ready reference text that can be used to
assist (1) in diagnosing parasitic infections or infestations and (2) in treating cats
and kittens that host these parasites.
The parasites of the cats fall into four major groups: the common cosmopoli-
tan parasites, the parasites that are important in only certain geographic areas,
those that are rare and show up in rather large numbers in certain countries or cer-
tain foci, and those that tend to be rare or incidental findings where cats are serv-
 ing as atypical hosts of some adult form that is usually found in the local wildlife.
We have tried to include all these parasites in the text with the hope that it would
help practitioners develop a better understanding of the scope of parasites around
the world. Thus, there are a lot of species in the text that have appeared only once
in cats or only in very limited geographical areas. Also, we are aware that we are
also dealing with a number of parasites with which we do not actually have first-
hand knowledge. We do believe, however, that the book will serve to stimulate
individuals to consider the parasites of cats in more detail so that new informa-
tion and corrections can be added to future editions.
There are many individuals that need to be thanked in the production of this
text. Dr. J. Ralph Lichtenfels and Patricia A. Pilitt at the U.S. National Parasite
Collection, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service,
Biosystematics and National Parasite Collection Unit, require special thanks for
their assistance in making the specimens of myriad trematodes from cats avail-
able for photography. There have been many individuals that have helped in the
collection of the numerous references that were used to produce the text, with
special thanks going to Dr. Megan Williams. Michael Porch assisted with many
of the photographs of trematodes. Elizabeth A. Fogarty is thanked for her able
assistance with all aspects of the book's final assembly, help with the generation
of the final digitized images, and the production of the maps detailing geographic
distribution. Vanessa Nicolle Bowman was a great help when the format for all
the maps had to be changed for the final generation of the text. The line drawings
of the life cycle of the cat flea and the life cycle of Cuterebra were generated by
 Dr. Laurie Duffield. The book has been a long time coming, and thanks go out to
the original editor, Caroll C. Cann, who has since retired. The editor who helped
with the actual rendition of the book that has gone to press is Lynne Bishop, and
without her help this text may never have been completed. Colleagues who have
been especially helpful in the generation of the text include Dr. de Lahunta, who
has kept us honest relative to the neurology sections of the text, Dr. Robert Foley,
who has always been helpful with practical information relative to mite infesta-
tions in cats, and Dr. William Hombuckle for his assistance with day-to-day
answers to questions.

Life Cycle
Most members of the cat family Felidae are prob-
ably suitable definitive hosts. Levine and Ivens
(1981) indicated the following were suitable
definitive hosts: European wild cat (Felis sil-
vestris), ocelot (Felis pardalis), serval (Felis ser-
val), tiger (Leo tigris), lion (Felis leo), jaguar (Leo
onca), and lynx (Lynx lynx). Oocysts are excreted
unsporulated. Oocyst sporulate in 40 hours at
20°℃, 24 hours at 25°℃, 12 hours at 30°C, and
8 hours at 38°C (Shah, 1970b). Sporulation does
 not occur at temperatures above 45°℃.
Several authors have described portions of the
endogenous life cycle of Isospora felis in cats
(Wenyon, 1923; Hitchcock, 1955; Shah, 1971;
Ferguson et al., 1980a, 1980b; Daly and Markus,
1981). Sporozoites excyst from Isospora felis
oocysts in the small intestine. Developmental
stages are located in enterocytes of the distal
portions of the villi in the ileum, and rarely the
 duodenum and jejunum. The first developmental
cycle is probably by endodyogeny, and at least
three structural types of meronts are produced

Toxoplasma
gondii oocysts are spherical to subspherical, and
contain a single mass (sporont) (Fig. 1.8). Sporula-
tion occurs in the environment and is dependent on
temperature and moisture (Dubey et al., 1970a).
Sporulation is asynchronous, and some oocysts will
be sporulated before others. Completely infectious
 0ocysts are present by 24 hours at 25°C (room tem-
perature); by 5 days at 15°C, and by 21 days at
11°℃ (Dubey et al., 1970b). Unsporulated o0cysts
do not survive freezing but can remain viable at 4°C
for several months and become infectious if placed
umder the appropriate conditions. Unsporulated
00cysts die if kept at 37°℃ for 24 hours and are
killed by 10-minute exposure to 50°℃.
 A small population of unsporulated oocysts can
survive anaerobic conditions for 30 days and

iron hematoxylin and photographed using phase
microscopy.
Examination of diarrheic feces for cysts is often
mconclusive because only trophozoites are found in
stools of this type. In human medicine, fixed fecal
smears are often prepared and stained with iron
hematoxylin or by using a trichrome staining
method for the examination of protozoa. The major
reason for the examination of fixed smears of
human feces is the many kinds of protozoa that must
be differentiated. Few fecal protozoans are present
 in cats, and it is typically not necessary to perfonm
such procedures. Fixed fecal samples do have the
advantage, however, of producing a permanent slide
that can be examined at a later date.
Another method now used routinely is the
detection of Giardia in fecal smears using fluo-
rescein-conjugated antibodies to Giardia and sub-
sequent examination under a fluorescence micro-
scope. This method increases the likelihood of
finding the trophozoites and cysts because they
will fluoresce when examined, but the equipment
is costly, and other procedures are still required to

64/ FELINE CLINICAL PARASITOLOGY
At least two studies have been performed in
which cats have been experimentally infected
(Choudhury and Misra, 1972; Scheidle, 1982). In
the earlier report, cats were inoculated intraperi-
toneally. The trypanosomes appeared in the circu-
lation 14 to 15 days after infection. Young cats
could succumb during the first peak parasitemia,
but if they survived, 4-day-long peaks of para-
sitemia appeared every 2 weeks. During the peak
parasitemias, the cats showed signs of drowsi-
ness, lack of appetite, and facial inflammation. In
the later report, three cats were inoculated with
1,500 trypanosomes. Two days after infection,

and Pathogenesis
There have been a few reports of cutaneous leish-

(1986) reported on lesions in the ear of a 4-year-
old long-haired domestic cat in Texas. The cat
had no signs of systemic disease and was returmed
to its owners after a radical pinmectomy. Three
other cats (one male and two females) were found
to have lesions in Venezuela (Bonfante-Garrido et
al., 1991). On the male cat, the lesions occurred
on the nose and ears; on the female cats lesions
were confined to the nose. In all cases, organisms

2/ THETREMATODES 91
Parasite Identification
These are very small trematodes that are 1.5 to 2
mm long and about twice as long as they are
wide. The small oral sucker, about 100 μm in
diameter, is similar in size to the ventral sucker.
The ventral sucker is located at midbody, and just
behind the ventral sucker is the circular tribocytic
organ that is about one-third of the body's width.
The sexual organs are located posterior to the
ventral sucker, and there is a small elongation of
the posterior end of the body.
The oval eggs are large, yellowish-brown, oper-
culate, 100 μm long by 60 to 70 μm wide, and not
embryonated when they leave the fluke. (The eggs
are embryonated according to Fahmy et al., 1984.)
Life Cycle
The life cycle of Mesostephanus milvi has not
been elucidated. The life cycle of another cyatho-
cotylid, Prohemistomum vivax, has been investi-
gated (see below).

DIPLOSTOMATIDAE
Another group of trematodes found in the small
intestine of cats is the diplostomatids; adult
diplostomatids occur in the intestine of birds and
mammals. These trematodes are similar to the
cyathocotylids in that they possess a tribocytic
organ. However, they are typically divided into a
marked forebody and hindbody. Cyathocotylids
 also possess an organ called the cirrus sac that is

This parasite was found in 7 of 48 Egyptian cats;
Dubois (1936).
in the same study, it was found in two of three
dogs (Kuntz and Chandler, 1956). A very similar
parasite, Diplostomum tregenna, was reported
from 5 percent of dogs in Cairo (Azim, 1938),
and this may be the same parasite.
Hazards to Other Animals
None. Although other hosts are infected, the
major means of infection is through the ingestion
of the intermediate host, which requires that the
appropriate snail also be available.
Hazards to Humans
None.
Control/Prevention
It is not known what intenmediate host harbors the

ECHINOSTOMATIDAE
Another group of trematodes parasitic in the small
intestine of cats are the echinostomatids. Echinos-
tomes are characterized by the possession of a
 group of large spines around the oral sucker. Sev-
eral genera have been reported from cats. Typi-
cally, animals become infected with echinostomes
by the ingestion of fish containing metacercariae.

the possession of bodies that are wider than they

having an elongate body, by the uterus extending
all the way to the posterior of the body, and by rel-

 that project into the genital opening.

Parasite Identification
The posterior end of the body is wider than the ante-
rior. The entire body is covered with small spines.
Pygidiopsis has two symmetrical testes and a single
gonotyl. The worm is 0.4 to 0.7 mm long and 0.2 to
04 mm wide. The body is covered with small
spines, and 16 larger spines surround the mouth.
The eggs are 18 to 22 μum long by 9 to 12 μm wide.

Location in Host
Small intestine, mainly the terminal portion of the
intestinal tract (Taraschewski, 1987).
Parasite Identification
Specimens of Heterophyes aequalis are character-
ized by having a few, 15 to 35, rodlets surrounding
the genital sucker versus the 50 to 80 digitate
rodlets present on that of Heterophyes heterophyes.
The flukes from cats range in length from 0.5 to
1.4 (rarely 1.6) mm with a width of 0.25 to 0.5
mm. The ventral sucker is typically 0.06 to 0.18
mm in diameter. The yellowish brown-shelled
eggs are 23-25 μm long by 14-16 μm wide.

the right of the midline of the body. The testes are
close together at the posterior of the body where
one is slightly anteriad to the other. The ventral
sucker is larger than the oral sucker. The adults of
Metagonimus yokogawai are 1 to 1.5 mm long
with eggs that are 26 to 28 μum by 15 to 17 μm.
Life Cycle
The miracidium within the egg, like that of Het-
erophyes heterophyes, does not hatch upon contact
with water but, rather, only after it is infected by
the appropriate freshwater snail (e.g., Semisul-
cospira libertina). The cercariae that are produced
have long tails with thin dorso-ventral tail fins.
The cercariae infect fish between the scales, and
metacercariae develop predominantly within the
muscles. Freshwater fish that have been shown to

Clinical Presentation
Geographic Distribution
and Pathogenesis
Shallow ulcers may be present in the mucosa of the
jejunum where parasites live within the villus
epithelium. There is a shortening of the villus length
and adhesions formed between villi. During the first
5 to 15 days after infection, there is a decrease in the
number of goblet cells present in the areas around
the trematodes; this number then retums to normal
levels (Kim et al., 1983). Heavy infestations are
likely to cause small-bowel diarrhea.

Microphalloides vajrasthirae
Waikagul, 1983
This trematode was recovered from a cat from a
province in Central Thailand (Waikagul, 1983).
This small fluke is about 0.75 mm long and just
slightly narrower than it is long. The anterior end
is gently rounded, while the posterior end is
rather square. The testes are in the posterior part
of the body where they are found to be widely
spaced at the lateral margins of the body. The
eggs are small, being only about 20 μm long. It is
suspected, based on work performed by others
with related species, that the cat became infected
by the ingestion of a crab containing the metacer-
carial stages.

and vomiting with marked jaundice. At necropsy,
severe jaundice was obvious, and the liver was a

The characters differentiating the seven genera
are as follows. The genus Amphimerus differs
from the genus Opisthorchis in that the vitellaria
are divided into an anterior and posterior group
with the posterior group extending into the poste-
rior portion of the body to the level of the poste-
rior testis. Also, in the genus Amphimerus, unlike
in the genera Clonorchis and Opisthorchis, the
ventral sucker is larger than the oral sucker. The
 genus Clonorchis is characterized by having
testes that are highly branched. The vitellaria of
this trematode are restricted to the sides of the

Thegenus
Opisthorchis is very similar to Clonorchis, but
differs in that the testes are not branched. The
 genus Paropisthorchis is characterized by having
the ventral sucker and genital pore located on a
pedunculated structure that extends out from the
ventral surface of the body. Specimens of

Opisthorchis felineus is found in Siberia, areas

in Russia.
Location in Host
Gallbladder and bile ducts; occasionally in the

Parasite Identification
Opisthorchis felineus is similar to Clonorchis
sinensis, the most obvious difference is the differ-
ence in the amount of branching of the testes.
Those of Clonorchis are highly branched, while
those of Opisthorchis are lobed. The adults of
Opisthorchis felineus differ from those of
Opisthorchis viverrini mainly in larval develop-
ment and morphology; however, the eggs of
Opisthorchis felineus are 30 by 11 μm, while

Opisthorchis chabaudi
Bourgat and Kulo, 1977
Opisthorchis chabaudi was described from
specimens collected from an experimentally
infected cat in Togo, Africa (Bourgat, 1977).
The cats were infected with metacercariae from
frogs that had been experimentally infected
with cercariae from naturally infected snails.
The typical definitive host of this parasite in
Togo is not known.

Metorchis in that the vitelline glands on both
sides of the body become confluent anterior to the

Adult flukes measure from 5 to 7 mm in length
with widths of 1.5 to 2 mm. The oral sucker is
about the same size as the ventral sucker. The

2/ THE TREMATODES 169
Hazards to Other Animals
If mammals ingest the infected crab, there is a
possibility that larval flukes will penetrate the
intestinal wall and migrate into the abdominal
cavity. In permissive hosts, the flukes will go on
to develop in the lungs, while in other hosts the
flukes will persist in the abdominal cavity as in
the swine paratenic host. In all these hosts, there
is the possibility for associated pathology.
Hazards to Humans
Human outbreaks have occurred with this infec-
tion due to the ingestion of raw or inadequately
cooked crabs. The first known outbreak of infec-
tion with this parasite occurred in 1974 and was
characterized by a large number of patients who
had signs of fluke infection within the pleural
cavity without eggs being present in the sputum.

 Overall appear to be a little longer and a little
more slender than specimens of Paragonimus
westermani. The major distinguishing character-
istic between the adults of these two species,
which both have single spines on the body sur-
face, is the finer branching of the ovary in Parag-
onimus kellicotti. The metacercariae of these two
flukes also differ; the metacercariae of Parago-
nimus kellicotti have a thin intemal cyst wall.

within the lymphatic system. Ultimately, first-

Life Cycle
Within15 minutes toanhour after aSchistosoma
japonicum egg enters fresh water, the developed
miracidium hatches from the eggshell. The
released miracidium then penetrates a snail of the
genus Oncomelania. Within the snail, the

1986), India (Chandler, 1925), Japan (Tanaka et
al., 1985), Philippines (Tongson and San Pablo,
1979), and Chile (Torres et al., 1990).
Location in Host
Diphyllobothrium latum adults are found in the
small intestine of the cat. "The function of the
scolex is to anchor the early strobila to the host
gut wall. In the older worm, maintenance of posi-
tion in the host gut is effected by muscular tonus,
by pressure of the powerfully muscular strobila
against the gut wall; the scolex serves little pur-
pose, adheres only loosely to the gut wall, and
any increase in its size and development is not to
be expected.' (Wardle and Green, 1941).
Parasite Identification
Diphyllobothrium latum is referred to as a diphyl-
lobothrid tapeworm or as a pseudophyllidean

scolex of Diphyllobothrium latum lacks hooks
and suckers but instead possesses two shallow,
longitudinal grooves called bothria (Khalil et al.

3/ THE CESTODES 187
Life Cycle
Humans serve as the principal definitive hosts for
Diphyllobothrium latum, although many other
mammals that eat freshwater fish (e.g., the cat,
dog, bear, and pig) may harbor the adult cestodes.
In areas where human infection is rare or no
longer present, infection of the fish intermediate
hosts also becomes reduced or disappears, sug-
gesting that wild mammalian hosts are not suffi-
cient to maintain the cycle in many environments
(Beaver et al., 1984). However, in areas of Russia
where the infection is endemic, up to 90 percent
of cats may be infected (Shamarina et al., 1980).
Unembryonated eggs pass through the uterine
pore of each of the adult cestode's gravid proglot-
tids. The eggs are discharged to the external envi-
ronment with the feces. In fresh water, the first
developmental stage, the ciliated coracidium,
emerges from the egg and is eaten by the first
intermediate host, an aquatic copepod (a crus-
tacean). This copepod may be of the genera
Cyclops or Diaptomus. The second developmen-
tal stage, the worm-like procercoid stage, devel-
 ops within the copepod. When the procercoid is
 ingested by the second intermediate host (e.g., a
fish such as a freshwater fish), the procercoid

ture of the fish.
Cats become infected with Diphyllobothrium
latum by eating the fish, and the plerocercoid
develops to a mature tapeworm in the small intes-
tine. Examination of the intestines of a kitten 13
hours after being fed plerocercoids recovered
from fish revealed the worms at distances of
7, 11, 12, 13, and 16 inches from the pylorus in
a gut measuring 33 inches between pylorus and
ileocecal valve; after 25 hours in another kitten,
17 worms were found between 7.5 and 36 inches
behind the pylorus in a gut measuring 56 inches
from pylorus to ileocecal valve (Wardle, 1933). In
dogs, the first eggs are passed between 18 and 20
days after ingestion of the plerocercoid, and in
some dogs, worms are a meter and a half long by
30 days after infection is initiated (Wardle and
Green, 1941). In human beings, the worms may

and medial reproductive openings. However,
although the characteristics defining the genus
have never been questioned, no criteria to define
species have emerged as readily acceptable to
most workers in this field. Thus, numerous
species began to appear in the literature. In 1932,
Witenberg, in a review of the genus, recognized
only one species, Mesocestoides lineatus, and he
discounted or synonymized 24 described species.
Other workers (e.g., Chandler, 1942a, 1944; Cior-
dia, 1955; Voge, 1955; Grundmann, 1956) have
created other species for specimens recovered
from mammals, but it is difficult to ascertain what

Life Cycle
The adult cestode sheds segments that are passed
in the feces. Loos-Frank (1987) described the
behavior of the proglottids shed in the feces and
noted that "Gravid proglottids have a conspicuous
behavior. On freshly produced feces they stand
more or less upright and make slow waving
movements with their elongated anterior part.
After a few minutes they start crawling away
from the feces and in moist conditions can be
found quite a distance away from the pellets. In a
meadow they were observed on grasses all around
freshly deposited feces of a wild fox.'’ She also
described the fact that the strobilae of Mesoces-
toides lineatus,like those of Spirometra man-
sonoides, are often shed from worms in a host in
a relatively cyclical manner wherein they may be
shed for a month and then no segments are shed
during the next month. Examination of the ani-

causing the populations of worms present to
become markedly shortened. This is supported by
the observations of Witenberg (1932) that there
were often cestodes of varying stages of maturity
recovered from infected animals.
The host of the development of the presumed
first-stage larval form of Mesocestoides lineatus

Dipylidium caninum is by far the most common
tapewonm of cats in North America (Flick, 1973;
Hitchcock, 1953; Lillis, 1967) and perhaps
ably the only species in the genus.’ He then goes

into the scolex (Figs. 3.15 and 3.16) (Witenberg.

15 to 70 cm and be 2 to 3 mm wide with a white
to a light reddish yellow color.The body is com-

eggs to escape. Because of these bilateral genital
pores, Dipylidium caninum is often referred to as
within each proglottid until the proglottid
becomes packed like a ripe seed pod (Georgi.
1987). Gravid proglottids are creamy white, are
10 to 12 mm in length, and resemble cucumber
seeds. Hence, Dipylidium caninum is also
referred to as the "cucumber seed tapeworm"
(Griffiths, 1978). Gravid tapeworm proglottids
(Fig 3.18) are filled to capacity with egg capsules

Tostellum everted.
 The terminal tapewonm proglottids are often
passed singly in the feces (Griffiths, 1978). Since
the tapeworm proglottids possess both circular
and longitudinal smooth musculature (Chitwood
and Lichtenfels, 1973), they have the ability to
208/ FELINE CLINICAL PARASITOLOGY
move about the cat's perianal region, on the feces,
on the bedding, or across any surface where they
may be deposited (Griffiths, 1978). These
proglottids will desiccate in the extermal environ-
ment. As they lose moisture, they shrivel up, often
resembling uncooked rice grains (Boreham and
Boreham, 1990).
Life Cycle
 Due to its common occurrence, the life cycle of
Dipylidium caninum is perhaps recounted by vet-
erinarians more than any other parasite. As men-
tioned previously, the hermaphroditic adult para
site is found attached in the small intestine of the
feline definitive host. The gravid terminal seg-
ments are passed in the feces of the cat. The lar-
val stages of the cat flea (Ctenocephalides felis)
savor these segments and will actively descend
upon a freshly passed proglottid to eat it (Pugh.
1987). The flea larva has mandibulate mouth
parts that allow it to ingest the eggs of Dipylidium
caninum. The adult flea, however, is not able to
ingest these proglottids due to its siphon-like
mouth parts that restrict it to a totally liquid diet
Larvae of Ctenocephalides canis, Pulex irritans,
and the dog louse, Trichodectes canis, are also
capable of serving as intermediate hosts for Dipy-
lidiumcaninum.
Within the intermediate host, the hexacanth
embryo develops into a tailless cysticercoid. This
is the stage that is infective to the feline definitive
host. The ambient temperature determines the

rate of development of the larval tapeworm. The
flea becomes infected as a larva; however, the
hexacanth embryo does not develop to an infec-
tive cysticercoid until the adult flea has emerged
from its pupal case. In response to the host's body
temperature, development is completed to the
infective cysticercoid stage (Pugh, 1987). The
flea may contain an average of 10 cysticercoids
(range 2 to 82). The cat becomes infected by
ingesting the flea during the grooming process.
Venard (1938) experimentally infected a cat
with fleas infected with Dipylidium caninum. He
recovered tapeworms from the cat 23 days later.

228 / FELINE CLINICAL PARASITOLOCY
there are typically very few numbers of segments
(ranges between two and seven in the strobilae)
in these different species. The typical Echinococ-
cus multilocularis has two rows of taeniid (claw-
hammer-shaped) hooks on the scolex. The first
row of hooks measures 25 to 34 μm in length, and
the small hooks in the second row measure 20 to
31 μm in length. The body typically has two to
six, although commonly five, segments. The total
length of the body is typically 1.2 to 4.5 mm. The
opening of the genital pore tends to be anterior to
the middle of each segment.
There are three species of Echinococcus from
which Echinococcus multilocularis needs to be
differentiated. It appears that Echinococcus gran-
ulosus does not develop to the adult stage in the
cat; thus, it is not expected that this species will
be recovered from cats. However, the genital
opening in Echinococcus granulosus is posterior
to the middle of each segment in the gravid
proglottid. Echinococcus oligarthus (Fig. 3.35)
has been reported from wild felids in South and
Central America and could perhaps develop in
cats. The hooks on the scolex of Echinococcus
oligarthus range from 28 to 60 μm in length, or
about twice the size of those in Echinococcus
multilocularis. Also Echinococcus vogeli in

Strongyloides Species
The genus Strongyloides is composed of small
parasitic worms with parthenogenetic adult
females that live within the mucosa of the intes-
tinal epithelium of their hosts. The parasitic
中
stages are characterized by the possession of a
muscular esophagus that is about one-third of
the length of the body; this type of esophagus is
called a filarifonm esophagus. The parasitic
females fall into two major groups, (1) those with
ovaries that simply fold over at their distal ends
sasa aonpoid geui pue adeus uid-jeq e aonpoid o
that hatch before they leave the intestine and
(2) those with ovaries that distally spiral around
the intestine and that produce eggs that are
passed in the feces (Little, 1966). For species of
both types of Strongyloides, there are also free-
living stages that do not resemble the adults in
that they appear to be shorter and stockier. These

hatch from the eggs develop through four feed-
ing larval stages to produce free-living adult
males and females. The free-living adults pro-
duce eggs that hatch, and typically rhabditiform
first- and second-stage larvae develop into infec-
tive filariform third-stage larvae. On rare occa-
sions the free-living cycle may repeat itself one
more time. Infective filariform larvae also can
develop directly from the stages passed in the
feces of the host. When the cycle involves the
development of free-living stages, it is termed
a heterogonic cycle. When the cycle involves
the direct development of infective larvae, it is

Geographic Distribution
Parasite Identification
The adults of Uncinaria stenocephala are 3 mm
to 12 mm in length. They can be distinguished
from the other hookworms found in the cat by the
presence of cutting plates within the buccal cap-
sule, as opposed to the teeth that are present in
species of Ancylostoma (Fig. 4.18). The eggs of
this worm can also be differentiated from those
of Ancylostoma by their larger sites. The eggs of

Application of larvae to the skin results in lower
infection rates. After larvae are applied to the
skin, the larvae migrate to the lungs before reen-
tering the gastrointestinal tract through the tra-
chea and esophagus. The prepatent period follow-
ing percutaneous infection is 15 to 17 days.
Transplacental and transmammary transmis-
sions apparently do not occur with Uncinaria
stenocephala (Mihatsch, 1984). The infection of 
two bitches, each with 20,000 larvae at the time
of conception, failed to induce infection in the
puppies produced by the pregnancies. The infec-
tion of four bitches with 20,000 larvae at the time
of whelping also failed to produce infection in
the nursing pups. The necropsies of these bitches
28 days after infection revealed adult Uncinaria

METASTRONGVLOIDEA
Metastrongyloid nematodes are characterized by
having life cycles that typically require an interme-
diated molluscan host for the development of the
third-stage larvae that are infective to vertebrates.
Cats do not appear to eat many snails and typically
acquire their infections with these worms through
the ingestion of paratenic hosts (e.g., small birds
or rodents). The majority of metastrongyles are
associated with lung tissue, although the adults are

 Occurs near the anus. The males are smaller, being
4 to 6 mm long, and have a small bursa and rela-
tively short and stout spicules. The wonms are less
than a millimeter wide and have a dark brown to
black appearance when observed in fresh tissue.
Due to the small worms being deeply within the
terminal  respiratory bronchioles and alveolar
ducts, it is difficult to remove entire wonms by dis-
section. The females lay eggs that contain single
cells and that embryonate within the alveolar
ducts and the surrounding alveoli. The larvae
hatch from the eggs and then are carried up the cil-
iary escalator, swallowed, and passed in the feces.
The larvae of Aelurostrongylus abstrusus are quite

Life Cycle
The life cycle of Aelurostrongylus abstrusus has
been shown to involve a required snail intermedi-
ate host (Hamilton and McCaw, 1967). It has also
been shown that mice that ingest the infected
snails can serve as paratenic hosts (Mackerras,
1957). Hobmaier and Hobmaier (1935a) also
showed that if the larvae from snails were fed to
frogs, toads, snakes, lizards, ducklings, chickens,
Or sparrows, the larvae could later be recovered
from their tissues. Thus, it seems highly possible
that cats become infected typically by the inges-
tion of infected mice or birds. Stockdale (1970)

In 1988, Parsons et al. described a case of dis-
seminated granulomatous disease in a cat that
was caused by the larvae of the dog roundwonm,
Toxocara canis (Fig.4.46).The larvae were iden-
tified on the basis of morphology, being greater in
diameter than the 17 μm of the larvae of Toxocara
cati when they appear in tissues. This cat had
been housed for 19 days in the research facilities
of the School of Veterinary Medicine in Madison,
Wisconsin, and had been considered normal
except for being noted as pyrexic throughout the
19-day period. At necropsy, the cat was foumd to
have well-delineated, raised, gray-to-white nod-
ules that were up to 4 mm in diameter within the
cortical parenchyma of the kidneys and within the
epicardium and myocardium of both ventricles

Sprent and Barrett (1964) summarized much of

in cats up to that time. It had been reported in
1 percent to 5 percent of cats from North Amer-
ica, 2 percent to 20.5 percent of cats in Europe,
and 11 percent of cats in Ceylon. In 1996, 82 per-
cent of farm cats in Oxfordshire in the United
Kingdom were reported to be shedding eggs of 
this parasite (Yamaguchi et al., 1996); Nichol
(1981) found only 1.1 percent of 92 feral cats in
London to be infected with Toxascaris leonina. In
Scotland (McColm and Hutchison, 1980), 3 of
72 stray cats were found to harbor infections with
Toxascaris leonina. In Belgium (Vanparijs et al.,

eggs did not appear in the feces until 74 days after
 infection. Okoshi and Usui found that adults were
first present sometime between day 22 to day 48
after infection, and in their infections, the
prepatent period was 62 to 63 days. Both Sprent
and Okoshi and Usui were unable to infect cats
with eggs recovered from naturally infected dogs,
but Petrov and Borovkova (1959) had been suc-
cessful in infecting cats and dogs with eggs
recovered from foxes.
Sprent (1959) also showed that cats could be
infected with the larvae present in experimentally
infected mice. Infections with larvae in mice
proved to be less successful than with eggs. Cats
were capable of supporting larvae of both canine
and feline isolates when murine tissues contain-
ing these larvae were ingested. Okoshi and Usui
(1968) were also capable of recovering develop-
ing larvae of the canine isolates when the source
of infection was infected murine tissue.

indentation that has been termed a collar. Extend-

called interlabia, which protrude forward between
the three lips. The eggs of Lagochilascaris are the
feature that can most easily be used to distinguish
Lagochilascaris major from Lagochilascaris
minor Although the eggs are similar in size
(around 60 μm in diameter) and in general
appearance (having a thickened brown shell), the
eggs of Lagochilascaris minor have approxi-
mately 15 to 25 pits around the circumference,
while those of Lagochilascaris major have
approximately 33 to 45 pits around the circum-
ference. It appears that the collar is more apparent
on the anterior end of Lagochilascaris minor and
that the lips of Lagochilascaris minor tend to be
the same width or narrower than the collar while
those of Lagochilascaris major appear wider than
the collar.

Treatment
Infections of humans with Lagochilascaris minor
have proven refractory to treatment with
anthelmintics. In humans the lesions may persist,
and living worms may be removed from the
lesions for periods of several years. Treatment
with high doses of diethylcarbamazine has appar-
ently worked (de Leao et al., 1978) but has also
been unsuccessful (Draper, 1963). Worms were
recovered from one lesion for up to 10 years after
the first diethylcarbamazine treatment (Sprent,
1971).Thiabendazole has worked in some cases
(Oostburg, 1971) but has failed in other cases

The Dracunculoidea is a group of spirurid nema-

hosts. The adults tend to be rather long and are asso-

as copepods, although some parasites in fish use

PHYSALOPTEROIDEA
There are three genera of physalopteroid spirurid
nematodes, Physaloptera, Turgida, and Abbrevi-
ata, that have been recovered from the domestic
cat. These nematodes are usually found in the
stomachs of their vertebrate hosts, where they are

Physaloptera praeputialis has been reported from
cats around the world. In the Americas it has been
reported from the United States (Gufstafson,
1995;Levine, 1968) and the Bahamas (Clarkson
and Owen, 1959), Mexico (Zarate-Ramos et al.,
1991), Venezuela (Power, 1964), Argentina
(Santa-Cruz and Lombardero, 1987), and Brazil
(Campos et al., 1974; Ogassawara et al., 1986).
From Southeast Asia and the South Pacific, this
species has been reported from cats in Hawai
(Ash, 1962), the Philippines (Tongson and San-
Pablo, 1979), Japan (Hayasaki et al., 1982),
Malaysia (Retnasabapathy and San, 1970), and
Australia (Barton and McEwan, 1993). From

This worm was described by Railliet and Henry

become infective third-stage larvae. The larvae
present in the flies had genital systems that were
much more highly advanced than is typical of
third-stage larvae, the testes were already quite
extended, and both branches of the uterus in the
female were readily apparent. When larvae were
placed in the eyes of dogs, Kozlov found adult
males and females present by 3 weeks after infec-
tion, and a few days later, the uterus of the female
contained larvated eggs. By 55 days after infec-
tion, motile larvae were present in the vagina of
the female.

females of Cylicospirura felineus by the position
of the vulva relative to the esophago-intestinal

is located posterior to this junction; in Cyli-
cospirura felineus, it is anteriad to this junction

Diagnosis of infection is made by finding the
microfilariae in the blood using a Knott's tech-

of circulating microfilariae per milliliter of blood
can often be greater than 10,000 microfilariae per
milliliter; Denham et al. (1972) found that there
were around 2 to 10 microfilariae per microliter of

The adult males of Brugia malayi are 13 to 23 mm

(Buckley and Edeson, 1956). The adults of Brugia
malayi are most easily recognized by the male
spicules: those of Brugia malayi are the longest,
those of Brugia patei are intermediate in length,

female and 41 male cats that were experimentally
infected, microfilariae appeared in the blood of 
about 90 percent of all these cats (92 percent of
the females and 88 percent of the males).
In cats infected with third-stage infective larvae
from mosquitoes, the prepatent period ranged
from 80 to 96 days (Edeson and Buckley, 1959;

the regional lymph glands and vessels within 16
hours, and typically, as also shown by Ewert
(1971), the site of adult development was typi-
cally related to the site of inoculation. The molt
from third stage to fourth stage occurred about 10
days after the cats were infected, and the molt to
the adult stage took place 35 to 40 days after
infection. Ewert and Bosworth (1975) described
the results of experimentally exposing cats to a

the female within the tracts they have made in the
mucosa, and the eggs slowly work their way to
the surface. The eggs are then coughed up and
swallowed to be passed in the feces. Once eggs
are deposited on the soil, they take about 40 days
to become infectious.

Butterworth and Beverley-Burton (1980) found
that the worms lived within the gastric mucosa
and were easiest to identify in tissues when the
mucosal surface was washed with 1 percent aque-
ous methylene blue, which gave the tissues a light
blue appearance and made the unstained worms
easier to visualize.
Parasite Identification
Particular morphologic details of adult Aon
chotheca putorii are influenced by the definitive
hosts that they parasitize. In the feline, the male
stomach capillarids range in size from 2.52 to

size from 3.46 to 7.40 mm (average 5.04 mm).

Etymology
The genus name Trichuris, which may be trans-
lated as "hair tail," is actually a misnomer. A more
appropriate name is Trichocephalus or Tricho-
cephalos ("hair head"), nomenclature that has
been employed in Russia and in certain countries
of eastem Europe.
History
In 1851, Diesing described a species of Tricho-
cephalus (Trichuris) from a tiger-cat in Brazil. He
named the parasite Trichocephalus felis; however,

The range of Ornithodoros talaje extends from
Califormia and Kansas to Argentina. In the United
States, it is known to be from Califormia, Arizona,
Nevada, Kansas, Texas, and Florida. This tick has
been reported from the "hot country" of Mexico
and has been found on the peninsula of Yucatan,
Campeche, Tabasco, Chiapas, and the isthmus
and state of Veracruz and extending along the
Gulf Coast toward Texas; on the Pacific Coast the
species has not been found except to the north in
the region of the isthmus (Cooley and Kohls,

Epizootiology
Little is known about the epizootiology of this
parasite relative to its association with the cat.
Cats probably come into contact with the nymphs
at either the burrows used by rabbits or by direct
contact with infested rabbits.
Hazards to Other Animals
Other than the single report from the cat, the only
known hosts for Otobius lagophilus are cottontail
rabbits and jackrabbits (Cooley and Kohls, 1944).

Farrow, 1991). According to the Veterinary Med-
ical Data Base, West Lafayette, Indiana, no cases
of tick paralysis in the feline have been docu-
mented from the reporting member institutions
(colleges/schools of veterinary medicine) across
North America; however, a single case of tick
paralysis due to an engorged female tick of the
genus Dermacentor has been reported from a cat
in Georgia (Anderson, 1985).
However, tick paralysis due to an Australian
tick, Ixodes holocyclus, presents as a far more
harmful syndrome than that produced by its
North American counterpart (Malik and Farrow,
1991). Ixodes holocyclus, which is indigenous to
Australia, was first described by Captain W. H.

Most cases associated with pets are found in cats
or dogs that have access to or live in recently
converted poultry houses. Clinical signs include
erythema and papulocrustous eruptions that are
intensely pruritic. These lesions are often dis-
tributed over the back and extremities (Muller

Diagnosis
Infestations with Dermanyssus gallinae are often
diagnosed by a history of contact with poultry
houses or by close examination of envirommental
conditions (e.g., eaves, air conditioners, open
windows, etc.) associated with a building that

and Pathogenesis
Two forms of feline demodicosis, localized and
generalized, are recognized (Foley, 1995). The
localized fonm typically is associated with lesions
that appear as acne or as erythematous patches
of alopecia on the eyelids, face, chin, or neck
(Fig. 5.31). The generalized form of the disease is
considered by Foley (1995) to be represented by
cats that have more than five lesion sites or more
than one affected body region. Chesney (1989)
reviewed 35 published cases of demodicosis in
cats. Cases were reported in cats between 1 to 18

tralia (Coman et al., 198 1).
Location in Host
The mites live in the ear canal of the cat. Large
numbers of mites (greater than 1,000) can be
present in each ear without any apparent mites
appearing on the surface of the feline host.
Parasite Identification
Identification is relatively simple. No other non-
burrowing mites of this large size are typically
found in the ears of the cat. The living mites
appear as small white organisms that can be seen
moving about within the ears or on swabs of
deteritus removed from the ears. The larval mites
have a length of 138-224 μm. The adult male is
274 to 362 μm in length. The ovigerous female is
between 345 to 451 μm in length (Fig. 5.35). An

material could contain living mites. Thus, it is
possible that mites can be found on the surface of
their feline host.
Sweatman (1958) fed mites maintained in vitro
detritus collected from the ears of dogs and cats,
and he was convinced that the mites were basi-
cally scavengers not requiring either blood or tis-
sue fluids from the host. The ability to complete
the entire cycle in vitro would suggest that there
is some validity in this observation. Powell et al.
(1980), on the other hand, felt that the presence of
feline antigens in mites indicated that the mites
were actively feeding on fluids or blood from
their feline host.

some cats can have what appear to be severe
lesions with significant quantities of dark ceru-
men and sometimes even blood present in their
ears but only have one or two mites. Other cats
will have very clean ear canals, almost devoid of
cerumen and detritus, and have 50 to 100 mites
present. Still other cats can be host to huge num-
bers of mites, almost 2,000 per ear, and still will
have shown very little in the way of outward
signs of infection. Over 8,500 mites have been
found at necropsy in a single auditory tube of an
infested cat (Preisler, 1985). Ears of cats with
very large numbers of mites tend to contain a
dry, waxy, parchment-like material that occurs
as sheets throughout the ear canal. These sheets

react to the treatment.
Epizootiology
Mites of the genus Notoedres are found in cats,
rabbits, mice, rats, bats, and one primate (Galago
demidovi pusillus). Fain (1965) believed that the
species reported to cause notoedric mange in rab-
bits was indistinguishable from that causing dis-
ease in cats; thus, Fain synonymized the species

HEMIPTERA
Members of the Hemiptera are the "true" bugs of
entomology. The Hemiptera is a large group of
insects that contains over 50,000 species, most of
which are parasites of plants. There are some
species that are predatory and that can inflict
painful bites if handled. There are two groups that
have developed a true parasitic form of existence:
the Cimicidae (bedbugs) and the subfamily Tri-
atominae (kissing bugs) of the family Reduviidae.

History
This louse has long been known to occur on cats.
Lyal (1985) divided the genus Felicola into two
genera: Felicola (containing the subgenera Feli-
cola and Suricatoecus) and Loriscola (containing
the subgenera Loriscola and Paradoxuroecus).
Timm and Price (1994) felt that the characters
separating Felicola and Loriscola were not suffi-
cient for the differentiation of genera and consid-
ered all four subgenera within the single genus
Felicola. There are 55 species within the genus
Felicola, and within the four subgenera, Felicola,
Suricatoecus,Loriscola,and Paradoxuroecus,are
18, 11, 13, and 13 species, respectively. Of these
 55 species, 48 are from hosts of the families Fel-

Work by Genchi et al. (1992) revealed that in
northem Italy Culex pipiens was found to feed on
cats at night while both Aedes caspius and Culex
pipiens fed on dogs. Fewer total mosquitoes were
recovered each night from cats than from dogs.
This is obviously a field that requires more study
in order to understand the dynamics of feline
dirofilariasis transmission.
A direct pathogenic effect of mosquitoes to the
feline host is manifested as eosinophilic dermati-
tis (Mason and Evans,1991).This condition was
first described by workers in Australia as a sea-
sonal and intermittent condition that usually
resolved in the winter (Wilkinson and Bate,
1984).The disease has also been observed in the
 United States. The condition presents as papular
eruptions, erosions, and depigmentation of the

Psychodidae
The Psychodidae is composed of two groups of
flies: the Psychodinae and the Phlebotominae.
The Psychodinae is a group of free-living flies
that are nuisance pests that develop in dirty water
such as that found around sewage treatment
plants, manure lagoons, and cesspools. The phle-
botomine sand flies are a group of flies in which
the females require a blood meal. The genera of
flies of importance are Lutzomyia, which is found
in the Americas, and Phlebotomus and Sergento-
myia, which are found in Eurasia and Africa.
The phlebotomine flies are small flies with
 long antennae, long legs, and wings that have par-
allel wing veins that extend from the base of the
wing to the wingtip (Fig. 5.59). The mouthparts
 of the female are designed for the rasping of a
small hole in the skin from which she drinks

414/ FELINE CLINICAL PARASITOLOGY
The female lays eggs near foliage overhanging
water or at the water's edge. The larva enters the
water where, in some species, it feeds on organic
debris and, in others, it is a predator. Larvae may
remain active a year before they pupate. The pupa
occurs in drier soil, and after 1 to 2 weeks the
adult fly emerges. The adult flies are large, up to
 5 cm in length, and cause significant lesions at the
site of the bite. The major biting activity is likely
to occur during the heat of midday. Some humans
react significantly to the bites and develop large
swellings that may be up to 10 cm or more in
diameter. It is to be expected that cats are also
plagued by the bites of these flies, but specific
 cases have not been described.

The first larval stage will probably go unno-
ticed due to its small size, up to 3 mm at the time
of its molt to the second stage. The second stage
is quite similar to the third but is from 4 to 9 mm
in length. The third stage larva is a large larva,
up to 18 mm in length. The body is composed of 
12 segments that have broad encircling bands of
spinules. All three stages are "maggot-like' in
sclerites and posterior spiracles that are unique to

the larva has its spiracular plate located in a deep
cleft at the end of the eighth abdominal segment.
The spiracular plates are large and well separated.
The peritreme is wide with a break in its inferoin-
temal border. The button is situated in the break
 in the peritreme. The three breathing slits are very
wide (Patton and Evans, 1929).
The second- and third-stage larval Chrysomyia
bezziana are the stages that will be usually
observed in the skin of an infested cat by either the
owner or the veterinarian. These stages can prob-
ably be best identified by an entomologist. Exten-
sive descriptions of these morphologic stages do
exist (Patton and Evans, 1929; Zumpt, 1965).

Location in Host
The larval stages of this parasite are commonly
found in furuncular lesions in the skin of the
rodent host.In the cat,these furuncular lesions
may appear on the cheek, neck, top of the head, or
the thorax (Fischer, 1983). Larvae have also been
reported from the nasal pharynx (Thirloway,

nasopharyngeal region for 6 to 8 days (Baird,
1975; Catts, 1967), where the small, transparent
larvae are found at the posterior end of the soft
palate in the nasal passages of experimentally
infected house mice and woodrats (Neotoma
fuscipes). In these mice, the larvae remain quite
small and transparent, being only two to three
times larger than the larvae that hatch from eggs.
Work with other species of bots has shown that
there may be a migration to the area of the tra-

lays its eggs on grass, plant stems, bark, or wood chips around the entrance to a rodent burrow. After
several days, the larvae have matured and hatch from eggshells in response to increases in temperature;
some larvae can persist within the eggs for months. The hatched larvae attach to a passing host and then
enter the body of the host through an opening such as the mouth or nose. In the rodent and rabbit hosts,
the larvae migrate first to areas associated with the lungs or pharynx and then migrate to the
subcutaneous site where the larvae mature within the warble. Once the larvae have matured, they drop to
the ground where they wriggle into the soil to pupate. Typically, the pupal stage is the stage in which the 
flies overwinter, with the adults emerging from pupal cases in the spring.The most common presentation
in the cat is to have the larvae developing in a warble much like they do in the rodent or rabbit, with the
poste rior end of the bot with its large paired spiracles protruding from the opening in the warble. In the
cat, neurologic manifestations of infection can be caused by early stage larvae migrating into the spinal
cord or brain and producing lesions similar to those seen in feline ischemic encephalopathy with
appreciableasymmetry of thecerebralhemispheres.

History
Records of early exploration in Panama reveal
that Dermatobia hominis has been known as a
 human parasite in Panama for almost a century
and a half. If earlier records were available, they
would probably show that this fly had been
known by indigenous Americans for centuries
(Dumn, 1934). The natives of Central and South
America have long known animals to be infected
with larvae of Dermatobia species. The ancient
Mayans referred to this parasite as "saglacuru'"

ples were. The ancient Mayans extracted the larva
of Dermatobia by covering its breathing pore

(Prasad and Beck, 1969).
Geographic Distribution
The mature larva at 2 to 3 months of age is 1.8
to 2.4 cm in length (Fig. 5.90). It has a definite
club shape and can be identified by rows of pos-
teriorly directed spines on its anterior segments.
The larval stage also possesses caudal spiracles
that protrude through the host's skin to the exte-
rior to guarantee an adequate air supply (File
et al., 1985).
The larva of Dermatobia hominis is narrow and
tubular at its posterior extremity and somewhat
flask shaped anteriorly (Patton and Evans, 1929).

The biology of the cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis,
has been reviewed in detail in recent years as

on its biology (Rust and Dryden, 1997). Georgi

and Georgi (1992) did an excellent job of pre-
senting images that allow the easy recognition of
the species and subspecies of importance. The
adult fleas in this genus have both genal (cheek)
and pronotal (neck) combs (i.e., thick bristles that
mustache) (Fig. 5.91). Adult fleas (Fig. 5.92)
remain on their feline host if at all possible. How-
ever, some cats are excellent groomers and can
easily remove 50 to 100 fleas in a 24-hour period.
While on the cat, the adult fleas suck blood. A
large portion of the blood imbibed by the fleas
seems to pass directly through their system.
Female fleas make helixes, and males make small
spheres. In both cases, the blood passed through
