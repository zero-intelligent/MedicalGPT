To Dr. Janet Aldrich, who taught me that thinking and
knowing are different, and that the former is far
more important.
To Dr. Steve Haskins, who showed me that listening is
the teacher's most important skill.
To my parents, Robbie and Mike, who taught me that
caring is always worth it.
And to my husband Mike, who gives selflessly over
and over and over again.
I love and thank you all.
-Jamie M. Burkitt Creedon
First and foremost this book is dedicated to my
parents, Dr. Harold Davis, Sr., and Barbara Davis, and
my sister, Deborah Davis-Gillespie, for their love,
support and guidance. To Thomas J. Bulgin, DVM, for
giving me my start as a veterinary assistant and Gary
L. Reinhardt, DVM, and Steve C. Haskins, DVM,
DACVECC, for their mentorship. To each current and
past member that I have served with on the board of
directors for the Veterinary Emergency and Critical
Care Society. To the veterinary technicians and nurses
that I have talked to around the world and former
veterinary students of U.C. Davis: I have enjoyed
sharing my knowledge and experiences with you.
Finally, to the co-founding and charter members of
the Academy of Veterinary Emergency, and Critical
Care Technicians: it was an honor, pleasure, and a joy
to work with you in developing the first veterinary
technician speciality academy.

Reception area
This is the area where clients are initially received and
usually discharged. Ideally, some degree of privacy
should exist for the discharge area where financial or
sensitive communication is taking place.
Security
Emergency practices have more security concerns
 than day practices because they are open during non-
business hours and may be perceived to be rich in cash
and narcotics. To provide a safe environment for staff
 and clients, enhanced security measures should be
considered.
An alarm system can be installed in the facility that

radiographs, visual aid display, and website review can
be accomplished with fixed computers with monitors in

Some manufacturers have combined features in their

 people and equipment often needed in addressing emer-

Adequate lighting is crucial in the treatment area and

 Many different “cage" designs can be found in veterinary
ICUs today (Fig. 3.4).

is often used to enclose larger dogs. When the patient is

Ancillary rooms
Laboratory facilities
The ICU should have easy access to a laboratory facility
which supplies emergency-directed 24-hour clinical
laboratory services. When such services cannot be pro-
vided by the central hospital laboratory, a satellite labo-
ratory within the ICU must serve this function. It is
advantageous to have the laboratory facility close to the
 patient area so that technicians are never far away in case
 of an emergency in the ICU.
Af a minimum, it is ideal to have 24-hour capability

 sheet is used to document the results of "bedside" diag-

and to document that the orders have been carried out
 and at what time.'3 Flow sheets are helpful in registering
subtle trends, and as such, their design should include

both subjective and objective assessments. However,
subjective assessments are best communicated verbally
 with the attending veterinarian and others involved in
 the patient's care.

consistent protocols for procedures and techniques is
essential. The development of protocols should include

 Advanced Monitoring and Procedures for Small Animal Emergency and Critical Care
Procedure
1.
 Collect necessary supplies. If chemical restraint is necessary, allow adequate time for optimum results
 Patient should be placed in lateral recumbency with neck extended and thoracic limbs gently pulld caucally. It is
recommended that two persons restrain the animal, one ocdluding the vessel and restraining the cranial end of the patient,
the other restraining the patient's caudal end. Chemical restraint is typically not necessary.
3.
Clip a wide area of fur to avoid contamination of insertion site, at least 2-2.5 inches (at least 5 cm) around intended insertion
site.
4.
Aseptically prepare the area. Alternate deansing scrub with isopropyl alcohol; prepare in circular motions, starting from the
center and finishing at the periphery with each swab.
Perform hand hygiene and don sterile gloves.
6.
If chemical sedation or general anesthesia is not feasible, infuse lidocaine (0.2-0.5 mL) into the subcutaneous region around 
the intended insertion site.
7.
 Prepare skin with a final surgical scrub and maintain a sterile field.
8.
Sterilely drape the area cranial and caudal to insertion site 
9.
Using sterile technique, premeasure the guide wire from the intended insertion point to the third or fourth intercostal space
(ICS), with the tip of guide wire not beyond the fourth ICs. It is not necessary to premeasure the guide wire if placed via a
saphenous vessel.
10.
catheters, the ideal resting point is in the cranial vena cava at approximately the level of the 3rd-4th ICs. The tip of the
jugular catheter should rest in the cranial vena cava just cranial to the right atrium if central venous pressure monitoring is
anticipated.
11.
 Place a large-bore, short, over-the-needle catheter into the vein, with the tip pointing in the direction of the heart; ensure a
"clean" stick with adequate blood flow.
12.
Insert the straight end of the guide wire into the vessel through the over-the-needle catheter to the premeasured length
(Fig. 4.8a).
13.
Remove over-the-needle catheter; ensure that the wire does not inadvertently back out or touch a nonsterile field
14.
Insert the plastic dilator into the vessel by placing the wire through it and guiding it into the vessel. Passage of the
dilator may be facilitated by "tenting" the skin and gently rotating the dilator into the vessel (Fig. 4.8b). A cut into 
the skin with a #11 scalpel blade next to the wire may ease insertion and prevent "burring." Insert one-half the length
of the dilator into the vessel, hold for a few seconds, and then remove the dilator from the guide wire. Expect
bleeding from the insertion site, and use sterile gauze to apply pressure if needed while transitioning to the
next steps.
15.
Insert the catheter over the wire and guide it into the vessel to predetermined length (Fig. 4.8c). Ensure the end of the wire
is projecting out the distal end of the catheter before advancement; the wire should be held as the catheter is advanced into
the vessel. If multilumen catheters are used, the wire should exit the distal port. Remember to remove the cap from the distal
 port so that the wire is able to emerge. Remove the wire and leave the catheter in place.
16.
Aspirate catheter with a smallsyringe; blood should easily flow into the syringe. Flush the catheter with sterile saline and
cap port(s) with a T-port or injection plug. Repeat procedure for each port if a multilumen catheter is used. It is important
to always aspirate the catheter first, before flushing, so as not to create an air embolus, even if the catheter port(s) were 
preflushed.
If entire length of catheter is not used, secure excess catheter with plastic catheter holders provided. Secure the catheter in
place with sutures between the skin and the designated grooves or holes on the catheter hub and/or the plastic catheter
holders (Fig. 4.8d). Place a sterile dressing over the insertion site, such as a sterile cotton ball or a small sterile gauze square.

or multilumen ports onto top of the bandage for easy access (Fig. 4.8e). Ensure the bandage is not tight; several
fingers should easily slide under the bandage. Recheck patency of the catheter by aspirating blood once the bandage
is in place.

manufacture intraosseous catheters that can be used in adult patients, indluding intraosseous drills to facilitate insertion.
Procedure
1.
 Select best placement site, taking into consideration patient comfort, ease of placement, and anticipated catheter
dwell time.
 Collect necessary supplies.
2.
3.
 Closely clip a generous area (2-2.5 inches-approximately 5 cm) around the intended insertion site and remove any
loose fur.
4.
Aseptically prepare the area. Alternate deansing scrub with isopropyl alcohol; prepare in circular motions, starting from the
center and finishing at the periphery with each swab.
5.
Perform hand hygiene and don examination gloves: if the patient is immunocompromised, it is recommended to wear sterile
gloves.
6
Restrain patient; avoid excessive stress to patient.
Administer a small amount of lidocaine to the level of the periosteum.
8.
Prepare skin with a final surgical scrub and maintain a sterile field.
9
 Place a finger on the long axis of the bone in which the catheter will be placed, to determine the bone's axis and location.
10.
If using the femoral trochanteric fossa, adduct the limb slightly (toward ventral midline) and rotate trochanteric fossa laterally
to avoid the sciatic nerve.
11.
Insert the catheter distally lengthwise into the medulla of the femur or humerus cortex parallel to the finger held alongside
the bone, aiming for the trochanteric fossa if the femoral trochanteric fossa is the insertion site. Simultaneously push
and twist the needle in a single line (i.e., avoid movement in the third dimension). Expect initial resistance as the needle
passes through the cortex. If resistance is felt as the needle passes through the cortex into the medulla, the bevel of the
needle may be seated incorrectly, causing blockage. Gently tum the needle 90°-180° to dislodge and attempt placement
again.
12.
Once the needle is in place, push the hub of the needle back and forth, simultaneously moving the limb; the hub of the
needle should be seated securely in the shaft of the bone and move along with the bone when the limb is moved
13.
 Aspirate needle or catheter; aspiration of bone marrow confirms placement. A radiograph can also confirm the correct
 anatomical location
14.
 Flush gently with a small amount heparinized saline; little resistance should be felt.
15.
 Check surrounding tissue for fluid leakage: if leakage is evident, the catheter may need to be removed and another bone 
tried.
16.
Attach a T-port.
17.
 Anchor the catheter either by placing a stay suture through the skin near the catheter hub and attaching that suture to the
tubing of the T-port, or by stapling a small butterfly tape anchor from the catheter hub to the skin
18.
 Check for displacement of the catheter at least twice daily.

Unipolar precordial chest leads
The unipolar precordial chest leads require different
electrode placement than standard and augmented
leads. Unipolar precordial chest leads record the electri-
cal activity from the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the
heart. These leads allow the operator to record the elec-
trical activity of a specific cardiac region. A positive elec-
trode is placed on the chest and, as with unipolar
 augmented leads, is paired with a neutral electrode that
generates a “"v" (unipolar) lead. The neutral electrode is

Zeroing the transducer
To interpret measured pressure, it must be compared
with a known pressure standard. The standard pressure
against which direct intravascular pressure measure-

is approximately 760 mm Hg (1031 cm HO) at sea level.

1.
 Collect necessary supplies.
2.
 Plug the monitor in, turn it on, and attach the transducer-to-monitor cable to the monitor. Configure the monitor per
manufacturer's instructions to display pressure from the socket into which you have inserted the transducer-to-monitor cable.
3.
 Perform hand hygiene and don clean examination gloves.
4.
 Aseptically prepare the patient's catheter port onto which the monitoring system will be attached. Flush the patient's catheter
gently to ensure patency.
5.
Heparinize the flush solution unless the clinician instructs otherwise. Standard dilution is 1 unit heparin per milliliter of
flush. Mark the fluid bag to indicate its additives. Remove all air from the fluid bag by inserting a 22-gauge needle into
the medication port and withdrawing gas until none remains. This minimizes the risk of air embolism from the pressurized
system.
6.
 Attach a standard fluid administration set, with the roller clamp closed, to the heparinized fluid bag and squeeze the drip
chamber until it is approximately halfull. Prime the fluid line with flush using gravity flow, then reclamp the fluid line.
Handle fluid line aseptically such that the end remains sterile.
7.
 Insert the fluid bag into a pressure bag and inflate to approximately 300 mm Hg. Hang the pressurized bag and fluid line near
the patient's area.

 Place a sterile, locking injection port to the transducer's zeroing (air) port.
10.
The vented cap on a new transducer's stopcock should be thrown away, as its vents may allow contaminants to enter the
system.
11.
If blood sampling from the catheter is desired, place a stopcock between the high-pressure tubing and the catheter or
catheter's T-port. The unused port should have a sterile, locking injection port attached.
12.
Use the fast flush device on the transducer to prime the entire system until fluid drips from the end of the high-pressure
tubing. Flush slowly to avoid air bubble formation in the tubing.
13.
 Attach the monitoring system to the patient's vascular catheter or the catheter's T-port.

Procedure
Ensure the pressure bag containing the flush fluid is pressurized to 300 mm Hg.
2.
Perform hand hygiene and don clean examination gloves.
3.
Perform a square wave test during diastole by activating the transducer's fast flush device briefly (for <1 second) and quickly
releasing the device. A square wave should appear on the monitor—-print this waveform with 1-2 seconds of strip on either
side. Repeat this process 3-5 more times and collect the square waves for analysis
4.
 Evaluate the square waves to determine the system's natural frequency. The natural frequency is the frequency with which the
waveform oscillates after the fast flush device is released. For example: The paper speed in Figure 8.7 is 25 mm/sec. Note the
number of blocks between oscillation peaks—-in this case just over 2 blocks between oscillations. Divide the paper speed by
the number of blocks to determine the system's natural frequency: (25 mm/sec) ÷ (2 mm) = 12.5 cycles/sec = 12.5 Hz, which is
a minimally acceptable natural frequency for measurements in humans.
5.
Determine the frequency on all of the square waves collected, and average the values to reach the mean natural frequency.
Use this mean natural frequency in the dynamic response graphic plot (see step 8)
6.
Evaluate the square wave to determine the system's damping coefficient. This is done by comparing the length of two
successive oscillations and dividing the second (smaller) oscillation by the first (see Fig. 8.8). The number generated is
called the amplitude ratio. For example: The paper speed in Figure 8.8 is 25 mm/sec. Measure the length of two successive
oscillations (i.e., from peak to valley, and from that same valley to the next peak). Divide the smaller oscillation by the larger to
Determine the amplitude ratio on all of the square waves collected and average the values to reach the mean amplitude ratio.
Use the graph in Figure 8.9 to determine the damping coefficient from the amplitude ratio.
8.
 Use a straightedge to plot the mean natural frequency against the damping coefficient on the graph in see fig 8.5 above. If the
intersecting point falls into the gray area, the system is adequately responsive. Overdamped reacdings will fall above the gray
area and underdamped readings willfall below the gray area.
Figure 8.7 Step 4, determine system's natural frequency. Paper speed 25 mm/sec. First, note the number of blocks between oscil-

the system's natural frequency: (25 mm/sec) ÷ (2 mm) = 12.5 cycles/sec = 12.5 Hz, which is a minimally acceptable natural frequency

The corrections for overdamped and underdamped systems are similar, so the following actions can be tried in the case of either
problem.16.17
Simplify the system as much as possible to increase its natural frequency:
o Remove as many lengths of tubing between the catheter and the patient as possible such that the tubing does not exceed 
3-4 feet in length.
o Remove any unnecessary stopcocks
o Consider removing any T-ports or other connections.
 Ensure only noncompliant tubing is present between the catheter and the transducer, particularly for arterial pressure
monitoring
 Check for and remove any visible clots or air bubbles
Check tubing for kinks or occlusions.
 Gently aspirate and flush the catheter to assess for occlusion
If the catheter is <18-gauge (or 7 Fr), compliant, or long. consider replacement with a shorter, larger-bore, stiffer catheter.
If the waveform is underdamped, consider insertion of a damping device into the system.

The oscillometric  sphygmomanometry  technique is

than the Doppler ultrasonic technique. Oscillometry

Items Required
● Indwelling central venous catheter (inserted to the proper depth)
● Disposable water manometer (calibration in centimeters), or a centimeter ruler and extension tubing 
+0.9% NaCl
● Three-way stopcock with locking fittings
 20-mL syringe
●Noncompliant tubing or standard fluid extension tubing

Procedure
1.
 Collect the necessary supplies.
2.
 Perform hand hygiene and don examination gloves.
3.
 The patient may lie in lateral or sternal recumbency. This position should be recorded on the patient treatment sheet for
future reference.
If applicable and safe to do so, have the patient rest in the same position that was recorded in the treatment sheet for prior
CVP measurements.
5.
 Flush the patient's central venous catheter with heparinized saline solution to ensure patency.
6.
 Assemble the CvP monitoring setup. First orient the manometer vertically. Then connect the three-way stopcock to the
manometer, to the saline-filled syringe, and to the fluid tubing.
7.
Orient the three-way stopcock valve so that it is closed to the manometer and open to the tubing and fluid-filled syringe.
Then, prime (fil) the stopcock and fluid tubing with 0.9% NaCl from the syringe. Connect the fluid tubing to the central
venous catheter. If a multilumen catheter is being used, connect the tubing to the central lumen
8.
 Orient the stopcock valve so that it is closed to the patient's central venous catheter and open between the manometer
and the fluid-filled syringe. Using the 20-mL syringe, fill the manometer with 0.9% NaCl to a level that is approximately
10-20 cm Hz0 greater than the patient's expected CVP Do not allow the manometer to overflow while filling.
9.
 The manometer may be attached to an IV pole to facilitate height adjustments, held vertically in the operator's hand, or
taped to the wall of the cage. Locate the O cm HzO mark and position the manometer so that it is level with the zero reference
point (the patient's right atrium).
10.
 Close the stopcock valve toward the syringe, which will open a fluid column between the manometer and the patient. The
fluid level in the manometer will initially fall as it flows into the patient and then stabilize as the fluid level equilibrates with
the CVP.
11.
 The operator should ensure consistent readings by performing three or more consecutive measurements and calculating an 
average. Record the average pressure and patient position on the patient's treatment sheet.
12.
 When the measurements have been completed, turn the stopcock off to the manometer and disconnect the pressure tubing
from the central venous catheter. If intravenous fluid therapy will not be immediately resumed, flush the central venous
catheter with heparinized saline.

 The patient may lie in lateral or sternal recumbency. This position should be recorded on the patient treatment sheet for
future reference.
4.
 Flush the patient's central venous catheter with heparinized saline solution to ensure patency.
5.
 Assemble the heparinized saline flush system by spiking the heparinized saline fluid bag with the standard fluid
administration set and flushing fluid through the tubing. Clamp the tubing and cap the set's open end.
6.
 Place the pressure bag over the bag of heparinized saline, hang it on an IV pole placed next to the patient, and inflate the
pressure bag to 300 mm Hg
7.
Assemble the transducer system by connecting it to the noncompliant tubing, to the assembled heparinized saline flush
system, and to the transducer cable and electronic monitor, as shown in Figure 9.1.

Connect the pressure tubing to the central venous catheter. If using a multilumen catheter, the CvP measurement 
should be obtained from the most distal lumen, reserving the other lumens for IV fluid therapy, drug administration, or

10.
 Position the height of the transducer and stopcock system so that the stopcock is aligned at the same height as the zero
reference point (the right atrium). The transducer may be attached to an IV pole, to the cage door, or taped to a stable
support that is resting on the floor of the cage
11.
 Flush the catheter by pulling on the pigtail and wait for the pressure to equilibrate.
12.
 The system must be calibrated (zeroed) before any measurements can be interpreted. To perform zero-calibration, with the
stopcock at the height of the right atrium, tum the stopcock off toward the patient. Remove the zeroing port cap on the
stopcock to open it to the atmosphere. Select the zeroing function on the display monitor and wait for it to read O mm Hg.
Replace the zeroing port cap and turn the stopcock toward the zero port, which willallow the pressure to equilibrate

Procedure
1.
Collect necessary supplies.
2.
 Turn on the cardiac output computer and patient monitor. Input any necessary information into the computer (volume and
temperature of injectate).
3.
Spike the heparinized saline bag with the standard fluid administration set and insert into a pressure bag. Make sure the
administration set is cdamped and capped.
4.
Attach electrocardiograph(ECG)
5.
Clip and prepare with antiseptic solutions a wide area of skin over the intended vessel puncture site.

9.
 Attach distal catheter port to pressure transducer via a three-way stopcock and flush the system with heparinized saline. If 
any fluid line is inserted between the patient and the transducer, it must be noncompliant tubing.
10.
Attach continuous flush line to the transducer and pressurize the bag to ≥200 mm Hg.
11.
 Zero the pressure transducer. Zeroing information can be found in Protocol 8.2.
12.
Insert the introducer catheter per manufacturer's recommendations and suture in place.
13.
 Insert the thermodilution catheter through the introducer catheter to about 20 cm and verify that the pressure tracing reflects
a central venous pressure waveform.
14.
 Advance the catheter with the natural curve of the catheter aimed toward the sternum of the animal; watch for a typical
ventricular waveform.
15.
 If the catheter advances to the 50-cm mark without entering the right ventridle, withdraw it to the 20-cm mark and start 
again.
16.
It may help to twist the catheter, a little or a lot, in either direction, to change the chance that it might enter the right
ventridle.
17.
If the pressure tracing becomes damped, flush the distal port with the transducer's fast flush device; if the pressure tracing
abruptly ceases followed by a rapid, linear increase, the end-hole has butted up against a vessel or heart chamber wall and
 should be withdrawn slightly and then reinserted.
18.
It may help to change the position of the animal.
19.
 Once the catheter tip has entered the right ventricde, inflate the balloon with 1 ml of air and advance it further until the
pressure waveform indicates that the catheter tip has entered the pulmonary artery.
20.
With the balloon inflated, advance the catheter until the pressure tracing reflects occlusion of a branch of the pulmonary
artery; deflate the balloon and verify a good pulmonary artery tracing.

Instrumentation
Many different models of echocardiographs are cur-
rently available. Each echocardiograph can usually
be customized to the needs of the operator. However,
every echocardiographic system should include the fol-
lowing important features. First, two or three transduc-
ers covering a range of frequencies are recommended to
obtain adequate images in animals of various sizes.

The optimum site for catheter insertion must be

the site with the largest volume fluid accumulation

 Protocol 15.1 How to calculate an oxygen extraction ratio (OzER)199
Items Required
●Patient with indwelling pulmonary arterial catheter (PAC) and peripheral arterial access (catheter or direct puncture)
●Examination gloves
 Supplies to aseptically prepare catheter port(s)
Blood gas syringes—2
● Aseptically prepared 6-mL blood scavenging syringe filled with 1 ml heparinized 0.9% NaCl (two of these syringes if peripheral
arterial sample will be from a catheter)
●Pressure bandage if performing direct arteriopuncture
Procedure
1.
 Obtain arterial and mixed venous blood samples, both using the following technique:
 Prepare supplies to collect an arterial blood gas sample (arteriopuncture or via arterial catheter) and mixed venous blood
gas sample (via PAC).
b.
 Perform hand hygiene and don dlean examination gloves.
C.
Open a blood gas syringe filled with lyophilized heparin and expel air.
d.
 Suspend pressure monitoring in preparation for sample collection from a three-way stopcock.
The stopcock is turned off to the pressure transducer
e.
 Collect all samples anaerobically using aseptic technique.
g.
Slowly and gently remove (scavenge) a 3- to 6-ml presample of blood into heparinized saline solution that can be
returned to the patient through a venous catheter.
h.
The stopcock is turned off to the patient to change syringes.
Once the sample is slowly and gently obtained, excess air must be removed from the collection syringe immediately and
the sample taken to the laboratory for blood gas measurement.
Return scavenged blood via a venous catheter port.
The catheter is then flushed and pressure monitoring can continue.
Measure blood gases on both peripheral and pulmonary arterial samples as soon as possible.
2.
Calculate OER =(CaO2 - CmvO2)/Ca02:
日.
CaO, = (1.34 x Hb x Sa02) + (0.003 x Pa02) (see Note)
b.
Cmv0z = (1.34 × Hb × Smv02) + (0.003 × Pmv02) (see Note)

Some patients with bradyarrhythmias also have con-
comitant tachyarrhythmias. In this situation the clini-
 cian is faced with a dilemma, as many antiarrhythmic
drugs used to treat tachyarrhythmias can increase the
severity of the bradyarrhythmia. Prophylactic tempo-
rary pacing can prevent life-threatening bradycardia

 during implantation of a permanent pacemaker when

Items Required
● Fluoroscope or electrocardiogram [ECG] to determine location of the electrode
●2% lidocaine solution in syringe with needle
· Percutaneous introducer kit, or a suitable intravenous (IV) catheter and an access port 
● Temporary pacing lead.
● Pacing generator with fresh batteries
●Sterile scalpel, scissors, needle driver, thumb forceps
Suture
●Sterile surgical drapes
Sterile sponges
●Sterile gloves
·Bandage material
*Assistants
● Patient monitoring equipment (ECG, blood pressure monitor)
Procedure: Introducer placement
1.
Collect necessary supplies.
2.
Select insertion site, position patient appropriately, and place monitoring equipment.
Clip fur at least 5 cm (2 inches) in alldirections from planned insertion site and aseptically prepare the skin. Inject local
anesthetic agent (<0.5 ml 2% lidocaine) subcutaneously around the point of insertion.
4.
Perform hand hygiene, don sterile gloves, and drape the sterile insertion field.
5.
Use a scalpel blade to cut a small hole completely through the skin.
6.
Insert an intravenous catheter into the vein. This catheter must be large enough to allow a guide wire to pass through it.
7.
 Pass the guide wire through the intravenous catheter and into the vein. Remove the intravenous catheter while keeping the
guide wire in the vein.
8.
 Insert the tapered dilator into the sheath and pass the dilator and sheath over the guide wire.
9
Dilate the vein and insert the introducer: Push the dilator and sheath over the guide wire through the hole in the skin,
through the wall of the vein, and into the lumen of the vein. Remove the dilator and guide wire from the introducer sheath,
leaving the introducer in the vein.
10.
Suture the introducer to the skin. Check to see that there is no leakage from the port of the hemostasis valve on the
introducer.
11.
Cover the opening on the hemostasis valve to maintain sterility.

2.
Lead introduction:
a.
 If the introducer is in the jugular vein, insert the lead through the access port, jugular vein, cranial vena cava, right atrium,
tricuspid valve, and right ventridle until it contacts the right ventricular endocardium
b.
If the introducer is in the lateral saphenous vein, insert the lead through the access port, saphenous vein, femoral vein,
caudal vena cava, right atrium, tricuspid valve, and right ventricle until it contacts the right ventricular wall. Sometimes
resistance is encountered as the lead reaches the inguinal region. Abduction of the leg usually allows the lead to pass.
For bipolar leads, connect the negative terminal of the generator to the distal electrode on the lead and the positive terminal
of the generator to the proximal electrode of the lead.
4.
Set the rate on the generator and increase the strength of the stimulus until it captures the ventridle (produces a ventricular
complex on the ECG and a palpable pulse)
5.
Adjust the sensitivity to recognize intrinsic beats. Avoid setting the pacemaker so that it senses T waves, P waves, shivering. or
other artifacts that may inhibit pacing.
Secure the lead to the access port.

Oxygen cage
An oxygen cage is a good option for patients that are in
severe respiratory distress or likely to decompensate
rapidly if manually restrained. There is minimal stress
 involved and the patient can receive the benefit of oxygen
 supplementation while being visually evaluated. A com-
mercial oxygen cage environment's oxygen concentra-
tion, temperature, and humidity can be adjusted and
 monitored. The oxygen cage is a good option for longer
term use because it does not require manual application
of the oxygen but allows complete patient observation.

tion. Oxygen therapy in a cage allows the patient to
position itself comfortably (see Fig. 20.2).
Unfortunately, oxygen cages are relatively expensive
to operate, and by their nature they limit technician and
clinician access to the patient. It takes time for the cage
to fill with oxygen, and each time the cage door is
opened, the oxygen concentration in the cage drops
toward or to room air concentration. When performing
time-consuming patient treatments, a facemask may be
required to supplement oxygen while the door is open.
Most oxygen cages are too small to adequately accom-
modate large dogs without significant overheating, but
they work well for small dogs and cats. Even with tem-

7.
 Select the appropriate-size ET tube and apply sterile aqueous lubricant to the distal end, avoiding the Murphy eye.

 Advance the ET tube over the epiglottis without contact and through the arytenoids. Orient the ET tube with the bevel to the
right of the person inserting the tube (in tubes with Murphy eyes, the Murphy eye would be to the left).
9.
 The adapter should remain just cranial to the incisors on midline. Secure the tube with a length of muzzle gauze or similar
material. First tie the gauze around the ET tube near the junction of the adapter. In large dogs it should be secured around 
the muzzle behind the canines. In small dogs the gauze can be secured around the head behind the ears.

Procedure
1.
Collect necessary supplies.
Anesthetize and orotracheally intubate the patient with a cuffed ET tube.
3.
 Position the animal in dorsal recumbence with a towel rolled under the neck. Clip and aseptically prepare a large surgical
field on the ventral cervical surface.
Perform hand hygiene, and don cap, mask, and sterile gloves.
5
Isolate the prepared surgical site with a barrier drape.
6.
Make a ventral midline cervical skin incision just caudal to the larynx for a distance of approximately 3 to 4 cm.
7.
Apply a self-retaining retractor to hold open the skin edges and clear just enough subcutaneous tissue to identify the midline
division of the stemohyoideus muscles.
8.
 Using Metzenbaum scissors, bluntly separate the sternohyoideus muscles on the midline, taking care to avoid the thyroidea
caudalis vein on the midline between these two muscles. Retract the thyroidea caudalis vein to one side along with one of
the sternohyoideus musdles
9.
 Reposition the self-retaining retractors on the stemohyoideus muscles to expose the trachea and dlear the loose fascia away
at the proposed tracheotomy site. Application of a second self-retaining retractor at a right angle to the original retractor to
retract the skin in a craniocaudal direction enhances exposure.
10.
 Using a scalpel blade, incise the interannular ligament between the second and third tracheal rings. Do not incise the
interannular ligament beyond 50% of the tracheal circumference.
11.
 Place stay sutures around the second and third tracheal rings, knot the sutures to create large suture loops, and tag the
suture strands with mosquito hemostatic forceps.
12.
 Use the stay sutures to manipulate the interannular opening while the orotracheal tube is removed. Insert the tracheostomy
tube with the obturator in place, and then quickly remove the obturator and replace it with an inner cannula
13.
Leave the stay sutures in place for postoperative nursing care manipulations
14.
Secure the tracheostomy tube by attaching umbilical tape to the flange eyelets and tying the tapes behind the neck
15.
Do not suture the tracheostomy wound unless the incision was made too large. In that case, place a few interrupted sutures
in the subcutaneous tissue and/or skin to decrease the size of the wound, taking care not to make the wound too small.

Airway humidification
Humidification involves the saturation of inspired gases

of water vapor that can be carried in inspired gas depends
on temperature: warmer gas carries more water. In the

some animals with AAs that have severe pneumonia
might benefit from continuous nebulization. Potential

Systemic overhydration may develop as a result of
continuous direct nebulization or nebulizing large
volumes of a highly saturated mist. The body can absorb
the water, causing an inadvertent water imbalance. Per-
forming brief but frequent nebulization sessions (15
minutes every 4-6 hours) is usually sufficient to keep the
airway moist without causing fluid overload. Patients
requiring continuous nebulization should be monitored
for hyponatremia or hypervolemia. Nebulization of
saline rather than sterile water minimizes the risk of
electrolyte imbalance as a result of absorption from the

Polyvinylchloride tracheostomy tubes
PVC tubes are single use and disposable, and they are
the most frequently used in short-term veterinary ICU
practice. The material is porous and more likely to
accrue bacteria and mucosal debris, making it difficult
to clean. Disinfectants are ill advised because they can
absorb into the plastic and degrade the integrity of the
tube. Larger tubes have a separate inner cannula, and
separate disposable inner cannulas can be purchased to
 prolong the life of the outer cannula. Smaller sized tubes
are not equipped with a removable inner cannula

Procedure
1.
 Gather supplies
2.
 Perform hand hygiene and don clean examination gloves
3.
 Position patient, preferably in sternal recumbency or standing. Lateral recumbency is also acceptable for pneumothorax. The 
patient's comfort should help determine which position is used.
4.
Have assistant available to restrain patient or give sedation as needed. In many cats, a minimal restraint technique is
preferred and generally better tolerated.
5.
Clip and aseptically prepare the appropriate rib space:
a.
 If expecting fluid, the seventh or eighth intercostal space, at approximately the level of the costochondral junction.
b.
If expecting air, the eighth or ninth intercostal space approximately a third of the way down the chest (about halfway
between the spine and costochondral junction).
 Perform hand hygiene and don sterile gloves.
7.
Insert the appropriate size needle or butterfly catheter slowly perpendicular to the dhest wall, just canial to the rib to avoid
intercostal blood vessels.
Once through the chest wall, the needle can be directed either dorsally (if air is expected) or ventrally (if fluid is expected) so
that the needle is almost parallel to the chest wall.
 Observe hub of needle for any signs of fluid.
a.
If small amount of frank blood is aspirated suddenly or unexpectedly or if lungs can be felt rubbing against needle, it
should be removed and replaced at a slightly different location.
b.
If large amount of blood is obtained, place 1-2 mL in a blood collection tube that does not contain anticoagulant, to
evaluate for clotting.
C、
 Blood from hemothorax should not clot; blood from the heart or a blood vessel should clot normally, if patient does not
have a significant coagulopathy.
 For any other fluid, aspiration should continue until no more can be removed.
1Q.

Thoracostomy tube
Indications
Indications for a thoracostomy tube (chest tube) include
recurrent pneumothorax requiring repeated thoraco-
centesis, tension pneumothorax, pyothorax, rapidly
forming pleural effusion, and postoperative manage-
ment of thoracotomy patients. A tension pneumothorax
 occurs as air progressively accumulates in the pleural
space through a one-way valve leak of the lungs or
airways. This leads to pressure atelectasis of the lungs

Procedure
1.
Gather supplies
2.
Provide sedation or anesthesia if possible.
3.
Initial preparation as previously described (Protocol 30.2).
4.
Incise just the skin, tunnel the tube subcutaneously two to three rib spaces, and then position it perpendicular to the chest
wall and grasp in a tight fist to only allow 1-2 inches of the tube to penetrate the chest (to prevent iatrogenic trauma from
the tube penetrating too deeply).
Bluntly strike the top of the tube with the palm of other hand, popping the tube through into pleural space.
Lower the tube, decreasing the angle of insertion as the tube is advanced slightly. Once an additional 1-2 inches of the tube
and stylet are in the chest, the tube is slid off the stylet, directing it cranially and ventrally.
7.
Assess placement of the tube by using the stylet to measure the distance the tube has been advanced within the thorax.

Pain management
Indwelling chest tubes can be very painful; therefore, it
is important to provide analgesia to these patients. Bupi-
vacaine 0.5% (Hospira Inc., Lake Forest, IL) can provide
 local analgesia when administered via the thoracostomy
tube at a total dose of 1.5 mg/kg every 6-8 hours for
dogs.8* A lower dose of 1 mg/kg every 6-8 hours is rec-
ommended for cats.10.11 Cats are more sensitive to local
anesthetics than dogs and should be carefully monitored
if they are used. After injecting into the chest tubes,

The penis is directed caudo-ventrally and covered by

 the urethra has a marked sigmoid flexure near the penis.
To pass a catheter up the urethra, the penis must be

Sedation is usually required. Position the patient in lateral

Retropulsion for urethral obstruction
Retropulsion is the process of expanding the urethra
with fluid to flush an obstructing substance retrograde
and deposit it back into the bladder. It is not desirable
to use a catheter to force an obstructing substance ret-
rograde because this may damage or even rupture the
urethra. Retropulsion is most commonly needed in
males and required uncommonly in females because
       n  
of retropulsion is to expand the diameter of the urethra
with fluid to suspend the obstructing substance in a
fluid column that will carry it back into the bladder. Be
 aware that the urethra can be ruptured by overly aggres-
sive flushing technique or by overly aggressive attempts
 to advance the catheter against an obstruction.

Catheter types
There are many different types/brands of peritoneal
dialysis catheters. Most are variations of a fenestrated
silicone tube, with or without Dacron cuffs (Invista,
Wichita, KS) to promote fibrous attachments at the peri-
toneal and cutaneous exit sites. For acute short-term PD,
a percutaneous prepubic cystotomy tube catheter can be
used (see Fig. 33.1). These are generally only functional
for 12-36 hours, depending on how long it takes for
them to become occluded with omentum that will
restrict flow of dialysate out of the body. Due to the high
incidence of omentum occluding the catheter, it is highly
recommended to perform a surgical omentectomy when
placing the long-term peritoneal dialysis catheter.
There are a variety of straight and curled catheters

dialysate solution can be made by adding dextrose to
lactated Ringer solution. Osmolality should closely
approximate that of the patient and the dextrose con-

when medical management fails to control uremic
symptoms, which include vomiting, nausea, anorexia,

 It is not uncommon for patients with end-stage
chronic kidney disease to present in an acute uremic
crisis. In this setting treatment progresses similarly to
treatment for acute renal injury until the crisis is stabi-
lized. The difference is that the owner and the medical
staff know the patient will always be dialysis dependent,
so they can make decisions accordingly. It would not be
prudent to treat a chronic kidney failure patient in the
 long term with CRRT because an intermittent therapy

Procedure
1.
 Gather materials.
Perform hand hygiene.
3.
Unwrap catheter bandage by cutting bandage on opposite side of neck from where catheter is (Fig. 34.6A)
4.
Clean area around catheter exit site.
5.
 Assess catheter exit site for redness, swelling, odor, or discharge, and assess subcutaneous tunnel for signs of infection or
excess bruising.
6.
Remove cohesive bandage and the tape that is on the clamps.
7.
 Place a sterile barrier around catheter to prevent ports from touching fur or skin (Fig. 34.6B).
8.
 Don a surgical mask and exam gloves (mask and gloves should be wom from here until you begin wrapping the catheter
again).
9.
Perform a surgical-type scrub on both ports, extending from the clamps to the tops of the injection ports (Fig. 34.6C).
10.
Spray ports with dilute Nolvasan (Pfizer Animal Health, NY) or Betadine.
11.
 Place another sterile barrier around catheter.
12.
Have two squares of sterilegauze within reach, as well as all syringes that are needed
13.
 Open arterial/proximal port by removing injection cap.
14.
Wipe port opening with sterile gauze.
15.
Withdraw the exact volume (the exact volume for each side is printed on the catheter) of the lumen and discard. This is the
locking solution, so you must neverflush the catheter first (Fig. 34.6D).
16.
Flush lumen with 6 cc fresh (prepared within 24 hours) heparinized saline or normal saline.
17.
Repeat steps 13-16 on the venous/distal side.
18.
Replace the locking solution by injecting the exact volume of each lumen (Fig. 34.6E).
19.
 Place a new injection cap on each lumen (Fig. 34.6F).
20.
 At this point, you can remove your gloves and mask.
21.
Tape both clamps shut.
22.
 Place a piece of cohesive bandage around both ports

 Place a gauze square with an antiseptic cream over the catheter exit site (Fig. 34.6G).
24.
Wrap catheter with cast padding. conforming bandage, and then a flexible cohesive bandage. Wrap tightly enough that the
bandage stays in place but not too tightly (Fig. 34.6H).
25.
Place a strip of porous white tape around both ends of bandage to anchor it to skin and prevent slipping. This is especially
important for active animals.

● Blood tube with no additive (red-top tube)
● Needles: 20 or 22 gauge, 1.5-2 inches long. Needle size should be based on the patient's size and body wall thickness.
Alternately, an over-the-needle catheter of similar size may be used.
Several ≥3 cc syringes for aspiration of sample
● Ultrasound for guidance: optional
Procedure
1.
Gather supplies.
2.
 Place patient in left lateral recumbency or in a standing position. Positioning in left lateral recumbency may be most effective
to avoid inad vertent puncture of the spleen
3.
Clip and scrub the ventral abdomen.
4.
 Perform hand hygiene and done sterile gloves.
5.
Insert the needle or catheter just cranial or caudal to the umbilicus 1-2 cm to the right of midline.
 Closed technique: The needle or catheter is attached to a syringe before penetration into the abdominal cavity
b. 
 Open technique: An unattached needle or catheter is inserted into the abdominal cavity
6.
Once the bevel of the needle has been advanced through the skin and body wall (depth of needle insertion is relative
to patient size), pullback on the plunger of the syringe to apply suction if using the closed technique. If using the open 
technique, observe for a flash of fluid in the hub of the needle.
If using an overthe-needle catheter, after the catheter is inserted into the abdominal cavity, remove the stylet and collect
the sample
 If blood is aspirated, the needle should be removed from the abdomen and the sample placed in a red-top tube and observed 
for clot formation.
a.
 Blood from inadvertent laceration of a vessel or organ will clot.
b. 
 Hemorrhagic free abdominal fluid will not clot.
8.
 Allow fluid to drip into sterile collection tubes or apply gentle suction with a syringe to collect sample. The fluid should be
collected into sterile tubes for further analysis.
9.
If no fluid is retrieved:
a.
 Gently twist the needle within the abdomen and if needed advance the needle.
b. Consider four quadrant centesis, ultrasound guidance, or diagnostic peritoneal lavage.
Four Quadrant Centesis Technique:
1.
Place patient in left lateral recumbency.
2.
Clip and scrub the ventral abdomen 4 inches cranially and caudally from the umbilicus and laterally to the mammary chain on
either side. Perform hand hygiene and don sterile gloves
3.
 Using the umbilicus as a center point, divide the abdomen into four quadrants and sample the right cranial, left cranial, right
caudal, and left caudal quadrants as directed in the abdominocentesis protocol.

Procedure
1.
 Gather supplies.
2.
 Ensure that the urinary bladder is empty (manual expression or catheterization).
3.
Place patient in left lateral recumbency.
4.
 Clip and surgically prepare a wide area around the umbilicus.
5
 Place drape fenestration centered at the umbilicus.
6
 Instill local anesthetic in the skin and down to the peritoneum.
 Catheter placement will vary depending on the type of drainage catheter used.

and 1-2 cm lateral to midline.
1i.
Introduce the trochar and catheter through the body wall at a 45° angle directed caudal dorsally (toward the
coxofemoral joint).
m.
 Ad vance the catheter off the trochar ensuring that all of the fenestrations are within the peritoneal cavity.
b.
Catheters may also be introduced by the Seldinger and peel-away methods (See Chapter 4, Catheterization of the Venous
Compartment, for more information).
8.
 If no fluid is obtained when the catheter is placed, the abdomen is lavaged by instillation of 20 ml/kg of warm 0.9% sodium
chloride through the catheter and into the peritoneal cavity.
 While the fluid is being infused, the patient should be monitored carefully for signs of respiratory distress and/or
discomfort.
9.
 Clamp the infusion set.
10.
The patient's abdomen should be gently agitated to assure movement of the saline within the cavity
11.
After several minutes, open the infusion set and allow the fluid to drain through the catheter by gravity into a sterile
collection bag. Collect samples in sterile empty and EDTA-containing tubes for evaluation.
12.
If the catheter is being used for continuous abdominal drainage (such as may be the case for a uroabdomen), the catheter
should be sutured in place and covered with a sterile dressing. See Chapter 55, Care of Indwelling Device Insertion Sites, for
more information.

onto the very edge of the tube. Roll the tube a third turn, and make another fenestration at least 3/4 inches above the last fenestration.
(C) The DPL catheter following the addition of the fenestrations.
In the authors' experience, tube integrity becomes compromised (kinking. breaking) when fenestrations are larger than a third of
the circumference of the tube or if the fenestrations are made too close together. Personnel should practice this technique prior to the
procedure or have an additional tube available in the event a mistake is made.

Retention enema
 Retention enemas use substances such as lactulose that
are not absorbed by the colon. Hence they are retained
in the colon and may encourage water movement into
the colon by osmosis. This method is most commonly
used for treatment of hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose
reduces absorption of ammonia from the colon by low-
ering colonic pH and by osmotic catharsis.30
The most common technique is to instill 5-10 mL/kg
of a 30% lactulose solution into the colon, leave for
20-30 minutes, and then flush out using warm water.
A routine enema (such as that described for consti-
pation) may also suffice for treatment of hepatic
encephalopathy.

Box 38.1 Nutritional assessment
· Does the patient show clinical signs consistent with overt malnutrition?
Evidence such as >10% loss in body weight in past month, loss of lean body mass, poor hair coat quality, and nonhealing 
wounds are consistent but not specific to malnutrition. It is also important to note current body weight and perform
assessment of body condition.
· Does the patient have risk factors for development of malnutrition?
Anorexia >3 days, presence of serious inflammatory condition (e.g., sepsis, pancreatitis), structural impediments for

paresis, ileus, diarrhea), presence of condition known to increase metabolic rate (e.g., burns).
·Is the patient cardiovascularly stable, properly hydrated, and with acid-base and electrolyte disturbances addressed?
Feeding patients before addressing these disturbances puts them an increased risk for complications.
●Which route of nutrition is the most appropriate?
Patients should be carefully evaluated for the ability to tolerate enteral nutrition. This involves considering the oral,
esophageal, gastric, and enteric feeding depending where abnormalities are noted. Only when it is not feasible to feed via
 some segment of the gastrointestinal tract should parenteral nutrition be considered. For patients being considered for
parenteral nutrition, feasibility for placing central venous catheters safely and making note of obvious contraindications for
feeding parenterally (e.g., providing high dextrose to patient with uncontrolled diabetes, high lipid concentration to patients
with severe hypertriglyceridemia, high protein infusion to encephalopathic patients).
· How can nutritional support be safely initiated?
After devising a plan to meet the patient's nutritional needs, provision of nutrition should have the initial target of meeting
100% of the patient's calculated resting energy requirement (RER) within 48-72 hours. During first day of nutritional support,
aim to start with 30%-50% RER and increase by 10%-20% in each subsequent day as long as the patient shows no
 complication related to feeding.
· How patients with nutritional support be monitored?
Basic monitoring indludes daily checks in body weight, vital signs, the appearance of all sites relating to catheters and
feeding tubes, bandaging of catheters and tubes. In patients with previous metabolic disturbances, daily checks of
electrolytes and biochemical profiles may be indicated. Body condition should be checked weekly, and patients with

Patients that do not tolerate increases in feeding should be evaluated for other interventions (e.g., use of prokinetics).
Patients with metabolic abnormalities such as hyperglycemia or hyperlipidemia following initiation of nutritional support 
should be evaluated for either reformulation in composition of diet provided or treated with insulin or heparin, respectively.
·What should be looked for when reassessing patients?
Basic considerations include whether patient continues to require nutritional support or if the animal can consume
approximately 70% of RER voluntarily. Animals eating voluntarily can be transitioned from assisted feeding to voluntarily oral
feeding.
Other considerations involve how much to feed: Patients with continuing signs of lean body mass loses should be fed

With the animal's head held in a normal static position, insert the tube in a caudoventral medial direction into the ventromedial
aspect of the nasal cavity (see Fig. 40.2f).
 o In dogs the external nares are pushed dorsally after the tube has been introduced into the nose (approximately 2.0-3.0 cm) to
open the ventral meatus and aid the tube's passage into the oropharynx (see Fig. 40.2g).
· Brace the introducing hand against the animal and introduce the tube in short, well-controlled insertions up to the premeasured 
mark (see arrow in Fig. 40.2h).
Secure the tube lateral to the eye or medial to the eye and to the top of the head using superglue or sutures (see Fig. 40.2i)
 Place an Elizabethan collar to prevent removal of the tube by the animal (see Fig. 40.2j).

Items Required
● 8-14F tube in cats and small dogs
● 14-20F tube in medium to large dogs
Right-angled/ curved forceps (Carmalt, Mixter, Schnidt, or Kantrowitz)
· #10 or 11 scalpel blade
● Nylon/polypropylene suture material
●Marker
·Luer slip catheter plug
● Conforming bandage/light bandage material
Procedure
●Anesthetize, endotracheally intubate, and position the animal in right lateral recumbency. Measure the tube from the center of 
the neck to the eighth to ninth intercostal space and mark with a permanent marker. Clip the left side of the neck and aseptically

subcutaneous connective tissues and wall of the esophagus. The incision should only be large enough to allow the tips of the
forceps to be pushed through (see Fig. 40.3c).
Grasp the distal end of the tube in the forceps, taking care not to catch the tissues in the mouth in the hinge of the forceps (see
Fig. 40.3d).
 Pull the distal end of the tube grasped in the forceps rostrally out through the mouth (see Fig. 40.3e).
● Unclamp the dlistal end of the tube and gently push the distal end caudally. The forceps can be used to direct the tube into the
esophagus. The proximal end of the tube can be manipulated to facilitate the progression of the distal end of the tube into the 
esophagus to prevent the tube from forming hard kinks that could remain during tube advancement (see Fig. 40.3f).
● Once the tube is in place, the proximal end will flip from caudal to cranial. Check that enough of the tube has been inserted to 
reach the eighth to ninth intercostal space or to the premeasured mark (see Fig. 40.3g).
Confirm correct tube placement by radiographs. The outline of the tube should be visible and show the tube ending in the distal
third of the esophagus (see Fig. 40.3h).
 Place a loose purse-string suture around the tube entrance site (see Fig. 40.3i).

Allodynia
Pain caused by a stimulus that does not normally result in pain.
Analgesia
Absence of pain in response to stimulation that would normally be painful.
Anesthesia
Medically induced insensitivity to pain. The procedure may render the patient unconscious
(general anesthesia) or merely numb a body part (local anesthesia).
Causalgia
A syndrome of sustained buming pain, allodynia, and hyperpathia after a traumatic nerve
lesion, often combined with vasomotor and sudomotor dysfunction and later trophic
dhanges.
Distress
Acute anxiety or pain.
Dysphoria
A state of anxiety or restlessness, often accompanied by vocalization.
Hyperalgesia
An increased response to a stimulus that is normally painful.
Hypoalgesia
Diminished pain in response to a normally painful stimulus.
 Hyperesthesia 
Increased sensitivity to stimulation, excluding the special senses.
 Hyperpathia
 Painful syndrome characterized by an abnormally painful reaction to a stimulus and an
increased threshold.
Maladaptive pain (functional)
Hypersensitivity to pain resulting from abnormal processing of normal input.
Maladaptive pain (central)
 Pain initiated or caused by a primary lesion or dysfunction in the CNs. Often called “central
pain."

 Neurogenic pain
Pain initiated or caused by a primary lesion, dysfunction, or transitory perturbation in the 
peripheral or central nervous system.
Neuropathic pain
Pain initiated or caused by a primary lesion or dysfunction in the peripheral or central
nervous system.
Nociceptor
A receptor preferentially sensitive to a noxious stimulus or to a stimulus that would become
 noxious if prolonged.
Nociception
 Physiologic component of pain consisting of the processes of transduction, transmission,
and modulation of neural signals generated in response to an external noxious
stimulus.
Noxious stimulus
A noxious stimulus is one that is damaging to normal tissues

Temperament
A change in temperament becoming aggressive or withdrawn. Aggression in response
 to forceful movement of painful area. Insomnia
Vocalization
Vocalization in response to palpation or movement of painful area.
 Posture, locomotion
Guarding of the painful area. Severe abdominal pain may result in hunched posture,
prayer position, falling and/or rolling. Reluctance to lie down. Trembling: increased
muscle tension
Facial expression
Dull eyes, "staring into space," drooping ears.
Grooming
Decrease of normal grooming. unkempt hair coat. Piloerection. Licking. kicking. biting,
or scratching painful area. Self-mutilation if pain is severe.
Activity level
Restlessness or overall decrease in activity level. Failure to use litter box; increased or
decreased urination.
Food and water consumption
Decreased.
Aspect of Behavior
Species Specific
Cats
Vocalization is rare. Hissing or growling when approached or handled. Tendency to hide
in endlosed space. Tendency to hide painful body parts. Decreased activity. lack of
grooming. hunched posture, dissociation from the environment and lack of interaction
with severe pain. Aggression if approached or when painful area is manipulated.

pain score (CMPs-SF) can be applied quickly and reliably in a clinical setting and has been designed as a clinical decision-making tool
that was developed for dogs in acute pain. It includes 30 descriptor options within 6 behavioral categories, indluding mobility. Within
each category, the descriptors are ranked numerically according to their associated pain severity, and the person carrying out the
assessment chooses the descriptor within each category that best fits the dog's behavior/condition. It is important to carry out the
assessment procedure as described on the questionnaire, following the protocol closely. The pain score is the sum of the rank scores.
 The maximum score for the 6 categories is 24, or 20 if mobity is impossible to assess. The total CMPS-SF score has been shown to 
be a useful indicator of analgesic requirement, and the recommended analgesic intervention level is 6/24 or 5/20.

 Protocol 43.1 Constant rate infusion recipes
 Morphine,* lidocaine, ketamine CRI for syringe pump infusion 
Procedure
1.
 Make sure each of your components is compatible with the others. Then determine your dose rate for each component
Example: Morphine 0.1 mg/kg/h, lidocaine 3 mg/kg/h, ketamine 0.6 mg/kg/h
2.
Calculate the dose per hour for each component required for your patient, based on its body weight. Then, using the
concentration of each drug, calculate the rate in milliliters per hour.
Example: MLK CRI for a dog, body weight 20kg.
Morphine 0.1 × 20 = 2 mg/h. Using morphine 10 mg/mL, rate is 0.2 mL/h
Lidocaine 3 × 20 = 60 mg/h. Using lidocaine 20 mg/mL, rate is 3 mL/h
Ketamine 0.6 × 20 = 12 mg/h. Using ketamine 100 mg/ml, rate is 0.12 mL/h.
3.
 Determine the volume of each component required.
A 12-hour infusion of this mixture would require:
2.4mL morphine (0.2 mL/h × 12 h)
36 mL lidocaine (3 mL/h × 12 h) 
1.5 mL ketamine (0.12 mL/h × 12 h)
 Mix components and determine the rate at which the mixture will be infused
The morphine, lidocaine, and ketamine can be mixed together in a syringe and the rate calculated as the sum of the rates for
each of the three components.
In this case, the MLK mixture would be administered at 3.3 mL/h
Morphine,* lidocaine, ketamine CRl for fluid pump infusion
1.
Make sure each of your components is compatible with the others and with the crystalloid fluid you are using for the CRl. In
most cases, 5% dextrose is the fluid of choice for drug infusions.
2.
Determine the dose of each component
Morphine 0.1 mg/kg/h, lidocaine 2.4 mg/kg/h, ketamine 0.6 mg/kg/h
3.
Draw 65 ml of fluid out of a 500-ml bag of 5% dextrose and discard
4.
Add 1200 mg (60ml of 20 mg/mL) lidocaine to the bag.
5.
Add 50mg of morphine to the bag.
6.
Ad 300mg of ketamine to the bag.
The resulting mixture contains 0.1 mg/ml of morphine, 2.4 mg/ml of lidocaine, and 0.6 mg/mL of ketamine.
7.
The rate of administration (in milliters per hour) of the mixture is equal to the body weight of the patient in kilograms.
Example: For a 20-kg patient, run this mixture at 20 ml/h
*Other opioids (usually μ agonist drugs) can be used in place of morphine in these recipes. The appropriate CRI doses for each

Protocol 44.14 Epidural
Procedure
1. The patient should be placed in either sternal or lateral recumbency depending on the operator's preference. Some people 
extend the pelvic limbs cranially to possibly increase the size of the epidural space; this is a personal preference.
2.
Clip an area at the lumbosacral junction (see Figs. 44.7A and B). Sterile technique is very important in this procedure, so clip
an adequate area that allows aseptic technique.
3.
Aseptically prepare the skin.
4.
After washing hands and while donning sterile gloves, palpate the wings of the ilium with your thumb and middle finger.
Using the index finger, palpate the spinous process of the seventh lumbar vertebra.
5.
Slide the index finger caudally down the spinous process until the lumbosacral space is palpable. A slight divot can usually be
 palpated here between L7 and S1.

 of needle placement on a dog skeleton: dorsal view. (d) Location of needle placement on a dog skeleton: lateral view.
6.
Keeping the index finger in place (to maintain positioning), insert a 20- or 22-gauge, 1.5- to 3.0-inch spinal needle (length
and size of needle depend on patient size) perpendicular to the skin, ensuring the needle is precisely on midline in 360°.
7.
 Continue to advance the spinal needle slowly, adjusting the needle angle as needed either cranially or caudally, to ensure 
proper placement in the epidural space (see Figs. 44.7C and 44.7D).
8.
 The epidural space sits just ventral to the ligamentum flavum. As the needle is advanced through the ligamentum flavum,
usually a "pop" can be felt, although this is not a completely reliable indicator.
9.
 To ensure correct epidural placement of the needle's tip, remove the stylet, and using a glass syringe, which provides little
to no resistance, inject a small amount of air (0.25-1.0ml depending on patient size). While injecting air there should be no
resistance and no back pressure on the plunger of the syringe. If resistance or back pressure on the plunger is appreciated,
you are most likely not in the epidural space. Repeat the preceding steps to obtain proper placement.
10.
 Another method of verifying correct needle placement is by using the "hanging drop" technique. This technique is best 
performed with the patient in stemal recumbency. Once the needle is placed in the skin, remove the stylet and fill the hub
of the needle with saline or local anesthetic. Once you are in the epidural space, the fluid in your needle will drop into the 
epidural space. This technique is not 1o0% accurate because tissue plugs can obstruct the needle.
(Continued)
570 Advanced Monitoring and Procedures for Small Animal Emergency and Critical Care
Once correct needle placement is verified, examine the needle for blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CsF). If none is observed,
 gently aspirate the needle to reconfirm absence of blood and CSF.
12.
Slowly inject the opioid of choice (refer to Table 44.1). It should inject freely with no resistance, similar to an IV injection.
Ifresistance is experienced, you are most likely not in the epidural space and you willneed to repeat the preceding process.
Follow the opioid with bupivacaine 7.5%, 0.1-0.4 mg/kg: this too should inject with no resistance. If resistance is noted, you 
are most likely not in the epidural space and will need to repeat the process.
Once you have administered the drugs, remove needle, and place the patient with affected side down, allowing the drugs to
disperse to the desired location.33
Protocol 44.15 Epidural catheter placement
Procedure
1.
 Epidural catheter kits are available with most if not all the 
components needed for the placement of the epidural catheter
(see Fig. 44.8).
2.
 The procedure is fairly similar to that of an epidural, but in
place of a regular spinal needle, a Tuohy needle is used
The curved tip of the needle allows the catheter to be passed
 in the appropriate direction (cranially) after 
needle insertion.
3.
 Follow the procedure for performing an epidural injection.
However, replace the regular spinal needle with a Tuohy spinal
needle.
4.
 Once in the epidural space, remove the stylet and pass the
epidural catheter through the Tuohy needle
5.
The tip of the epidural catheter should be placed in dlose

proximity to the painful area. Therefore, premeasuring the 
kit.
catheter prior to placement is important.
6.
Remove the Tuohy needle while leaving the catheter in place.
1.
Although not an absolute guarantee of correct placement, a radiograph can be performed to verify placement of the epidural
catheter. Intended catheter placement is not always achieved because of coiling of the catheter and lateral deviation. The
presence of an epicdural catheter decreases the likelihood of failure, but it does not guarantee 100% success. If proper
 placement was not obtained, repeat steps 1-5.
8.
It is important to keep the insertion port of the catheter clean and sterile at all times. The insertion site should be covered with
a sterile bandage, and aseptic technique should be used when delivering drugs through the insertion port. Reapplication of a
sterile bandage should be applied whenever administration of drugs is performed. The insertion site should be inspected daily
for inflammation and infection.
 Protocol 44.16 Continuous epidural drug infusion?
Procedure
1.
Dilute preservative-free morphine to 0.5 mg/ml with 0.9% saline.
2.
Mix 1 ml of 0.75% bupivicaine with 5 mL of 0.5 mg/ml dilute morphine.
3.
Deliver solution at 0.03-0.05 mL/kg/hr.
A.
If rear limb paralysis occurs, change concentration of solution to 1 mL of 0.75% bupivicaine in 11 mL of 0.5 mg/ml dilute
morphine and deliver at above rate.

In some cases of cardiac arrhythmias (e.g-, ventricular
premature contractions [VPC], the palpated pulse rate
will differ from the actual heart rate seen on the electro-
cardiogram (ECG). Arrhythmias will be palpated as
weak or irregular pulses and should be verified with
other monitoring equipment.
The pulse rate is calculated by counting the pulse over
 a set number of seconds and multiplying this time by a
value to equal 60 seconds. The resulting value is the
 heart rate in beats per minute (bpm) (see the following
equations):

can be directly measured. An advantage of using the
esophageal stethoscope is that the heart and lungs may
 be auscultated constantly and directly. Changes in rate,
or in the quality of a heart murmur or lung sounds, may
be detected as they happen. Some esophageal stetho-
 scopes are combined with temperature probes and ECG
electrodes.
The ECG is used to monitor both the heart rate and
rhythm. ECG interpretation is addressed in Chapter 7.

Recumbent patient care
The long-term anesthetized patient requires recumbent
patient care (Protocol 46.1). Three components contrib-
ute to recumbent patient care: proper patient position-
ing, decubital ulcer prevention and management, and
early mobility.
Patient positioning
 Patients undergoing long-term anesthesia should be
provided with clean, dry, and very well-padded
bedding.3 All eliminations have to be cleaned immedi-
ately to maintain the skin dry at all times; use of absor-
bent pads may assist with nursing care. Any bony
protuberances should be carefully padded.1* The extrem-

suring exact urinary output is important.
 Two methods of urinary bladder catheterization are
intermittent and indwelling catheter insertion. Decision
on which method to used depends on the needs of each
individual patient. Urinary tract infection (UTl) is a risk
factor for urinary bladder catheterization regardless of
the method. Duration of catheterization has been shown
to be a more important factor for development of a UTI
than the method of catheterization.?2 A Cochrane review
reported that the incidence of bacteriuria is higher in
the indwelling catheter patient population compared
with intermitently catheterized patients; however, some
patients with bacteriuria were suspected to have bacte-
rial colonization rather than a symptomatic UT1.33

Protocol 48.1 Blood smear preparation
Items Required
●Nitrile or latex gloves
Grease-free microscope slide
·Pencil
● Blood sample anticoagulated with EDTA
● Capillary tube
"Spreader": either the frosted edge of a second microscope slide or a slide coverslip
100% methyl alcohol (for delayed evaluation)
●Microscope with oil immersion lens

Important notes
 The following protocol has been written for a right-handed technician. For left-handed technicians, all reference to "right" and 
"left" in the protocol should be reversed.
Nitrile or latex gloves should be worn throughout the entire procedure. Any biologic material from the patient, including blood.

avoided. It is always advisable to make at least two smears from each blood sample in case the result obtained from one is not
 satisfactory. There will be one blood smear per microscope slide.
Procedure
1.
 Gather supplies
2.
 Label the underside or frosted edge of a grease-free microscope slide with a pencil to identify the slide. Labeling the wrong
side or area of the microscope slide will result in the removal of the label during staining.
3.
 Place the microscope slide against a white background on the laboratory bench.
 Draw a small sample of fresh blood or well-mixed EDTA blood into a capillary tube and place a small drop of blood on the
right end of the slide about 1 cm from the edge. If the EDTA anticoagulated blood sample has been previously refrigerated,
allow time for the sample to warm to room temperature and mix the sample thoroughly by inverting or rolling the collection
tube before initiating the blood smear.
5.
 Create a "spreader" either by using a microscope coverslip or a second microscope slide. If the latter is performed, ensure
that the edge of the spreader is smooth and does not have any chips or fractures that may cause irregular accumulations of
blood along the edge of the spreader. The edge of the spreader should be narrower than the full width of the blood smear
slide. This will prevent the spreader from pushing cells to the edge of the blood smear slide.

downward.
7.
 Place the spreaderin contact with the slide parallelto the short edge of the slide and a litte to the left of the drop of blood.
The angle of contact between the spreader and the slide is important and should be 20-30° to vertical. A more obtuse angle
will cause a thicker smear, whereas a more acute angle will cause a thinner smear
8.
 Pull the spreader to the right until it encounters the droplet of blood and allow the blood to run along the edge of the
spreader.
9.
After the blood has run the length of the spreader's edge, drag the spreader toward the opposite (left-hand) end of the
slide with a steady uninterrupted motion. The blood along the spreader's edge willbe drawn behind the spreader, creating
a blood smear along the slide. The action of dragging rather than pushing the spreader in creating the smear is extremely
important. Never place the spreader behind (to the right side of) the droplet of blood with the intent of pushingthe blood
across the slide because this will cause damage to the blood cells.

The ideal smear should cover about three-fourths of the length of the slide. It should be thick at one end and taper to a thin
feathered edge at the other. The aim is to create a region on the slide where the cells are spaced far enough apart to be
counted and differentiated.

 Allow the smear to air dry in a horizontal position. Do not apply heat because it may distort the blood cells. Dried blood
smears are fragile, so always handle with care.

If blood smear staining and evaluation wil be delayed, fix the slide by submerging it in 100% methyl alcohol for 1 minute.
This will enable a delay of staining for up to 3 days

will diffuse across the membrane until they are in equal concentration on either side of the membrane. Permeable solutes are thus
considered inefective osmoles because their presence on one side of the membrane (or the other) does not cause water to move
across the membrane; the solutes move instead.
The bottom figure demonstrates that when more solutes exist on one side of a semipermeable membrane and the membrane is
not permeable to those solutes, water will move across the membrane until the solutes are in equal concentration; this movement is
caused by osmotic pressure. When the impermeable solutes that generate the osmotic pressure are colloid partidles, then the pressure
generated is called coffoid osmotic pressure.

which moves in and out of the cell as a result of osmolar gradients established between the intracellular and interstitial fluid compart-
ments. The concentration gradient of solutes on either side of a membrane dictates how water will move by osmosis across the cell

the cell membrane by active membrane pumps and restricted channels.
The capillary membrane is permeable to water and small solutes, and it is relatively impermeable to blood cells and large
molecules such as proteins. The most abundant small solutes in the extracellular fluid are sodium, glucose, chloride, bicarbonate, and
urea, which are equally distributed across the vascular membrane. Plasma water is the vehicle transporting oxygen and solutes to the

5.
Aspirate or decant the supematant saline from the red blood cells.
6.
Repeat steps 3-5 two additional times.
7.
 After the last wash, decant the supernatant and centrifuge the red cells for 15 additional seconds to prepare a packed cell

Incubation and Centrifugation
1.
 Shake each tube gently to mix the contents within.
2.
Cover each tube or the entire group with plastic or Parafilm to prevent condensation from entering any of the tubes.
Incubate all tubes at 37° C for 15 minutes.
4.
Centrifuge (1000 x g or 3400 rpm) the tubes for 15 seconds.
5.
Read each tube and grade according to the chart below. Reactions should be read in a well-lit area, preferably with a white
background to maximize visualization. A 3 × 5 magnification lens can be used, if needed.
Grading
1.
Remove one tube from the centrifuge at a time, taking care not to dislodge the red cell button.
2.
Note the color of the supermatant. Free hemoglobin (red-tinged supernatant) greater than the amount in the original blood 
sample denotes hemolysis. Hemolysis is considered a posifive reaction.

Tube/test
Result
Interpretation
Recipient Autocontrol
 Positive
Patient has formed autoantibodies against self RBCs; these autoantibodies
 may also cause hemagglutination of donor RBCs in vitro and/or in vivo.
 Recommend finding a compatible donor or the "least incompatible" donor
(hemagglutination in major is less than in autocontrol).
 Recipient Autocontrol
Negative
No detectable autoantibodies.
Major (Recipient)
Positive
Recipient of intended whole blood or pRBCs has alloantibodies against an 
antigen(s) on the donor RBC surface.
Do not use this donor's red blood cells.
Major (Recipient)
Negative
Recipient of intended whole blood or pRBCs is compatible with donor RBCs.
Minor (Recipient)
 Positive
Donor has alloantibodies against patient RBCs.
●  Donor screening should exclude donors who have previously received 
blood products so to decrease the risk of alloantibody production
● This could reflect an AB blood type incompatibility in a cat if not properly
blood typed prior to crossmatch testing.
· In cats, the presence of non-AB blood type allantibodies may result in a
positive minor cossmatch.
Minor (Recipient)
Negative
Donor plasma does not contain detectable alloantibodies to recipient RBCs
Rouleaux
Present
Hemagglutination that disperses following saline replacement suggests an
increase in plasma proteins is causing red blood cells to loosely aggregate.
This is not thought to be of clinical relevance in transfusion of red blood cells.

sion. This is also true in cats for the most part, but a
non-AB blood group alloantibody is a possibility in cats
that have never been transfused. In addition to under-
standing the terminology of crossmatch tests, two of the
biggest challenges are preparing an appropriate RBC
suspension and grading of the reactions. Protocol

describe the appropriate color similar to the appearance
 of red Kool-Aid (Fig. 53.3). For reaction grading gentle
resuspension of the red cell button is key with continued
observation; vigorous shaking could result in the
observer missing the reaction (i.e., a false negative). A
lack of RBC agglutinates is considered a negative or

Familiarity with both blood typing and crossmatch

b.
Provide supplemental oxygen therapy.
Establish at least one IV catheter and resuscitate from shock and persistent hypotension
2.
Emergently cool the patient if rectal temperature is >40.9°C (105°F), cooling as rapidly as possible until the body temperature
is 40.9°℃ (105°F).
a.
 Soak the patient to the skin with copious amounts of room-temperature ("tepid") water
b. 
 Administer room-temperature IV fluids at rates necessary to combat shock or persistent hypotension.
C. 
 Direct fans on the patient to facilitate surface cooling.
d.
Reduce the room temperature, if possible.
Do nof use cold IV fluids, ice-water baths, or surface cooling with ice water or ice packs.
3.
Reduce the rate of cooling once the patient's body temperature is <40.9°C (105°F) to avoid rebound hypothermia.
a.
Cease cooling with water and dry the hair/skin.
b.
Remove fans.
Return room temperature to normal.
Provide supportive warming once the patient's temperature has been reduced to 39.8°C (103°F).

Monitor blood pressures, lactate clearance, urine output, mentation, and other measures of perfusion to check for shock
hypotension. Continue IV fluid therapy as directed by the attending veterinarian.
b.
Monitor blood glucose and venous blood gas analyses every 6-12 hours. Maintain normoglycemia with supplemental
dextrose.
Monitor arterial blood gas analysis or pulse oximetry and capnography to assess oxygenation and ventilation. IV fluids
should be supplemented with dextrose as needed to maintain normoglycemia.
 Monitor for occult or active bleeding and petechiae and ecchymoses: perform coagulation tests every 6-12 hours and 
serial CBCs every 12-24 hours to screen for thrombocytopenia and coagulopathies.
e.
Monitor the ECG continuously to detect cardiac arhythmias, especially ventricular arhythmias. Provide specific anti-
arrhythmic therapy as directed for hemodynamically unstable patients.
