Preface
Our goal is to provide a practical and engaging resource for veterinary students, residents and
practitioners to develop and practice skills in interpretation of clinical chemistry data, using a
evaluation of the health of veterinary patients. Many texts dlescribe the characteristics of
individual tests, however there are few resources to assist practitioners in developing the
The examples used in this text have been drawn from actual clinical cases reviewed by the

examples in each chapter. Because the interpretation of clinical chemistry data depends heavily
on the clinical context, brief histories and physical examination findings are included along with
other clinicopathologic data such as CBC, urinalysis, cytology or fluid analysis. Some cases also
have figures that illustrate important findings on the physical examination, imaging studies, or
microscopic evaluation of patient samples that students may find particularly helpful. Keys
dliscussing the interpretation of individual analytes follow the clinical presentation. At the end of
each case, a summary is given for each patient that includes a description of follow up tests and
response to treatment.
Important diagnostic considerations that we have emphasized include the effects of age and
artifacts that might be over-interpreted as indicating disease and the impact of the statistica

For many of these cases, the diagnosis was confirmed using ancillary tests or by biopsy or
necropsy. We acknowledge that the interpretation of the data for each case in this book may be
only one of several potentially correct interpretations. Mechanisms for abnormalities are the
consensus of two board certified clinical pathologists based on the existing literature at the time
the text was written, but these may be modified as veterinary science evolves. We hope that

Unlike many other clinical pathology tests that are performed by diagnostic laboratories,
clinical chemistry profile reports do not come with interpretations from the laboratory that
generated them. The purpose of this book is to assist the veterinary student, veterinary
resident, or veterinary practitioner in developing his or her skills in laboratory data
provide a brief review of pertinent tests and a guide to their interpretation, this book is NOT
an exhaustive textbook of clinical chemistry and use of this manual requires some
background knowledge of clinical chemistry and veterinary medicine. The authors
recommend that the reader have a classical text reference to accompany this volume, and
several excellent potential resources are listed below.

an overview of the principles for the development of reference ranges and guidelines for
integrating laboratory data with other clinical information. Subsequent chapters are based
included in that section (for example, a patient with an elevated serum alkaline
phosphatase level secondary to an endocrinopathy or bone disease may be presented in
the liver enzyme chapter).
Each chapter contains multiple cases from a variety of species that are designated Level 1,
Level 2, or Level 3 based on the level of difficulty of the interpretation. It is recommended 
that the reader begin with introductory Level 1 cases and work forward. Although each case
can stand on its own and the reader is not obligated to work consecutive cases, the order
was carefully chosen to emphasize differentiating diseases with potentially similar laboratory
provided for each case, along with radiographs if available. Each case contains an
interpretation section where all abnormalities are reviewed, and a subsequent section where
all abnormalities are integrated into the clinical picture for final diagnosis and recommen-
dations for further testing. When known, the clinical outcome of the case is provided since all
of the cases presented here are real, live patients. This book is designed to provide the
reader with an ENJOYABLE and PRACTICAL resource for improving skills in clinical chemistry
interpretation.
The diagnostic plans and treatment information described for these cases are
informational/historical only and should not be considered recommendations for any of
the described conditions.

Developing a Plan for Interpretation
Indications for the Clinical Chemistry Profile
The clinical chemistry profile is an integral component of the minimum database for most
patients. Blood may be drawn for performing a clinical chemistry profile for multiple reasons
including
1. Screening for disease in apparently healthy individuals (pre-anesthetic screens or
geriatric profiles).
2. Assessing the severity of disease: the magnitude of deviation from the reference range of
an analyte may be related to the severity of organ damage or dysfunction, but this is not the
case for alltests.
3. Resolving differential diagnoses.
4. Development of prognosis.
5. Determining drug toxicities.
6. Evaluating response to therapy using serial testing.
Because all tests have false positives, false negatives, and laboratory artifacts that could
impact the results, a diagnosis or prognosis can rarely be made on the basis of any single
test result. To arrive at a correct diagnosis, all laboratory test results must be analyzed along
other diagnostic procedures.
Step 1: Is the blood work abnormal or is the patient abnormal?
There are various reasons for laboratory results to fall outside of reference ranges, and some
of these have nothing to do with the presence of disease in a patient.
pue suabean jo sad ayn uo puadap sesse Ansiauo eiuo Aueu jo shinsau aua asnag
analyzers that are used, reference intervals should be generated within each laboratory
whenever possible. The use of published reference intervals is sometimes unavoidable,
especially with uncommon species, but methodologic differences may cause normal patients
to have test results that fall outside these published values. Specific reference intervals also
need to be developed for patients of certain ages (i.e., neonatal), reproductive status (i.e.,
pregnant or lactating), or breeds. Keep in mind that human laboratories may accept
veterinary samples, but may not have species specific reference intervals.
Reference intervals are generated by measuring an analyte in the blood of a population of 
apparently healthy animals. The mean value is calculated, and the reference range is set as the
consequence of this is that approximately 5% of "normal" patients will have results that fall
outside of the reference interval (Figure 1-1). For example, the statistical probability that a
completely normal patient will have all normal results on a serum biochemical profile
containing 12 tests is only 54%!

2. Accuracy and precision in the laboratory.
Accuracy and precision are reguired to ensure that abnormal values truly reflect the status of
the patient and are not the result of poor laboratory technique. Accuracy is the agreement
between the laboratory result and its "true" value, and precision is the agreement between
replicate measurements (Figure 1-2).

population.
Diagnostic sensitivity is a measure of the frequency of a positive or abnormal test result in
the presence of disease.
Diagnostic specificity is a measure of the frequency of a negative or normal test result in the
absence of disease.
While sensitivity and specificity reflect the accuracy of a test, they are determined using
highly selected populations (all diseased for sensitivity or all free of the disease for
which is the percentage of patients with a positive test that actually have the disease.
Positive predictive value takes into account the prevalence of the disease. Be aware that tests
are often evaluated at universities or large referral centers, where the prevalence of disease
may be quite different from your clinical practice.
4. Laboratory artifacts or errors in the collection and processing of samples may cause a
normal patient to have abnormal laboratory data. It is beyond the scope ot this book to list
all possible artifacts and errors, however these should ALWAYS be considered when the
laboratory data seems incongruous with the clinical presentation of the patient. Hemolysis,

of electrolytes or enzymes out of cells and into serum may also be a problem. Collection of
samples soon after eating can result in lipemia or elevation of serum glucose, cholesterol,
and triglycerides. Certain types of medications may have physiological effects that result in
laboratory abnormalities, or they or their metabolites may directly interfere with assay
methodology.
 5. Normal clinical chemistry profiles do not rule out disease. In some cases, laboratory
parameters only become abnormal very late in the course of disease (i.e., they lack
sensitivity). Good examples of this are BUN and creatinine, which only become elevated
when approximately 75% of renal function is already lost. In other cases, the routine clinical
chemistry profile does not contain good tests for disease. For example, there are no tests
although hypoxia or hypoperfusion may cause secondary abnormalities that are detected by
performing a serum biochemical profile
Step 2: Group analytes into meaningful categories for
interpretation
Many clinical chemistry profiles have their individual tests already grouped in some logical
order on the report, often according to organ system. Some laboratories offer mini-profiles at
lower cost that are specific for liver or kidney disease. It is often helpful to generate your
own lists of tests to evaluate as a group when trying to rule out certain problems. For
example:

 Evaluation of laboratory data is similar to the approach to the physical examination, taking a
history, or evaluation of radiographs. It is not so important exactly what approach you utilize,
as it is to develop a consistent method with which you are comfortable. A thorough and
methodical approach will ensure that nothing is missed, and the process will become more
efficient, which is always important in busy practices.
Step 3: Integrate the clinical chemistry data in the context of
clinical information
If your patient has clinical chemistry abnormalities, but appears healthy, follow the outline in
Figure 1-3. Interpretation of some laboratory data as normal or abnormal depends on clinica
information. For example, isosthenuria in a well-hydrated patient that just consumed a large
amount of water may be normal. lsosthenuria in a dehydrated patient that is also azotemic

differential diagnoses, however some can likely be ruled out based on history and physica
examination findings, while the remainder can be prioritized as more or less likely based on
clinical information. Using the example of feline hyperglycemia, a thin cat with a history of
polyuria/polydipsia and weight loss is more likely to have diabetes mellitus than a cat with a
similar degree of hyperglycemia that was anxious during the clinic visit but has no clinical
signs or history compatible with diabetes.
Step 4: Try to explain all problems and abnormalities of
laboratory data with one primary problem.
This is a standard technique for developing diagnoses for patients. Keep in mind that

doesn't mean you can't have diarrhea."
the primary process. For example, liver enzyme elevations or urinary tract infections may be
associated with diabetes mellitus. Many diseases may result in laboratory evidence of
dehydration (increased packed cell volume, total protein, and/or albumin). Animals that have
been hit by cars may have elevations of liver enzymes because of traumatic hepatocellular
Developing a Plan for Interpretaion
Step 5: Use the clinical chemistry profile to guide the choices of
further diagnostic work up.
Achieving an accurate diagnosis for a patient almost always requires a combination of clinical
history, physical examination findings, some type of laboratory work, imaging studies, and
possibly other testing. The serum biochemical profile may show evidence of a problem, for
Based on the history and physical, the veterinarian may choose to perform imaging of the
abdomen, a parvo test, an ACTH level, or other tests to help cetermine the underlying
problem.
The sensitivity and specificity of many tests are improved by performing them on the
appropriate population of patients. For example, 95% or more of dogs with hyperadrenocor-
ticism have increased ALP. Because dexamethasone suppression and ACTH stimulation
testing can be difficult to interpret, a practitioner can maximize the performance of these
laboratory data that also suggests the likelihood of hyperadrenocorticism.
Laboratory and clinical dlata can also aid in prioritizing possible diagnostic procedures when
there are financial limitations or when some testing options are more invasive than others.
disease. As a result, if a cat is losing weight, is tachycardic, and has a palpable nodule in its
neck, it may be more appropriate to run a T4 level than to schedule a liver biopsy.

signs such as depression, weight loss, anorexia, diarrhea, and vomiting. Laboratory testing
can be performed to determine if liver disease is the cause of these clinical signs, however
interpretation of the results can be complicated because no consistent laboratory
abnormalities are found in all patients with liver disease, and extrahepatic problems can also
result in laboratory data that can be compatible with hepatobiliary disease.
The following are general tips to guide the interpretation of liver enzymes

underlying disease, resolution of the enzyme-inducing process, or scarcity of viable

considered to be diagnostically significant.
of liver disease.
9. Once extrahepatic causes for liver enzyme elevations have been ruled out clinically or by
the use of further laboratory testing, liver enzyme values can be used to categorize the
general process as:
· Hepatocellular damage (increased serum ALT, AST in small animals; increased serum SDH,
AST in large animals)
bilirubin in large animals)
· Decreased liver function (increased serum bile acids, bilirubin, ammonia or fibrin
degradation products; prolonged PT or PTT, decreased serum albumin, cholesterol, urea,
glucose)
· A combination of the above.

It should be recognized that hepatocellular damage will lead to swelling of hepatocytes and
secondary cholestasis, and that bile acids accumulating during cholestasis are toxic to
laboratory values than the secondary processes, but late in the course of the disease, it may
not be possible to determine the initiating cause. While blood tests can suggest that hepatic
disease is likely, a specific diagnosis almost always requires cytology or biopsy of liver tissue.
Guide for Evaluating the Cases in This Chapter
Review medication history, physical examination findings, and laboratory data to rule
out extrahepatic conditions listed in Table 2-1
Hint! Not all of the patients presented in this chapter have hepatobiliary disease.
Step 1
If hepatobiliary disease is the cause of laboratory abnormalities, decide which
processes are likely to be occurring in this patient: hepatocellular damage,
cholestasis, and/or decreased liver function. Additional tests of liver function may
be needed.
Step 2
When possible, determine which process is the predominant one: hepatocellular
damage, cholestasis, or decreased liver function.
Step 3
Choose appropriate additional testing as needed to determine a specific diagnosis.
Hint: Remember that the liver is integrally involved in hemostasis! Don't forget to
evaluate coagulation status prior to invasive procedures such as biopsy.

Interpretation
CBC: The mild normocytic normochromic anemia is actually within published reference
intervals for a puppy of Spunky's age. Total protein at the low end of the reference interval is
also appropriate for a young puppy and is due to low globulin levels, but under other
circumstances might suggest blood loss. This data illustrates the need to verify appropriate
reference intervals for pediatric patients. Given Spunky's history of apparently ingesting glass,
the PCV should be monitored along with careful observation for any signs of blood loss,
especially via the gastrointestinal tract.
Serum Biochemical Profile
most likely normal during this period of rapid skeletal growth. Differential diagnoses for
hyperphosphatemia with concurrent hypercalcemia in adult dogs include renal failure, vitamin
D toxicosis, and hypoadrenocorticism. Spunky's other laboratory data and his clinical history
are not supportive of any of these diagnoses.
Mildly increased ALP (1.5x): As indicated in the introduction, there are many hepatic and
extrahepatic causes of increased ALP in the dog. In young, growing dogs, mild increases in
ALP are normal and associated with bone growth. ALP allows mineral to be deposited in
bone (Kronenberg). A complete medical history should include questions about exposure to
any medications that could induce ALP.
Case Summary and Outcome
Normal findings for a young large breed dog
This combination of "abnormalities" constitutes normal physiology in this patient, who is very
unlikely to have liver disease. Spunky was discharged with no further problems.

air, landed, and initially did not move. After a few minutes, she rose and started walking, but
her front legs collapsed. At this point she lay on the grass crying. She has been treated in the
past for pyoderma, but is not currently on any medications.
On physical examination, Bandit has bruising in the left axillary region, an abrasion on the
medial aspect of the left radius and ulna, and a swelling on the thoracic wall caudal to the
point of the left elbow. She is lame and painful on her left front leg, but otherwise, appears
bright and alert. Radiographs of the chest, abdomen and left leg show only a mild

is not a factor in this case at this time. While ALT is relatively liver specific in small animal
patients, AST could be compatible with some damage to muscle tissue or other organs. If 
muscle damage is very severe, ALT may increase due to leakage from muscle as well
(Swenson). A serum CK level could be run to assess muscle damage, however, it is likely to
be elevated in this case due to the trauma. The most likely cause for the Bandit's increased
hepatocellular enzymes is trauma to the liver, though transient hypoperfusion of the liver due
to shock following the accident could also be a factor.
Urinalysis: Bandit's urinalysis shows well-concentrated alkaline urine with small numbers of
red and white blood cells. The presence of protein and heme are compatible with blood
the urogenital tract. Trace to 1+ (30 mg/dl) protein often is not significant when detected in a
concentrated urine sample. However, false positive reactions for protein may be seen on
urine dipstick results performed on alkaline urine. Carnivores generally have aciduria and
alkaline urine may indicate the presence of urease positive bacteria. Transient alkaline urine
may be observed postprandially
Dogs have a low renal threshold for conjugated bilirubin and detection of a trace to 1+
bilirubin is not unusual, especially in concentrated urine. In the dog, bilirubin can be
observed in the urine prior to any detectible rise in serum bilirubin concentrations
Case Summary and Outcome
Bandit was discharged the next morning with medication for control of pain. She had an
uneventful recovery.

the CBC appears within normal limits.
Increased ALP (2.5x): This relatively mild elevation in ALP is quite nonspecific by itself. Due
to the numerous causes for increased ALP in the dog, interpretation is heavily dependent on
clinical information. In the context of Chewie's history and physical examination findings,
increased ALP due to bone disease seems likely. While osteomyelitis is a possibility, so is
osteosarcoma. As always, the possibility of endocrine disorders and exposure to medications
that could induce increased ALP expression should be ruled out.
Case Summary and Outcome
Increased ALP secondary to bone disease
In contrast to Spunky (Case 1), Chewie is too old to expect ALP to be elevated due to normal
skeletal growth. No medications that could induce ALP were given. While a lymphopenia may
support a corticosteroid response, the lymphopenia observed in Chewie is very mild and the
rest of the CBC is not consist with a stress or "steroid" leukogram. While some non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory medications have been reported to cause liver failure in some dogs, this is
associated with jaundice and elevations of not only ALP but also ALT and AST, which were not
present in this patient.
Radiographs demonstrated a lytic lesion in the proximal humerus, however thoracic films
were clear of evidence of metastatic disease. Please note that this does not rule out the
presence of microscopic metastases, which are often present at the time of diagnosis of
osteosarcoma. Cytologic evaluation of aspirates from the lytic lesion (Figure 2.1) were
consistent with osteosarcoma. Chewie's limb was amputated, and biopsy showed
osteosarcoma with areas of necrosis and hemorrhage. Dogs with osteosarcoma have shorter
survival times and disease free intervals if the serum ALP is elevated at the time of diagnosis

dilute betadine and lactated ringer's solution for five days. Antibiotics were infused into the
infusion, and several of her skin staples had to be removed for drainage of a mild infection of
her incision. Beauty was discharged and had an uneventtful recovery at home.
Beauty's case illustrates that the need to distinguish extrahepatic causes of enzyme
elevations is important in the horse as well as in small animals. The measurement of SDH,
which is more liver specific than AST in horses, will help the clinician distinguish increases in
AST caused by hepatocellular damage versus increases caused by muscle damage. Anorexia-

Interpretation
CBC
Mature neutrophilic leukocytosis with lymphopenia: The mature neutrophilic eukocytosis
left shift, it may be more compatible with a corticosteroid leukogram. The lymphopenia
dogs include a monocytosis and eosinopenia, neither of which are seen in this case. Some
patients may not have all components of the steroid leukogram at once.
Serum Biochemical Profile
Increased ALP (25% increase) and GGT (16x increase): These enzymes are classically
induced by corticosteroids in the absence of cholestatic disease. Note the serum bilirubin is
within the reference interval.
Increased ALT (3-4x increase): This enzyme is used to detect hepatocellular damage, and
will also increase with administration of corticosteroids.
Case Summary and Outcome
Steroid hepatopathy
Greta's liver enzymes were within the reference interval until her treatment with prednisone
began. Although liver disease is possible, steroids are the most likely cause of the increased
liver enzymes activities seen here. To confirm this interpretation, it is possible to measure the
corticosteroid-ind uced isoenzyme of ALP, which is most often accomplished by levamisole
inhibition. This test is based on the use of levamisole to suppress activity of the liver and bone
isoenzymes in the serum sample. In dogs with normal serum ALP, the corticosteroid induced
isoenzyme makes up about 5-20% of the total ALP. Because hepatobiliary disease has been
reported in association with certain types of inflammatory bowel disease, the possibility of
liver dlisease in Greta should remain on the list of differential diagnoses, especially if liver
enzyme elevations persist following withdrawal of corticosteroid therapy. As always, the
interpretation of elevated ALP in the dog depends significantly on history, clinical signs, and
other laboratory work because of the numerous factors that can cause increased ALP.
In general, administration of corticosteroids causes greater increases in ALP than GGT,
although the degree of increase depends on dose, method of administration, type of
corticosteroid given, and individual sensitivity to the drug. Increases in ALT that are noted in
patients with steroid hepatopathy may be related to areas of focal necrosis /cholestasis that
are seen with the vacuolar hepatopathy induced by steroids
Because of Greta's iatrogenic hyperadrenocorticism, her prednisone was tapered to a lower
dose. Consequently, her inflammatory bowel disease worsened, so another immunosup-
protocol, her clinical signs were under good control. Her liver enzyme values had decreased
but were still slightly elevated (ALP 217 IU/L, GGT 41 TU/L, ALT 118 IU/L).

Interpretation
CBC
Lymphopenia: The mild lymphopenia here may be attributable to stress, however a mature
neutrophilic leukocytosis does not accompany it to support a corticosteroid leukogram.
Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: Differentials include a stress response, post prandial effects, or diabetes
mellitus. Both acute epinephrine release or more chronic corticosteroid release (stress) can
ymphopenia in the CBC supports a stress response. The degree of hyperglycemia is
relatively mild, and while glucosuria and ketonuria are not present, this does not completely
rule out diabetes mellitus. The clinical signs here are nonspecific and also do not help rule
out diabetes. A serum fructosamine level would better reflect chronic glycemic control.
Feline pancreatitis may be associated with either hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
Increased ALP (4x): Nonspecific induction of ALP is rare in the cat compared to the dog, 50
increased ALP is always considered significant in cats. Increased ALP will be seen with many
feline liver diseases, in addition to hyperthyroidism and diabetes mellitus. In contrast, corti-
costeroids donot usually increase ALP in cats.
Increased ALT and AST (2-3x): As for dogs, these increases indicate hepatocellular damage
including increased thyroid hormone. It is not possible to confirm a specific cause ot the
increased liver enzymes based on blood work alone.
Case Summary and Outcome
In this case, hyperthyroidism should be the primary differential diagnosis. This is based on a
combination of the clinical history (weight loss, tachycardia with gallop rhythm, vomiting and
diarrhea) and the laboratory work. Most primary feline liver diseases will be associated with
some degree of hyperbilirubinemia, which is absent here. While diabetes cannot be ruled out
based on the initial laboratory data, the hyperglycemia is mild without significant
abnormalities in the urinalysis. A diagnosis of hyperthyroidism must be confirmed by running
a total T4. Both hyperthyroidism and diabetes mellitus should be ruled out in cats presenting
with liver enzyme elevations prior to performing more invasive diagnostic procedures such as
total T4 of 9 μg/dl (normal is <2.5).
Liver enzyme elevations in hyperthyroid cats are most often reversible with control of their
disease. The cause for the elevations is not clear, however malnutrition, cardiac
complications, and direct toxic effects of thyroid hormone may be factors. Histologic lesions
are generally mild and include fatty infiltration and hepatocellular degeneration and necrosis
There is some evidence that bone ALP contributes to the increased ALP in hyperthyroid cats
Rover's hyperthyroidism was well controlled on a low dose of methimazole. His laboratory
work was closely monitored over the first few months of therapy because of the possibility of
hematologic side effects of the drug and because resolution of the hyperthyroidism can
reveal previously subclinical renal insufficiency in some patients. Rover did not experience any
reactions to the methimazole, nor did he develop azotemia, but his liver enzyme values
normalized.

Cytologic description: Smears contain large numbers of mildly
degenerate neutrophils with intracellular and extracellular bacteria.
Bacteria are large rods that sometimes have focal nonstaining areas
suggestive for spore formation.
No urine could be collected on this patient.

Interpretation
CBC
Leukogram: There is a mild leukopenia with lymphopenia and toxic changes in neutrophils.
Corticosteroid effects could contribute to the lymphopenia, however other elements of the
corticosteroid leukogram such as a neutrophilia and monocytosis are not evident. Toxic
of the patient, further abnormalities of the CBC are expected to develop and a follow up
Platelets: The mild thrombocytopenia is not of the severity that would be expected to result
in spontaneous bleeding in the absence of platelet functional defects. Liver disease and/or a
septic focus could contribute to the decreased platelet count and the mechanism is likely
consumptive. Coagulation studies would help rule out the possibility of disseminated
intravascular coagulation (DIC).
Serum Biochemical Profile
Mild Azotemia: A prerenal cause of the mild azotemia is suspected based on the clinical
history, the absence of other abnormalities corroborating a primary renal problem (e.g.
normal phosphorus, amylase, and hematocrit), and the suggestion of poor perfusion 
concentrated urine specific gravity would help substantiate this interpretation, but a sample
could not be obtained on this patient.
Marked elevation of ALT and AST: There is evidence for significant hepatocellular damage
with hepatocellular enzyme elevations of approximately 100x the upper limit of the reference
interval for both enzymes. Elevation of AST is less specific for liver and could indicate some
muscle damage. A CK might help distinguish the source of the AST but is not clinically
necessary in this case. Unfortunately, these enzyme elevations do not reveal the underlying
cause of the hepatocellular damage, nor are they prognostic.
Liver Enzyme Elevations 
29
Moderate elevation of ALP: The most likely cause of the approximately 10-fold increase in
by the relatively greater elevation in hepatocellular enzymes compared to cholestatic
enzymes. Some degree of enzyme induction is possible, since we speculated about possible
elements of a corticosteroid leukogram. Some reference laboratories offer measurement of
the corticosteroid-induced ALP isoenzyme. As always, a complete drug history should be
taken and other extrahepatic causes of liver enzyme elevations should be ruled out,
especially in the dog (see Table 2-1).
Mild hyperbilirubinemia: The most likely cause for this finding is mild secondary cholestasis
and fits with the interpretation of the elevated ALP. Hemolysis or a significant destruction of
red blood cells appears unlikely in this case, given the normal hematocrit. Sepsis must be
considered as a contributor to hyperbilirubinemia in this patient due to the presence of
bacteria and inflammatory cells in the abdominal fluid. High levels of circulating inflammatory
cytokines such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor directly inhibit the uptake of
bilirubinbyhepatocytes.
Increased anion gap: This is due to an increase in circulating anions that are not routinely
within the reference interval despite the increased anion gap suggests a mixed acid/base
arterial blood gas analysis.

Interpretation
CBC
Leukogram: Neutrophilic leukocytosis with lymphopenia and no morphologic abnormalities is
consistent with corticosteroid-induced changes in the leukogram, although monocytosis is
not present. Despite the absence of toxic changes or a left shift, inflammation is suspected in
addition to corticosteroid effects based on the remainder of the data.
Erythrogram: Mild normocytic normochromic anemia. Possibilities include anemia of chronic
disease (non-regenerative) or acute blood loss with insufficient time to produce a detectable

evidence for an attempt at regeneration, including the increase in polychromasia and
nucleated RBCs. Nucleated RBC's may be related to endothelial cell damage secondary to
shock, although splenic dysfunction is also possible. A reticulocyte count should be done and
successive CBC's should be monitored as needed.
Platelets: The presence of platelet clumps suggests that the platelet count may be
artifactually low and should be repeated on a fresh sample. Such a mild thrombocytopenia is
not of the degree expected to result in spontaneous bleeding in the absence of other
pathology. Liver disease or severe inflammation could contribute to decreased platelets (the

sodium. Vomiting of gastric contents causes loss of chloride, and the chloride tends to vary
inversely with bicarbonate (HCO3). (For full discussion of electrolyte evaluation, see Chapter 7)
Hypokalemia: Patton has several factors that could contribute to hypokalemia.
Gastrointestinal loss through vomiting and/or diarrhea is an important cause. Decreased intake
of potassium in anorectic patients can lead to hypokalemia, most often in combination with
Increased HcO3: This value indicates alkalosis, again related to loss of acid through vomiting

supports cholestasis as the cause for this abnormality. Although the patient is anemic, the
decrement in hematocrit is small and there are no changes in RBC morphology to suggest a
hemolytic mechanism. As noted for Lady (Case 7), sepsis may also impair hepatocellular
uptake of bilirubin. Van den Burgh fractionation of bilirubin in small animal patients is not
rapid equilibration of the conjugated and unconjugated forms of bilirubin.
Marked increase in ALP and GGT: These elevations (roughly 35x and 4x the upper limit of
the reterence interval) are secondary to significant cholestasis in this patient. As always,
contributions from extrahepatic causes of liver enzyme elevations must be considered.
Mild increase in ALT and AST: These elevations (roughly 5x the upper limit of the reference
interval) are mild compared to the increases in the cholestatic enzymes. Based on the relative
increases in enzymes, Patton likely has hepatocellular damage secondary to a primary
cholestatic process.
Hypercholesterolemia: Patton most likely has hypercholesterolemia secondary to cholestasis.
hyperlipidemia.
Abdominocentesis: There is marked, mixed inflammation with pigment indicative of bile
peritonitis (See Figure 2-3).
Liver Enzyme Elevations 
Case Summary and Outcome
Primary cholestasis with secondary hepatocellular damage. Electrolyte and acid/base
abnormalities consistent with vomiting. Bile peritonitis
This case is in contrast to Lady (Case 7), in which hepatocellular damage was the primary
process as seen by the relatively greater elevation of hepatocellular enzymes versus
cholestatic enzymes. In addition to enzyme changes, the marked hyperbilirubinemia and
moderate hypercholesterolemia support a significant cholestatic process. In neither case do
we have available tests of liver function.
Abdominal radiographs of Patton showed free gas in the abdomen highlighting the gall
bladder. During exploratory surgery, an engorged necrotic gall bladder was seen and a 
rupture was present at the liver border, explaining the bile peritonitis. Histologically the
 perforation was accompanied by chronic suppurative inflammation and granulation tissue,
but the cause for the rupture could not be determined. A recent study reports that gall
bladder infarction may be a cause for ruptured gall bladder (Holt). Patients in that stucy had
similar clinicopathologic abnormalities to this patient. After surgery, Patton was treated with
multiple antibiotics and Reglan?. His clinical condlition improved, however he remained blind
in the right eye despite normal papillary light reflexes. The blindness was interpreted to be
secondary to a central event, but the etiology was not investigated further.

Hypoalbuminemia: The degree of hypoalbuminemia is mild. Third space loss of albumin into
the high protein abdominal effusion could contribute to hypoalbuminemia, although
concurrent renal and gastrointestinal losses must be considered. Because albumin is produced
by the liver, markedly decreased liver function could result in hypoalbuminemia, especially if
combined with abnormal losses. Given the liver enzyme elevations, serum bile acids should be

In contrast to Lady and Patton (Cases 7 and 8), it cannot be determined if cholestasis or
hepatocellular damage predominates using the laboratory data for this patient. This case is a
good illustration of the failure of the degree of liver enzyme elevations to provide an accurate
prognosis (Tip 4 in the introduction to the chapter). Despite the presence of significant liver
pathology, enzyme abnormalities were relatively modest (Tip 6).

mild anemia, particularly if the process is chronic. There is often mild to marked thrombocy-
topenia, but since Bruja's platelets were clumped, we cannot determine if this abnormality was
present in her case. Serum biochemical abnormalities include hyperbilirubinemia and elevated
hepatocellular and cholestatic enzymes, as we see in this case. It should be noted that not all
dogs with liver abscesses have elevated ALT or AST (Farrar), so normal hepatocellular enzymes
do not exclude this condition. Nonspecific biochemical abnormalities associated with vomiting
and diarrhea may also be present. Imaging studies are often helpful to distinguish hepatic
abscesses from other causes of liver enzyme elevations, however it may be difficult to
differentiate some lesions such as hepatic cysts, hematomas, and tumors from hepatic
abscesses. Cytologic evaluation of aspirates from these masses can help differentiate these
etiologies, however the potential to spread infection must be considered.

Interpretation
CBC
Leukogram: The leukopenia is characterized by neutropenia and lymphopenia. Differentials
for the neutropenia include consumptive processes such as acute severe inflammation in
which tissue demand for neutrophils exceeds marrow production, immune-mediated
destruction (rare), and/or decreased production. The concurrent presence of a nonregen-
erative anemia could indicate some bone marrow disease, however the degree of anemia is
more compatible with anemia of chronic disease. Lymphopenia may be due to stress
(corticoteroid effects), although viral infection is another possibility that might also explain
damage to other hematopoietic precursors.
Increases in MCHC may be due to intravascular hemolysis, ex vivo rupture of red blood cells
due to sample handling, lipemia, or Heinz bodies.
Serum Biochemical Profile
glucose-containing fluid administration.
Decreased BUN: Decreased production secondary to hepatic insufficiency or dietary protein
restriction may lower BUN. Because liver enzyme activities are elevated and coagulation
times are prolonged, a decreased BUN in this case suggests hepatic insufficiency and the
as a result of diuresis could also contribute to the low BUN in this patient. This patient has
been treated with fluids, calling into question the significance of the urine specific gravity as
an indicator of renal concentrating ability. Serum creatinine is normal, suggesting that renal
function is adequate.
Hypoproteinemia: Although the total protein is low, both albumin and globulins are within
reference ranges. The albumin is at the lower end of the reference range and should be
monitored. If liver function tests support decreased liver function, albumin may continue to
Hyperbilirubinemia: The degree of hyperbilirubinemia is mild, and is compatible with
supported by the increased ALP. The leukopenia and fever suggest that sepsis must be ruled
out as a cause for decreased bilirubin uptake by hepatocytes. Hemolytic disease is less likely

Dervish has decreased liver function based on a plasma ammonia level of 48.0 μM/L
(Reference Interval 0-24). Bile acids are another test of liver function. In general, bile acids are
often the test of choice to evaluate liver function because they are more sensitive than blood
ammonia levels and require less finicky handling. Samples for bile acid measurement do not
have to be kept on ice, or run within 30 minutes, as do samples for blood ammonia.
However, bile acids are of less use in patients with increased bilirubin due to cholestasis anc
may be more useful in those with equivocal liver enzyme levels, normal bilirubin or suspected
hemolysis. Additionally, post-prandial bile acid evels are preferred over fasted for the
detection of decreased liver function in cats. Unfortunately, Dervish's diminished neurologic
function interfered with eating. Ammonia is the only toxin implicated in hepatic
encephalopathy that can be measured clinically, and was a good choice in this case

While Cases 7 and 8 (Lady and Patton) certainly had significant liver disease, there was little
evidence on the serum biochemical profile of decreased liver function. Indicators of
remarkable reserve of liver function in animals, these abnormalities occur very late in disease
decreased liver function on routine laboratory work include decreased BUN, decreased
creatinine (less often), decreased urinary concentrating ability, hypoalbuminemia,
hypoglycemia, hypocholesterolemia, and prolonged clotting times. Evidence for decreased
liver function may occur simultaneously with evidence of hepatocellular damage such as
enzyme elevations, however liver enzyme levels are NOT always abnormal in patients with
markedly high at presentation and begin to drop over time, the patient may be improving, or
alternatively, may be losing functional hepatic mass
Dervish was treated for hepatic encephalopathy and improved following administration of
intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and vitamin K for his coagulopathy. He was discharged from
the hospital without liver biopsy, so the cause for his liver disease was not identified.
Abdominal ultrasound was normal, and serologic testing for FeLV, FlV, and toxoplasmosis was
negative. Liver enzyme values eventually normalized, but Dervish has remained blind. The

elevation of both ALP and GGT, with the exception of hepatic lipidosis in which ALP may

lipidosis should be a primary differential diagnosis in this patient. Because hepatic lipidosis
may be a primary or secondary disorder, the patient should be thoroughly evaluated for any

Binar's case illustrates the possibility of marked liver disease in the absence of dramatic

had decreased liver function associated with marked enzyme elevations and hyperbiliru-
binemia. This made the diagnosis of liver disease more obvious based only on routine

dog than the cat. The same is true for ammonium urate crystalluria, polyuria/polydipsia, and
hypoalbuminemia, although Binar did have low serum protein. When present, liver enzyme
elevations are generally mild with portosystemic shunts, especially in cats. Fasting bile acids
and sometimes fasting ammonia will be within the reference range in some patients because
there may be sufficient functional hepatic mass to extract these substances from the blood
given adequate time. However postprandial bile acids are almost always significantly
elevated and are considered a good screening test for the disease. As noted in the
discussion of Dervish (Case 10), ammonia is the only toxin implicated in hepatic
encephalopathy that can be measured clinically, but sample handling requirements usually
limit its use in private practice.
Binar had a coil surgically placed in his shunt, which attenuated flow through the vessel and
improved his liver function. He was continued on medical management of his condition and
returned to the care of his referring veterinarian.

these organs to regulate the passage of only mature cells into the circulation.

third to one half of dogs with immune-mediated hemolytic anemia also have immune-
mediated thrombocytopenia.
Serum Biochemical Profile
Increased BUN: The cause of the azotemia needs to be determined as prerenal, renal, or
interferes with the creatinine reaction, causing a falsely low result. A prerenal component
hydration status, it is dlifficult to tell if the urine should be expected to be maximally
concentrated (e.g. specific gravity greater than 1.030).
Hypoproteinemia with hypoglobulinemia: The cause for this is unclear, since significant
inflammation would be expected to increase globulins through increased production of both
increased capillary permeability and loss of protein into the interstitium. (See Chapter 4 for
more information on evaluation of proteins)
Severe hyperbilirubinemia: The data on this patient suggest hemolysis as the cause for the
hyperbilirubinemia. The severe, likely regenerative anemia with relatively mild increases in
ALP make cholestasis a less likely etiology for this abnormality. A reticulocyte count may be
performed to quantitate the regenerative response, but because it takes several days after an
acute hemolytic event for the bone marrow to start releasing increased numbers of
reticulocytes, a significant reticulocytosis may not initially be detected.
Mild increase in ALP: An approximately 2 fold elevation in ALP can be dlifficult to interpret in
canine patients. In the absence endocrinopathies or a history of the use of medications that
induce ALP production, hepatic hypoxia seems the most likely cause for this elevation.
Mild to moderate increases in ALT and AST: The 4-5 fold increases in hepatocellular
enzymes are slightly greater than the elevation noted for ALP. Given the clinical history, a
contributing cause for the hepatocellular damage is hypoxia of the hepatocytes along with
ischemic liver lesions that are often described in patients with immune-mediated hemolytic
anemia.

hypoxia.
Rocky had a degree of hyperbilirubinemia comparable to Patton (Case 8), however Rocky
also had severe anemia and mildly increased ALP indicating that hemolysis rather than
cholestasis caused the hyperbilirubinemia. In patients with immune-mediated hemolytic
anemia, hyperbilirubinemia exceeding 5 mg/dL has been shown to correlate with a less
favorable prognosis and is associated with increased risk for thrombosis (Carr). Increased ALP
has also been shown to be a risk factor for thromboembolic complications (Johnson), which
are common in patients with immune-mediated hemolytic anemia. There were slightly greater
previous cases (Lady and Patton, Cases 7 and 8), it is more difficult this time to determine
hemolysis. Hemorrhagic, ischemic, and cholestatic liver lesions have been demonstrated in
necropsy studies ot dogs with immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, and these lesions were
more severe in patients with higher bilirubin levels (McManus).
This patient was Coombs test positive at 1+, and received a blood transfusion along with
corticosteroids, azothiaprine, gastroprotectants, and intravenous fluids. Rocky was released
from the hospital with a guarded to poor prognosis. He did well at home for 2 weeks, at
which point he returned to the hospital with decreased appetite. He was icteric with marked
over night in the intensive care unit, but by the next morning, he had profuse abdomina
effusion that was characterized as a septic suppurative exudlate and was euthanized. At
necropsy, the liver showed evidence of steroid hepatopathy. In adldlition, Rocky had severe
immune-mediated hemolytic anemia.

aggressive monitoring and treatment of hyperglycemia in llamas than in other species due to
this physiological limitation (Cebra 2000).
Hyperproteinemia with hyperglobulinemia: As discussed in the CBC results, these findings
are most compatible with inflammation. Both immunoglobulins and acute phase reactants
can contribute to increased globulins. Mechanisms are dliscussed in Chapter 4. In patients
with inflammatory disease the increase in globulins is usually polyclonal, reflecting enhanced
production of multiple types of proteins. The albumin is at the low end of the reference
range, though not technically abnormal at this time. Decreased liver function could depress
phase reactant. Alternatively, albumin may be lost via the exudative skin lesions in this
patient, or may be associated with a chronically poor nutritional status.
Hyperbilirubinemia: There are several potential etiologies for the mild hyperbilirubinemia in
this case. Causes for increased serum bilirubin include hemolysis, cholestasis, decreased liver
function, and sepsis. Hemolysis cannot be completely ruled out in this patient, however the
serum was not hemolyzed and the PCV is in the low normal range. Cholestasis anc
decreased liver function are possible, although no specific tests of liver function have been

septic process was later confirmed.
Increased AST, SDH, ALP and GGT: Increased AST and SDH with normal CK is most
compatible with hepatocellular damage. ALP and GGT will increase with hepatobiliary
disease, including cholestasis. While the increase in GGT is most remarkable, it is difficult to
determine what process is predominating in this patient based on the laboratory data
presented here.
Case Summary and Outcome
Hepatobiliary disease with inflammation and hyperglycemia
A liver biopsy was performed to help achieve a specific diagnosis and prognosis in this
patient. Sections of liver tissue were characterized by mild to moderate portal fibrosis with
biopsies of the dermallesions revealed epidermal ulceration, intra-epidermal pustules and
intravenous antibiotics, corticosteroids to reduce inflammation in the face, Banamine? for
pain management, and a keratolytic antimicrobial shampoo. Within 24 hours the facial edema
resolved and the patient was comfortable and resumed eating. Peach was discharged, but
died 2 weeks later. At necropsy, persistent pyoderma was noted. In addition, there were 2-3
gallons of peritoneal fluid accompanied by variably-sized, white nodules that were scattered
throughout the liver, kidney, pericardium, and pleura. There was serous atrophy of pericardial
fat, and the pericardium contained 1 mm diameter white nodes and areas were thickened

be the cause of death, and that the primary septic focus was the skin lesions.

or metabolic disorders, which could also have contributed in this case, given the poor body
condition of the animal. Other causes of liver disease that have been reported for llamas are
similar to those for other species and include lipidosis, toxicity, and neoplasia.
As for other species, liver biopsy is often required for a specific diagnosis of hepatobiliary
disease. While the collection of percutaneous biopsy specimens has been shown to be safe in
camelids with minimal subsequent changes in clinical laboratory parameters (Anderson), it is
unclear how well diagnoses based on these small biopsy specimens correlate with samples
collected during abdominal exploratory or at necropsy. In small animal patients, there is
some evidence that significant discordance between diagnoses exists depending on the
method of biopsy collection, possibly due to sampling bias (Cole). That may be why the
original biopsy sample did not reveal the systemic bacterial infection apparent at necropsy.

developed after discharge.

Erythrogram: Stella has a severe anemia. In the equine, reticulocytes are not released into the
circulation during regenerative responses, so it is not generally possible to categorize anemias
as regenerative or nonregenerative based on a single CBC. The presence of Heinz bodies
provide a possible explanation for the source of the anemia, as they reflect oxidative damage
to the red blood cell. When Heinz bodies are observed in the blood of horses, the clinician

Increased BUN: This is likely prerenal as the urine is adequately concentrated.
Hyperproteinemia with hyperglobulinemia: The increased globulins may reflect increases in
explanation for the hyperproteinemia, however concurrent losses of albumin cannot be ruled
out and may mask the effects of dehydration.
Hypochloremia with low normal sodium and low bicarbonate: The low chloride is cispro-
portionate to the change in sodium and is occurring in combination with low bicarbonate, an
indicator of metabolic acidosis. Because chloride generally varies inversely with bicarbonate
(which is NOT the case here), the data support a mixed acid/base disorder. An arterial blood

Increased GGT: Increases in this enzyme reflect hepatobiliary disease or cholestasis.
Increases are seen in periparturient mares and miniature breed horses with fatty liver
syndromes.
Increased AST (5x), LDH (7x) and CK (125% of normal): Increases in AST and LDH can
indicate liver or muscle damage. Because the CK is also elevated, but more modestly
increased than AST and LDH, liver damage is likely responsible for the majority of the
enzyme elevation, with a smaller effect of muscle damage. It should be remembered that
none of these enzymes are considered tests of liver function.

Stella's laboratory abnormalities reflect the complexity of her multiple medical problems. Like
Rocky (Case 13), hypoxia secondary to an acute hemolytic event may have damaged

Coagulation profile: Clotting times are normal at this time. Decreased liver function must be
severe to cause impaired production of coagulation factors, but animals with liver cisease

fibrinolytic enzymes, and the breakdown products of coagulation.

moderate bridging fibrosis, bile duct proliferation, and mild nodular hyperplasia. This was
thought to be suggestive of some form of chronic toxic hepatitis, however a specific cause

Similarly to Stella (Case 15), Skipper was anorectic, contributing to the increased indirect
bilirubin. In contrast to Stella, however, there was no evidence of hemolysis to further
complicate interpretation of increased indirect bilirubin. In addition, Skipper had increased
direct bilirubin, suggesting a significant cholestatic component to her liver disease that was
not evident for Stella. Skipper's AST and CK were within reference ranges, indicating that
concurrent muscle damage was not a factor in this case as it was for Stella. Specific tests of
liver function were not performed for Skipper, but are recommended given her history. At
this time her liver function appears adequate to produce sufficient coagulation proteins, but
this is a very insensitive measure of liver function.

Leukogram: The leukograms on both days 1 and 5 are characterized by a mild, mature
neutrophilic leukocytosis and mild mature lymphocytosis. Potential causes of these changes
include a stress leukogram, with corticosteroid effects contributing to the neutrophilia and
excitement (epinephrine) causing the lymphocytosis. Mild inflammation is also possible,
however there is no morphologic evidence of toxic change or left shift of the neutrophils
Antigenic stimulation also may promote lymphocytosis.
Erythrogram: On day 5, there is a moderate normocytic normochromic anemia. The
significant decrease in hematocrit over 5 days suggests loss of red blood cells. Hemorrhage

evidence of bleeding. Hemolysis is possible, and is supported by the icteric plasma, however

Hypoglycemia: The most common cause of hypoglycemia is tailure to process the sample
appropriately, leading to utilization of glucose by cells in the blood sample. Therefore, it is
to sample handling. A sample should be spun and the serum obtained as soon as the clot
forms, to avoid glucose utilization by blood cells. Drawing the sample into a tube containing
sodium fluoride may also be used to prevent glucose consumption. There are many other

compensated inflammation than sepsis.
Decreased BUN: The most likely cause of low BUN in this patient is decreased liver function.
Other causes could include starvation, polyuria, and overhydration.
Panhypoproteinemia with slightly elevated A:G ratio: Decreased production of albumin
concurrent coagulopathy. Other causes are decreased production secondary to starvation,
however this is unlikely with a normal body condition. Increased loss of protein, primarily by
equal losses of albumin and globulins by Day 5.
The possibility of hemorrhage as a cause for protein loss is supported by the anemia seen on
Day 5. Although there is no history of diarrhea, the patient should be tested for
endoparasites as well as ectoparasites. Renal protein loss seems less likely because globulin
However, proteinuria was noted on the urinalysis, and a urine protein/creatinine ratio should
be determined to clarify potential renal losses of protein. Confirmation of proteinuria is
by dipstick methods.
Decreased HcO3: Low bicarbonate indicates acidemia, but blood gas analysis is required for
complete evaluation. Given the clinical information, acidemia may be due to lactic acidosis

increase in anion gap due to lactic acidosis and the decrease in anion gap due to the hypo-
albuminemia may result in a normal value. This is a good illustration of how multiple
abnormalities may combine to produce an analyte value that falls within the reference interval.
Marked direct and indirect hyperbilirubinemia: Anorexia in horses will cause an increase in
the indirect bilirubin of up to 6-8 mg/dl. The anemia in this horse on day 5 indicates that
hemolysis also could contribute to increased bilirubin. This horse also has strong evidence for
liver disease, including decreased liver function, which will cause increases in both direct and
indirectbilirubin.

this patient liver disease is the more likely cause.
Increased AST, LDH, and SDH: Hepatocellular damage will cause elevations in all of these
enzymes, however AST and LDH may be nonspecific and muscle damage will contribute to
increases as well. In this case, the CK is initially within the reference interval until the patient

Urinalysis: The brown color of the urine and the 3+ Heme reaction is compatible with

can produce similar results. Hemolysis is suspected because numbers of red blood cells in the
acidosis. In this case, the urine is somewhat concentrated, with a specific gravity of 1.026.
Liver failure may lead to suboptimal urinary concentrating ability because of lack of urea for
generation of gradient for concentration, among other mechanisms. The presence of

resulting in a false positive.

and FDP's are not elevated. Fibrinogen (100 mg/dl) might be low due to impaired synthesis
secondary to liver dysfunction. Low fibrinogen is less often a feature of DIC in large animals 
compared to small animals because of the capacity of domestic large animal species to
anticoagulants, which may produce similar prolongation of the PT and APTT.
Case Summary and Outcome
Decreased liver function with evidence of hepatocellular damage and cholestasis.
Possible hemolytic anemia secondary to liver failure, or hemorrhage related to a
coagulapathy resulting from liver disease.
On day 6 of hospitalization, the colt began moaning, lying down, and looking at his flanks,
although gut sounds were normal. He continued to pass red-brown urine, and his PCV
dropped to 10%. Later that day he developed epistaxis. His coagulation parameters
normalized after transfusions of blood and fresh frozen plasma, and no further bleeding was
noted. The next day he became more obtunded and ataxic, developed ventral edema, and
had a precipitous fall in his PCV. He was euthanized due to lack of response to therapy and
poor prognosis. At necropsy, the foal's liver was small, and histologic examination revealed
severe portal and midzonal chronic active necrotizing hepatitis with intrahepatic cholestasis.
Grossly, the kidneys showed green/brown discoloration. Histologically, there was moderate
multifocal, subacute tubular necrosis and pigmented granular casts, compatible with
hemoglobin nephropathy.

The cause of the liver disease in Flower was never confirmed, however potential differentials
should include infectious disease such as Tyzzer's disease, immune-mediated disease such as
Theiler's disease (although unlikely in this young animal), exposure to hepatotoxins, or a
ornithinemia-homocitrullinuria syndrome in people.
This case should be compared with Stella (Case 15), who also had concurrent hemolysis and
liver disease. In both these cases, the combination of anorexia, liver disease, and severe
disease because of her normal hemogram.
Severe acute anemia will often cause hepatocellular damage secondary to poor oxygenation
of tissues. As seen with both this foal and Stella, muscle tissue may also suffer hypoxic
damage. Therefore, it may be difficult to interpret the elevation of enzymes that occur in
both tissues, such as AST and LDH. The Heinz bodies present in Stella's blood suggested a
mechanism for the hemolysis. For Flower, the normal red blood cell morphology made it
more difficult to determine the cause for the anemia. No agglutination was observed to
suggest immune-mediated mechanisms, although a Coomb's test was not performed. Red
blood cell parasites were not detected on microscopic examination of blood films. The
brown urine suggested intravascular hemolysis, but a cause could not be found. The
presumptive cause for hemolysis in this patient was liver failure, however hemolysis was not
described in the Morgan foal hepatopathy report. A hemolytic syndrome associated with
increased erythrocyte fragility has been described as a near terminal event in horses with
severe liver failure.

Liver Case 18 - Level 2
"Hilda" is a 10-year-old spayed female Doberman presenting for lethargy, vomiting, and
anorexia. She had a gastric dilatation volvulus 3 months ago and has been on carprofen for
arthritis for the past 2 years. She has also been on phenylpropanolamine for urinary
incontinence and is a carrier for the von Willebrands trait. Hilda has been anorectic for
several days. She will drink water, though she vomits it up afterwards. She has become
progressively more lethargic to the point of not rising more than once a day. She has watery
diarrhea once a day. The dog frequently receives high fat treats such as Danish pastries,
cheesecake, bread and butter, and cat food.
On physical examination, Hilda is dull and lethargic with sunken eyes. She has mild
conjunctivitis, and her sclera are yellow. Auscultation is within normal limits, and her capillary
refill time is less than two seconds. Temperature, pulse and respirations are normal. She has
several arge lipomatous masses.

Leukogram: Hilda has a mild mature neutrophilia with lymphopenia, possibly due to

filtration rate. In combination with the isosthenuric urine, the azotemia can be classified as
evaluation of acid/base disturbances.
Increased anion gap: A likely source of unmeasured anions in this patient could be uremic
Hyperbilirubinemia: In the absence of anemia or other evidence for significant hemolysis and
given the liver enzyme elevations, cholestasis is the cause for the hyperbilirubinemia.
Increased ALP (13-15x): If there is no apparent cause for enzyme induction, increased ALP is
Interpreted as evidence for cholestasis. The GGT is at the upper limit of the reference range
and should be monitored for increases.
Increased ALT and AST (2x and 6x): Hepatocellular damage is occurring concurrently with
cholestasis and could be secondary to the damaging effects of bile on the hepatocytes.
Increased amylase and lipase: Given the history of vomiting and diarrhea along with a high
fat diet, pancreatitis is possible. Clinicians should be aware, however, that decreased
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) can result in increased amylase and lipase. Generally,
decreased GFR will cause relatively minor elevations in pancreatic enzymes, often 2-4x the
upper limit of the reference range.

Case Summary and Outcome
Renal azotemia with cholestasis and hepatocellular damage, possible pancreatitis
As has been stated previously, the serum biochemical profile can rarely point to the specific
cause of liver disease. In this case, there is evidence of cholestasis and hepatocellular
damage, however the available laboratory indicators of liver function (blood ammonia,
coagulation times, serum albumin) are normal. The combination of renal azotemia and
elevated liver enzymes in canine patients should trigger the suspicion of leptospirosis in areas
where this dlisease occurs. Unlike dogs with leptospirosis, clinical signs are generally mild or
inapparent in infected cats, despite inflammation in the kidney and liver.
Initial leptospirosis titers for Hilda were negative, but convalescent titers were 1:6,400 for
four fold or greater increase in titers support a diagnosis of leptospirosis. Replication of the
leptospire organism causes liver and kidney damage, and renal colonization can be long term.
In the liver, the toxins produced by the organisms may cause subcellular damage that is not
reflected by histologic changes. Intrahepatic cholestasis results from inflammation in the liver.
Hilda was hospitalized for several weeks for treatment for leptospirosis and for supportive
care while her renal function returned. She was discharged to the care of her referring
veterinarian.

"Lily" is a 7-year-old spayed female domestic short haired cat who presented with a one day
history of severe lethargy and anorexia. According to the owner, Lily is drinking a lot and has
been lying next to the water bowl. Her litter box was very wet this morning, but another cat
does share the litter box. Lily is an indoor cat that eats "strange" things such as lemon grass,
aloe, and pieces of plastic. The owner reports that she was normal until yesterdlay, with a
normal appetite and the cat has not lost weight. On physical examination, Lily was febrile,
icteric, and had a painful abdomen. A cranial abdominal mass was palpated.

endocrinopathies such as diabetes mellitus or hyperthyroidism, or pancreatitis. Blood glucose
levels >300 mg/dl have been seen in stressed cats in the absence of diabetes mellitus, and
stress hyperglycemia may be exaggerated in sick cats (Rand). A urinalysis is not available, but 
this degree of hyperglycemia may result in glucosuria regardless of the initiating cause.
Hypocalcemia:
Differentials for hypocalcemia associated with a normal serum albumin and normal
phosphorus concentrations include pancreatitis and malabsorption. Other causes of
hypocalcemia such as renal failure and hypoparathyroidism are usually, but not always,
associated with hyperphosphatemia. See Chapter 6 on calcium and phosphorus for a more
complete discussion of mineral metabolism.
Hyponatremia and hypochloremia: Electrolyte abnormalities will be discussed more
thoroughly in Chapter 7. In this case, the hyponatremia likely reflects osmotic shifts in water

Hyperbilirubinemia: Major rule outs for hyperbilirubinemia include hepatobiliary disease and
hemolysis. In combination with the serum enzyme elevations, liver disease is strongly
suspected. The anemia here is mild and nonregenerative, suggesting that a clinically
significant hemolytic event is unlikely.
Increased ALP (5x): Potential causes for this elevation include cholestasis or
case (Case 6), nonspecific elevations in ALP are rare in the cat, so increased ALP is always
considered significant. Increases in ALP secondary to diabetes mellitus usually are <500 IU/L,
as seen here. While hyperglycemia provides some evidence for diabetes mellitus, the hyper-
bilirubinemia indicates high potential for cholestasis. An increased ALP with normal GGT
should flag hepatic lipidosis as a potential differential diagnosis, however other liver diseases
cannot be ruled out.
Increased ALT and AST (2x and 10x): These enzymes indicate hepatocellular damage and
support similar dlifferential diagnoses listed for increased ALP.
Case Summary and Outcome
disease with mild non-regenerative anemia.
Abdominal ultrasound of Lily revealed a mild abdominal effusion. The abdominal mass proved
diagnosed with pancreatitis, and this was interpreted to be the inflammatory focus that caused
the neutropenia with left shift and toxic changes. Lily was treated with broad spectrum
antibiotics, intravenous fluids, and insulin. An esophagotomy tube was placed for nutritional
support. A liver biopsy was recommended if her liver enzymes did not normalize. Unfortunately
Serum liver enzyme concentrations are often increased in patients with pancreatitis, possibly
secondary to ischemia. In cats with pancreatitis, hyperbilirubinemia may reflect severe
hepatocellular damage or intrahepatic or extrahepatic obstruction of bile flow.
transiently or permanently diabetic after developing pancreatitis due to damage to islet cells
in hypocalcemia secondary to pancreatitis is uncertain but may relate to saponification of
peripancreatic fat or increased calcium uptake by muscle. Because pancreatitis in cats is
frequently associated with non-pancreatic conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease,
diabetes mellitus, or neoplasia, interpretation of blood work can be complex in these cases
cannot be ruled out, though the combination of pancreatitis and diabetes mellitus are
sufficient to explain her laboratory abnormalities.
54
This case should be compared with Rover (Case 6), the hyperthyroid cat with hyperglycemia
and elevated liver enzymes associated with hyperthyroidism. Lily's hyperbilirubinemia helps
support more significant hepatic pathology than was expected for Rover. The normal amylase
is a poor test for pancreatitis in cats, and cases of suspected pancreatitis should have
samples submitted for lipase or trypsin-like immunoreactivty (TLl) that will be discussed in
more detail in a later chapter.

Azotemia: Complete interpretation of the significance of this finding requires a urine specific
gravity, which is not available. Pre-renal and renal azotemia are most likely since the ferret is
urinating. It should be noted that serum creatinine is even less sensitive an indicator of rena
dysfunction in ferrets than it is in dogs and cats, and this value will rarely exceed 2.0 or 3.0,

buminemia. Because a fraction of serum calcium is complexed with albumin, hypoalbu-
minemia may lead to decreases in total serum calcium, while ionized calcium will often be
normal. Formulas generated for correction of serum calcium for low albumin have been
 generated for the dog, but cannot be extrapolated to other species.

Case Summary and Outcome
Hepatocellular damage with mild secondary cholestasis, azotemia, and hypoproteinemia.
Possible differential diagnoses in this ferret include gastritis and ulceration, renal failure,
ingestion of a gastrointestinal foreign body with prerenal azotemia, hepatic neoplasia, and
toxicity. Further inquiry into the history ot this patient revealed that the owner had found a
fragment of a 200 mg tablet of ibuprofen on the floor of her apartment the evening of onset
they have been known to pry tops off of bottles ot medication or to chew open containers.
While the pharmacologic properties of ibuprofen have not been thoroughly studied in the
ferret, acute renal insufficiency, liver disease, and hypoalbuminemia have been reported in
human cases of ibuprofen intoxication. Ibuprofen inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, and can
decrease renal blood flow and GFR. Renal and gastrointestinal signs dominate in dogs with
ibuprofen toxicity, while very high doses may result in central nervous system signs. This
ferret presented with decreased mentation. A recent study of ibuprofen ingestion in ferrets
reported that 93% of affected animals had neurologic signs, while 55% had gastrointestinal
signs such as anorexia, vomiting, gagging, diarrhea or melena (Richardson). Signs of renal
of ibuprofen than are cats.

anemia, and an apparent thrombocytopenia. A manual platelet count is recommended to
quantitate the low count. Sepsis with disseminated intravascular coagulation may cause the
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and prolonged coagulation times. If extramarrow causes of
the pancytopenia are not found, a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy should be considered to
investigate this problem.

hyperbilirubinemia, elevated liver enzymes and hyperammonemia. Sepsis could be an issue

Hyperproteinemia with hypoalbuminemia and hyperglobulinemia: Mechanisms for hypoal-
buminemia may include decreased hepatic production, increased losses through the gut,
kidney, third space or cutaneous esions and/or secondary to malnutrition/starvation. Because
only approximately one third of liver function is required to maintain production of albumin,
compounded by losses through the gastrointestinal tract as a result of diarrhea. Albumin
be seen associated with increased production of acute phase reactants by the liver during
inflammation, by increased production of immunoglobulins secondary to antigenic
stimulation, or by autonomous antibody production by neoplastic lymphocytes or plasma
cells. Serum protein electrophoresis may be performed to distinguish reactive hyperglobu-
linemia (usually polyclonal) from paraneoplastic hyperglobulinemia (usually monoclonal).
Polyclonal gammopathy has been reported in canine and feline patients with chronic liver
disease, possibly related to decreased Kupffer cell function. This leads to increased exposure
of the body to antigens normally cleared from the portal blood. The development of
autoantibodies has also been described in association with chronic liver disease. In Snoopy.
the decrease in albumin combined with the marked increase in globulins resulted in a low

blocking of canaliculi or failure by damaged hepatocytes to clear and process bilirubin. In this
case, it is likely a combination of both mechanisms. Impaired bilirubin uptake by hepatocytes
secondary to the effect of endotoxin also may play a role.

secondary to significant hepatic parenchymal loss. Given the thrombocytopenia, the potential
for DlC should be considered. This coagulopathy will have to be addressed prior to any
biopsy procedures.
Case Summary and Outcome
Hepatocellular damage and decreased liver function
Snoopy was treated with fresh frozen plasma to help normalize her clotting factors, and was
given antibiotics due to her fever and neutropenia. Further diagnostic tests included a liver
aspirate and bone marrow aspirate. Many large lymphoblasts mixed with small clusters of
bone marrow aspirate included many hypercellular particles, consisting of 66% large
lymphoblasts similar to those seen in the liver aspirate. Lucy had granulocytic, erythroid, and
megakaryocytic hypoplasia. Cytology of the liver and bone marrow were consistent with a
diagnosis ot lymphoma.
Lucy underwent chemotherapy for her lymphoma, and her liver function transiently improved.
She remained persistently neutropenic and intermittently was thrombocytopenic and/or
anemic. After two months of therapy, Lucy was euthanized after developing abdominal pain
and effusion, respiratory distress, and anorexia.
In this case, dliffuse infiltration of the liver by neoplastic cells resulted in impaired liver
function. Clinical pathology findings associated with either primary or metastatic neoplasia of
the liver are quite variable and do not show a consistent pattern. Some patients present with
multiple laboratory abnormalities associated with liver disease, while others may have
completely normal blood work. Because serum biochemical data rarely leads to a specific
classification of the liver disease, liver cytology or preferably biopsy is required to establish
the presence of neoplasia.

Step 2: Using laboratory indicators, categorize the patient as having significant
hepatocellular damage (Cases 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21), cholestasis
(Cases 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21) or decreased liver function (Cases 10,
11, 12, 15, 17, 21). Please note the significant overlap; many patients have more than one
process occurring in the diseased liver.
Step 3: Using the relative increases in laboratory parameters that indicate hepatocellular
damage (Case 7, 21), cholestasis (Case 8, 16) and decreased liver function (Case 12), attempt
to prioritize which process is likely to be the primary issue. This is not possible in all cases
(Ca5es 9, 10, 11, 13, 19).
Step 4: For ALL of these cases, information in addlition to what could be obtained from routine
laboratory work alone was required for specific diagnosis and treatment of patients. In almost
all cases, the history and physical were strong indicators of the cause of disease (Cases 1, 2, 4,
5, 7, 15, 20), while many required additional laboratory testing (Cases 6, 7, 18), imaging studies
(Cases 3, 9, 12, 19), and/or cytology/biopsy (Cases 3, 8, 11, 14, 16, 21). This reinforces the
concept that laboratory data must be interpreted within the context of clinical information.

Tests of the Gastrointestinal System and
Carbohydrate Metabolism
The serum biochemical profile includes the measurement of multiple analytes that assist with
the diagnosis of gastrointestinal disease, including pancreatic enzymes, cholesterol,
triglycerides, and glucose. As we saw in the chapter on liver enzymes, diseases of other organ
systems also may cause abnormal results for these tests. Many metabolic and endocrine
disorders may influence parameters that are included in this section. In addition, significant
of gastrointestinal disease often requires additional specialty laboratory testing that is not
performed as part of the routine biochemical profile (for example, trypsin-like immunoreac-
tivity or cobalamine/Vitamin B12 levels). As always, other diagnostic modalities such as
imaging studies and cytology or biopsy are often required for confirmation of diagnosis.
Guidelines for Interpretation of Serum Amylase and Lipase
1. Pancreatitis should be ruled out in patients with increased serum amylase or lipase, however
the sensitivity and specificity of these tests for pancreatic disease are not optimal. The degree
of enzyme elevation does not correlate with the severity of histologic changes in the pancreas.
2. Decreased glomerular filtration rate can increase the serum amylase and lipase up to two
to three times the upper limit of the reference range.
3. Dexamethasone treatment may increase serum lipase concentrations. In contrast, serum
amylase may decrease in healthy dogs treated with corticosteroids (Williams).
4. Serum amylase and lipase may increase with extrapancreatic pathology, including intestinal
and hepatic disease.
5. Neither serum amylase nor lipase is a good indicator of pancreatitis in cats (Gerhardt)
6. Serum and abdominal fluid amylase and lipase are frequently increased in New World
camelids presenting tor pancreatic necrosis (Pearson).
7. Pancreatitis is rare in cattle and horses. Serum and abdominal fluid amylase and lipase may
8. As was described for serum liver enzyme levels, amylase and lipase values that fall below
insufficiency.
The interpretation of cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose is much more complex than that
of the pancreatic enzymes.
Interpretation of Serum Cholesterol
1. There are many causes of hypercholesterolemia
2. Some drugs may alter serum cholesterol levels (L-asparaginase, azathioprine, corticos-
teroids, methimazole, and others) so a careful medication history should be taken
protein-losing enteropathy, severe prolonged liver failure, or malnutrition.

Interpretation of Serum Triglycerides
1. Increased serum triglycerides cause a milky appearance to the serum or plasma (lipemia).
Increased serum cholesterol will not do this.
2. Post-prandial effects are the most common cause of elevated triglycerides and should
always be ruled out first.
3. Causes for hypertriglyceridemia are similar to those listed above for hypercholesterolemia.
4. Only rarely have drugs been reported to influence serum triglyceride levels.
5. Idiopathic syndromes associated with hyperlipidemia (hyperlipidemia is either increased
cholesterol and/or triglycerides) have been reported.
6. Low serum triglycerides are generally not considered clinically important.
Interpretation of Serum Glucose
A note on methodology: Although the focus of this manual is on interpretation of data rather
than the technical aspects of assays, the use of small, portable glucometers is common and 
therefore worth mentioning. There are many types of these analyzers, and a thorough review
is beyond this chapter; however recent research has shown that data from these glucometers
appears to slightly underestimate glucose levels determined by reference methods in most 
cases. The differences are most often small, and not clinically significant, but are greatest at
(Wess and Reusch, Wess, and Cohn).
Hypoglycemia
1. Always rule out artifactual hypoglycemia first, especially if the patient does not appear
to have clinical signs associated with hypoglycemia. Serum or plasma should be separated
from cells within 30 minutes of sample collection to avoid consumption of glucose by cells
Tests of the Gastrointestinal System and Cabohydrate Metabolism
75
within the sample. High leukocyte or platelet counts in the blood may accelerate the
consumption of glucose within the sample. Collection of samples into tubes containing
sodium fluoride will prevent consumption of glucose by the cells
2. Sepsis is a common cause of hypoglycemia.
3. Various neoplasms will cause excessive uptake of glucose by tissues due to the production
of abnormal insulin like growth factors (mesenchymal, epithelial, or hematopoietic tumors;
especially large tumors occurring in the chest or abdomen) or the production of insulin (beta
cell tumors).
4. Hypoglycemia may occur with hepatic insufficiency as a result of impaired gluconeogenesis
and/or failure to clear insulin.
5.Juvenile hypoglycemia is seen in pigs or small breed dogs due to impaired gluconeogenesis.
6. Less common causes of hypoglycemia are starvation, malabsorption, or glycogen storage
diseases.
Hyperglycemia
increased cholesterol and triglycerides.
 2. Stress (corticosteroid effects) and excitement (epinephrine release) will increase serum
observed in diabetes mellitus, especially in cats (Rand), and can potentially result in glucosuria.
Sympathoadrenal response to head trauma can also result in hyperglycemia (Syring)
3. Diabetes mellitus is an important cause of hyperglycemia, but must be differentiated from
the previous two common causes.
4. Administration of corticosteroids or dextrose containing solutions will increase blood glucose
with hyperglycemia.
6. Some drugs, such as xylazine, may cause hyperglycemia. This is an important consideration
if a dlifficult patient must be anesthetized to obtain a blood sample.

Case Summary and Outcome
Gilligan's owners were instructed to fast him overnight prior to the collection of the blood
sample; however their 6-year-old son had fed the dog a large can of dog food three hours
prior to the appointment. A serum biochemical profile performed on a fasted blood sample
the next day did not contain laboratory abnormalities.
Hyperlipidemia is a general term used to describe the presence of excess lipid (cholesterol or
triglycerides) in the blood. Only increased serum triglyceride concentrations cause
Hypercholesterolemia may cause a slight haziness, but not the marked turbidity that is seen
with increased triglycerides. Note the difference between hyperlipidemia and hyperlipemia:
The most common cause of lipemia in the dog is post-prandial effects. An eight to ten hour
fast should be sufficient to clear the blood of lipids. Serum triglycerides may be significantly
elevated after eating, however the increase in cholesterol is generally mild and often remains
within the upper limit of the reference range. Patients with fasting hyperlipidemia should be
evaluated for causes of secondary hyperlipidemia such as pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus,
is persistent despite fasting, and there is no evidence of concurrent diseases that elevate
lipids, then primary idiopathic hyperlipidemia should be considered. Idiopathic
hyperlipidemia is most commonly seen in miniature schnauzers and beagles, but occasionally

The transport of lipids in the blood requires that they be associated with proteins to enhance
solubility. These lipid protein complexes vary in size, density, electrical charge, composition,
and metabolic function. The relative proportions of different types of complexes can be
characterized by density centrifugation, electrophoretic mobility, chromatography, or
more research is required before these tests are likely to be widely applied in clinical
veterinary practice.

CBC: This patient has a mature neutrophilic leukocytosis, a mature lymphocytosis, and a

Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: Based on the history, the primary rule out for hyperglycemia should be
stress. Anesthesia can result in epinephrine release as well. Xylazine is a commonly used
sedative/analgestic that interferes with insulin release and may result in a transient
hyperglycemia which may be severe enough to cause a glucosuria. Post-prandial effects may
be ruled out by determining the time of the last meal but are less likely with high protein,
low carbohydrate cat foods. (Note that in Case 1, Gilligan had recently eaten, but had blooc
glucose levels within the reference interval) Diabetes remains on the list of differential
diagnoses, however there is little support for this diagnosis based on clinical signs or
laboratory data. Other laboratory abnormalities often associated with diabetes such as
glucosuria, hypercholesterolemia, and elevated liver enzymes are absent.
Case Summary and Outcome
Marmalade's hyperglycemia was caused by a combination of stress and anesthesia. In some
cases, repeat sampling when the cat is less stressed, or having the owner obtain blood at home
will result in normal blood glucose determinations (Casella, Reusch). In Marmalade's case,
however, any degree of handling with medical intent was not well received. The absence of
glucosuria is helpful here, however stress induced hyperglycemia may result in blood glucose
concentrations that exceed the renal threshold for reabsorption (approximately 200 mg/dl) for
extended periods of time in anxious cats. A recent report showed that some healthy stressed
cats had blood glucose concentrations in the diabetic range for as long as 90-120 minutes after
the stressor (Rand).
The serum fructosamine test is available to help discriminate stress-induced hyperglycemia from
diabetes mellitus. Serum fructosamine levels reflect the amount of plasma proteins that have
Undergone irreversible, non-enzymatic glycation in the presence of hyperglycemia.
the proteins in the serum, thus averaging the blood glucose concentration over the preceeding
few weeks in the patient. This is a great advantage over blood glucose concentrations, which
reflect only the immediate situation and may be altered by numerous variables. Serum
fructosamine has been shown to be a useful test for differentiating stress hyperglycemia from
diabetes and could be performed in patients where the clinical history and physical exam make
this distinction less clear (Crenshaw).

Hypoglycemia: Because this patient does not have any clinical signs referable to
hypoglycemia, laboratory artifact should be ruled out prior to invasive or expensive work-up
for other conditions that cause hypoglycemia. Resubmission of a freshly collected sample

Potassium may also leak from cells if there is a significant delay in separating the cells from
the serum. In the absence of clinical signs, an individual analyte value that falls slightly
outside the reference interval could be "normal" for this particular patient as a result of
biological variation (see introductory chapter on the development of reference intervals).
Repeat analysis may reveal that the analyte falls back into the reference interval. If repeat
abnormalities, further diagnostic work may be indicated.

significant delay between the collection of this sample and centrifugation, leading to
evidence of sepsis, liver failure, neoplasia, or nutritional deficits. Repeat sampling revealed

"Kippy" is a 12-year-old neutered male poodle presenting for lethargy of two weeks duration
and progressive abdominal distention. His appetite has been decreased for two days and he
has vomited once. On physical examination, Kippy's abdomen is very distended and a fluid
wave is palpable. His hair coat is sparse and he has numerous subcutaneous masses. He has a
low-grade fever. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a very large abdominal mass that
encompasses a large portion of the abdominal cavity and is compressing the stomach and
bladder. The mass appears to arise from the liver, is attached by a pedicle, and contains 
numerous cystic structures.

Interpretation
CBC: Kippy has a neutrophilic leukocytosis with a left shift and toxic change, indicating 
significant inflammation. His anemia is macrocytic hypochromic, therefore likely regenerative,
although a reticulocyte count is required to quantitate the response. The increased numbers
of nucleated erythrocytes may have entered the circulation as part of a regenerative
response or as a result of endothelial insult (i.e. hypoglycemia, hypoxia, endotoxemia) or
abnormality of hematopoietic tissues. Moderate thrombocytopenia is likely due to increased
consumption of platelets; decreased production is less likely based on the good activity in
endothelium or may be consumed as a result of early DlC. A coagulation profile would help
clarify the status of hemostasis in this patient.

improvement of the hematologic abnormalities, eliminating concern for other potential
causes of the hypoglycemia. Note that the clinical chemistry data for Gretchen (Case 4) and
Kippy are almost identical, and yet Gretchen's hypoglycemia was artifactual and of no
disease. The comparison of the two cases highlights the need to interpret clinical chemistry
for significant disease in Kippy's case.
Tumor associated hypoglycemia has been reported in people and dogs, and possibly in
horses (Bagley, Baker, Beaudry). Mesenchymal, epithelial, and hematopoietic tumors may
 cause hypoglycemia. Mesenchymal and epithelial tumors are often large and occur in the
chest or abdomen. Although these tumors could consume substantial amounts of glucose,
another mechanism has been shown to be the critical factor causing hypoglycemia. In many
cases, these tumors secrete incompletely processed insulin-like growth factor ll (IGF-ll), a
hormone that causes hypoglycemia by activating the insulin receptor (Le Roth). Normally,
84
4 Manual of Veterinary Clinical Chemistry: A Case Study Approach
IGF-ll is produced in the liver. After secretion into the circulation, IGF-ll forms a complex with
a binding protein which limits the biological activity. In contrast, the abnormally processed
IGF-ll produced by tumors does not complex with the binding protein, and therefore it is free
to interact with the insulin receptor to inhibit glucose production by the liver, thus increasing
peripheral uptake of glucose by other tissues.
A retrospective study of dogs with massive hepatocellular carcinoma showed that the
majority of patients had elevations in three or more serum liver enzyme activities, and that
elevations in serum ALT and AST were negative prognostic indicators (Liptak). Despite this,

true hyperglycemia is considered to be present in this patient. Although there are numerous
Mildly increased in ALT and AST: With the exception of liver tumors, primary hepatic
dlisease is rare in ferrets. In ferrets, repeated bouts of hypoglycemia will mobilize fat stores to
the liver, causing hepatocellular swelling and increased liver enzymes. The possibility of
metastasis of an insulinoma must also be considered.
Case Summary and Outcome
This patient was initially managed conservatively with medical therapy, which included
for a period of time, ldes continued to have periods of lethargy and weakness, but no further
episodes of collapse. ldes was eventually taken to surgery, and three firm pancreatic nodules
were palpated and removed, and a liver biopsy was performed. Histologic examination of
tissues revealed multiple benign insulinomas and glycogen infiltration of hepatocytes with no
evidence of metastatic disease. Ides was discharged and recovered uneventfully. Like Kippy.
the remainder of the clinical chemistry profile was relatively unremarkable despite the
presence of neoplasia. This may be the case with many types of tumors. When measured,
patients with insulinoma have normal to high insulin levels associated with hypoglycemia,
86 Manmual of Veterinary Clinical Chemisty: A Case Study Approach
while patients with other malignancies that cause hypoglycemia often have appropriately low
circulating insulin.
Insulinomas are one of the most common tumors in middle-aged ferrets, and they may be
present concurrently with other common tumors of ferrets such as adrenal tumors. Clinical
signs result from pronounced hypoglycemia secondary to continuous hyperinsulinemia. The
normal counter-regulatory mechanisms that increase blood glucose concentrations in
glucagon, cortisol, epinephrine, and growth hormone) are not fully operational in ferrets with
insulinoma. A blood glucose value of <60 mg/dl in the absence of clinical signs or laboratory
abnormalities suggesting another cause for hyperglycemia is considered diagnostic.
Measurement of blood glucose should be performed on multi-test automated biochemistry
analyzers to avoid the wide variation of results that may be obtained by the use of hand-held
glucometers at low serum glucose values. Insulin levels may be measured, and are normal or
elevated in the presence of hypoglycemia. Some authors advocate the use of suggestive
clinical signs and intermittent hypoglycemia for diagnosis without measurement of serum 
insulin values because these values may be normal in some ferrets with insulinoma. Definitive
diagnosis requires histologic examination of pancreatic nodules, which may be difficult to
detect without surgery. As noted above, initially medical management alone may be
clinical signs and/or improved medical management for 2-6 months after surgery. However,
surgical treatment is often not curative because of the frequent presence of microscopic
insulinomas that are not identified and removed.

Interpretation
CBC: The CBC is unremarkable except for a mild decrease in the RBC count. This may
indicate a developing mild anemia of chronic disease since the hematocrit is at the low end
of the reference interval. Alternatively, these values may be normal for this patient as a result
of normal biological variation. Repeat blood work could be considered to determine if there
is a decreasing trend in the erythrocyte values.
Serum Biochemical Profile
Hypoglycemia: Once processing errors were ruled out, true hypoglycemia was suspected
based on the "seizure" episodes. The pancreatic nodule is of concern, and insulinoma should
be considered. Simultaneous measurement of glucose and insulin levels under fasted
conditions are recommended. Impaired gluconeogenesis associated with liver failure can
cause hypoglycemia (see Chapter 2, Case 21), although this is relatively uncommon. Other
laboratory abnormalities associated with markedly decreased liver function include hypoalbu-
minemia, hypocholesterolemia, prolonged PT and APTT and occasionally mild hyperbiliru-

of measured parameters on the clinical chemistry profiles are sensitive or specific for the
detection of decreased liver function, measurement of serum bile acids and/or blood
ammonia are recommended because of the small liver. Remember that normal liver enzyme
levels in the blood do not rule out liver disease. Clinical and laboratory findings make sepsis
extremely unlikely.

absence of other physical or laboratory evidence of liver disease, the significance of this
elevation is unclear. Repeat sampling in 4-6 weeks is recommended, or sooner if the clinical
condition changes.

Case Summary and Outcome
An aspirate smear of the liver was evaluated and found to be normal. Simultaneous fasting
glucose and insulin levels were performed. Insulin was 48.8 IU/ml with a fasting glucose was 56
mg/dl, compatible with insulinoma. Normally insulin should be 2-25 IU/ml when glucose is
between 70-100. Russell was treated with corticosteroids, frequent meals and avoidance of
strenuous exercise until his tumor was surgically removed and confirmed to be an insulinoma by
histologic examination of biopsy specimens. Unfortunately, resection was incomplete. Russell
continued to do well at home on corticosteroid therapy for 18 months, after which he
presented again after a low glucose measurement at the referring veterinarian's clinic. This
Repeat blood work at this time confirmed the low glucose and revealed a corticosteroid
leukogram and elevated ALP, which may be attributed to corticosteroid treatment, though
other ca uses cannot be ruled out.
Although thoracic radiographs were clear of metastases, abdominal ultrasound showed
multiple liver nodules. Cytology of these nodules revealed small numbers of normal
hepatocytes with sheets and small clusters of cells indicative of a neuroendocrine tumor
compatible with insulinoma (Figure 3-3). Fasting insulin level measured on the same serum as
the 18-month serum biochemical profile was 264 IU/ml, compatible with recurrence of
disease. Russell was discharged from the hospital on medical therapy with a guarded
prognosis.
This case was initially referred in for evaluation of liver disease, which was never definitively
ruled out, however seemed unlikely to be the primary cause of the clinical signs given the
compatible with poor hepatic function, but as noted above, other supportive laboratory data
were lacking. The clinical presentation and laboratory findings were similar to the same disease
in Ides, the ferret in the previous case. Interestingly, despite the confirmed presence of
metastatic disease in the liver, hepatic enzyme changes were minimal and likely related to the
corticosteroid therapy. This is similar to Kippy, who had an extremely large liver tumor and
mostly unremarkable liver enzyme data

Based on the age of the patient, neoplasia is very unlikely.
Decreased BUN: Hepatic insufficiency and dietary protein restriction may result in BUN
below the reference range. Increased excretion with polyuria can contribute as well.
Hypoproteinemia with hypoalbuminemia: Hypoalbuminemia may result from decreased
production, increased losses, or a combination of both causes. Some degree of intestinall
protein loss is possible and suggested by the history, but decreased production secondary to
poor liver function also may be a factor. This possibility is supported by the concurrent low
BUN, hypocholesterolemia, and dilute urine. As seen with decreased BUN, starvation can

Case Summary and Outcome
The combination of hypoglycemia, low BUN, hypoalbuminemia, and hypocholesterolemia in
the absence of starvation or severe malnutrition suggests decreased liver function. PT and
APTT were not evaluated, but may have been prolonged in this case because of diminished
production of coagulation factors by the liver. Elevations in ALP and ALT also support hepatic

It was concluded that the isosthenuria was likely related to liver disease. Polyuria and

urine specific gravity in this patient. Abnormal neurotransmitters overstimulate the pituitary.

for ADH release is increased so higher plasma osmolality is required to stimulated anti-

significant dehydration is not common. Reduced urea formation in the liver may also
contribute as well.

The clinical interpretation of this value is unclear at this time, however any further decrement in

Marked hypoglycemia: In the context of the clinical history of seizures, this value is likely
accurate, however verification to rule out laboratory error is always appropriate. Because the

animals on an all milk diet (Adams).
Hyperbilirubinemia: Hemolysis, liver disease, and sepsis are all possible contributors to this
abnormality. The patient has clinical signs or laboratory abnormalities that could be compatible
with all three causes, so a single precipitating factor cannot be identified at this time.
Elevated serum GGT: In adult ruminants and camelids, increased serum GGT is an indicator
of hepatic pathology. In some species serum GGT activity may increase in neonatal animals
because colostrum contains large amounts of GGT, which is absorbed through the neonatal
gut. In calves and lambs, but not crias, serum GGT has been advocated as an indicator of
passive transfer status (Johnston, Tessman). In this case, the concurrent hyperbilirubinemia

Interpretation
CBC: Maya's leukogram is characterized by a severe leucopenia (Figure 3-4). Too few leukocytes
were present on the blood film for an accurate dlifferential cell count, however a severe
neutropenia is present. A normocytic, normochromic anemia is present. The anemia is more
severe than it appears to be because Maya is significantly dehydrated, and hemoconcentration
 increases the hematocrit. Platelet numbers cannot be evaluated due to clumping.

Serum Biochemical Profile
clinical signs, which could include mental dullness or seizures. In combination with the severe
neutropenia, sepsis is an important differential diagnosis for the hypoglycemia in this patient.
Maya is too young to prioritize neoplasia, and her good body condition makes starvation
unlikely. Inadequate gluconeogenesis secondary to liver failure is possible since no specific
tests of liver function have been performed and Maya is hypoalbuminemic, hyperbiliru-
binemic, has low normal serum cholesterol, and has abnormal bleeding secondary to catheter
placement. Abnormal bleeding may alternatively be explained by diminished platelet
function associated with hypothermia, or disseminated intravascular coag ulation (DIC).
Hypocalcemia: Because of extensive binding of calcium to albumin, low total calcium levels
in the blood may be explained by hypoalbuminemia. Correction formulas have been

developed for the dog, but are not applicable to the cat. Low total calcium caused by
hypoproteinemia is not typically associated with clinical signs of hypocalcemia, however if
there is any question, the biologically active ionized fraction of calcium should be
determined.
Panhypoproteinemia: Low levels of both albumin and globulin proteins indicate plasma loss.
Hemorrhage is a common cause, however Maya has no history of external blood loss. Plasma
may also be lost via exudation or extravasation through compromised gut wall and skin or in
association with parasitism. In Maya's case, increased capillary permeability associated with
endotoxemia or gastrointestinal losses seem most likely. (See Chapter 4 for further discussion
of abnormalities in protein)
Mild hyponatremia: Hyponatremia in dehydrated patients is often attributable to increased
likely to have lost sodium through her compromised gastrointestinal tract, however other
sources of loss include third space, renal, and cutaneous losses.
contribute to the hypokalemia. Decreased intake also may be a factor in anorectic patients.
Like sodium, potassium may be lost into effusions or through the kidney or skin. Transcellular
shifts in patients with acid/base disorders also may influence serum potassium levels, but

Mild hyperbilirubinemia: Increased bilirubin often reflects inadequate uptake of bilirubin by

enzyme levels are not adequate tests of liver function, and serum bile acid determinations
are required for further evaluation of hepatic function. As indicated in the interpretation of
hypoglycemia, the low albumin and cholesterol could be compatible with decreased liver
function, however the predominance of clinical and laboratory data suggest endotoxemia as
the cause for the hyperbilirubinemia. Endotoxin decreases hepatocellular uptake of bilirubin,
and may cause mild to moderate hyperbilirubinemia.
Case Summary and Outcome
panleukopenia was suspected. A canine parvo test was positive, and she was treated with
Feline panleukopenia is characterized by damage to the intestinal villi, resulting in
malabsorptive diarrhea and increased permeability of the gut wall. Viral replication in
hematopoietic tissues causes leukopenia, which is often profound and parallels the severity of
clinical disease. The combination of intestinal compromise and leukopenia leads to secondary
bacteremia and endotoxemia and is rapidly fatal. Disseminated intravascular coagulation may
occur secondary to sepsis, although cats are less likely to have clinically detectable abnormal
bleeding than dogs with similar laboratory parameters. Blood clotting is also impaired when
not resolved because coagulation testing was not performed in this patient.

Both Freeze (Chapter 3, Case 8) and Maya have histories of febrile illness, hypoglycemia, and
hyperbilirubinemia, although Maya's clinical presentation and laboratory data more clearly
indicate sepsis. In contrast, Freeze appeared to have had a less severe illness with resultant
better outcome. Both sepsis and liver disease can cause hyperbilirubinemia. Both may occur
simultaneously in the patient, in which case it may not be possible to determine which is the
major contributor to the increased bilirubin levels in the blood. See Chapter 2 Case 9 (dog),
Chapter 2 Case 14 (llama), and Chapter 2 Case 21 (dog).

inflammation. There is a mild normocytic normochromic, apparently nonregenerative, anemia,
compatible with chronic disease or hypothyroidism. Mild hemoconcentration may mask a
slightly lower PCV.
Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperproteinemia with hyperalbuminemia: Hyperalbuminemia is not the result of
overproduction by the liver, but cdoes reflect hemoconcentration. Bursely's owners report that he
is crinking less water than is usual and dehydration is noted on the physical examination, which
support hemoconcentration as the cause for the increased albumin and hyperproteinemia.

history and laboratory data. Bursley has not eaten recently and is not taking medications,
ruling out these as likely contributors to this abnormality. Pancreatitis or liver disease are less
likely based on Bursley's history (no vomiting, diarrhea, or icterus) and normal serum activites
of liver and pancreatic enzymes. Endocrinopathies can be associated with hypercholes-
terolemia, specifically diabetes mellitus, hyperadrenocorticism, and hypothyroidlism. The
absence of hyperglycemia or glucosuria makes diabetes unlikely. The alopecia might support
hyperadrenocorticism, however 95% of dogs with this condition have increased ALP, which is
not present here. Based on the clinical presentation and laboratory data, hypothyroidism
seems probable, although further testing is required to confirm this diagnosis.
Case Summary and Outcome
Thyroid test results for Bursley included a low basal T4 (<1.0 μg/dl, reference interval 1.0-
4.4), and decreased free T4 (0.44 ng/dl, reference inverval 0.8-2.0). Thyroid stimulating
hormone (TSH) levels were low, suggesting secondary hypothyroidism. A CT scan showed a
therapy and symptomatic therapy including thyroid hormone supplementation, however the
owner elected euthanasia due to the poor prognosis and economic constraints. At necropsy,
a 2.2 cm soft, pale yellow mass replaced the pituitary gland and expanded into the
hypothalamus. Histologically, the mass was identified as a pituitary chromophobe adenoma.
Secondary hypothyroidism is uncommon, and accounts for less than 5% of clinical cases of
hypothyroid dogs, however it is not present in all cases. Decreased serum erythropoietin
levels, diminished oxygen demand by peripheral tissues, and impaired iron uptake have been
proposed as contributing factors to the anemia. The white blood cell count is variable in
these patients. More than 75% of hypothyroid dogs will have fasting hypercholesterolemia in

observed in this patient. While both cholesterol production and degradation are impaired by
hypothyroidism, degradation is more effected. Thyroid hormone is necessary for the
activation of lipoprotein lipase, for the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors,
and for hepatic uptake of cholesterol from the circulation.

Interpretation
CBC: Salvatore's hematology data includes a mild mature neutrophilic leukocytosis, and a
anemia secondary to chronic disease. If a healthy baseline hematocrit is available for
comparison, it might be possible to determine how significant a deviation this hematocrit is
from the patient's normal hematocrit. Because of the severe thrombocytopenia and clinical
evidence of a coagulopathy, blood loss anemia is likely. Blood loss anemias are generally
regenerative if given sufficient time, so this bleeding may be relatively acute (<3-5 days)
There are marginal signs of regeneration (low MCHC, increased polychromsia and
anisocytosis), however a reticulocyte count is needed to quantitate the response. Increased
numbers of nucleated erythrocytes in the circulation may occur as part of a regenerative
response or may be associated with some type of endothelial damage or lesions in the
hematopoietic organs. Severe thrombocytopenia in a relatively healthy patient with minimal
changes in other hematopoietic lines suggests immune-mediated thrombocytopenia,
although infectious causes such as tick-borne diseases should also be considered.
Serum Biochemical Profile
compatible with stress.
Case Summary and Outcome
Immune-medliated thrombocytopenia was presumptively diagnosed based on the marked
thrombocytopenia and the absence of other causes of decreased platelets. Serologic tests
for tick borne diseases such as Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and Ehrlichial organisms were
negative. Salvatore was treated with immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids. His clinical
condition improved, and subseguent blood samples were collected 14 days after initiation of
therapy.

Day 14: By this time, Salvatore's leukogram is characteristic for a corticosteroid leukogram
and includes a mature neutrophilic leukocytosis, lymphopenia, and monocytosis.
Superimposed inflammation could account for a portion of the neutrophilic leukocytosis and
monocytosis. Salvatore still has mild anemia, however the thrombocytopenia has resolved,
and a rebound thrombocytosis is evident.
Serum Biochemical Profile Day 14
Increased ALP, GGT, and ALT: The majority of the increase in ALP and GGT is likely due to
corticosteroid induction of these enzymes (please see Chapter 2 for complete discussion of
these parameters), although some degree of cholestasis may accompany the vacuolar
hepatopathy associated with corticosteroid effects on the liver. The increased ALT could be
the result of focal hepatocellular necrosis or cholestasis secondary to corticosteroid
treatment. Canine ALT has a longer half life than AST, which may explain the discrepancy
between the values.
teroids causes increased cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the blood.
Salvatore was weaned off of his corticosteroids and recovered well. The serum biochemical
abnormalities resolved after discontinuation of prednisone. Increases in endogenous corticos-
teroids or treatment with pharmacologic doses of corticosteroids may have multiple
metabolic effects that could cause abnormalities in the serum biochemical profile. The
occurrence of both clinical signs and laboratory abnormalities related to corticosteroid
treatment can vary dramatically between individual animals on similar doses of hormone. The

elevations are often present, the degree of increase is not consistent. Treatment with corti-
costeroids can also increase serum bile acids. Additional possible abnormalities associated
with corticosteroids include mild hyperglycemia secondary to insulin resistance. Occasionally

glucosuria may accompany the hyperglycemia if the renal threshold for reabsorption of
glucose is exceeded (about 200 mg/dl for the dog). Less commonly, BUN may be decreased
secondary to glucocorticoid stimulated diuresis; diuresis also decreases urine specific gravity
in some patients. Rarely, serum phosphate may be decreased due to increased losses in the
urine.
Gl Case 12 - Level 2
"Kazoo" is a 7-year-old neutered male yellow Labrador who began vomiting four days ago.
Abdominal radiographs suggested the presence of a foreign body in his stomach, and a
tennis ball was removed via gastrotomy. He was discharged two days after surgery, and
presented this morning groggy and unresponsive. On physical examination, Kazoo is thin,
markedly dehydrated, and hypothermic. His mucous membranes are injected, and he
appears to have fluid in his abdominal cavity.

Interpretation
CBC
Leukogram: The leukogram is characterized by a mature neutrophilic leukocytosis,
monocytosis, and eosinophilia. The neutrophils are toxic, indicating systemic inflammation.
Occasional reactive lymphocytes are compatible with antigenic stimulation. Hypersensitivity

increased eosinophils, in addition to mast cell tumor and lymphoma (both tumors can
stimulate the production and recruitment of eosinophils in some cases). Despite the poor
leukogram are absent. Eosinophilia in extremely stressed or ill patients can be compatible
with hypoadrenocorticism.
Erythrogram: The mild normocytic normochromic anemia is likely nonregenerative and
suggests anemia of chronic disease.
Thrombocytopenia: Both decreased production and increased consumption could contribute
to the decreased platelet counts. The activity of the myeloid lineage argues against a
generalized bone marrow disorder and lack of production, however the nonregenerative
anemia could suggest marrow compromise. Hemorrhage, vascular abnormalities,
disseminated intravascular coagulation (DlC) and immune mediated-destruction all accelerate
platelet destruction. The prolongation of PT and APTT and increase of FDPs support DIC as
the most likely cause for the thrombocytopenia. Primary immune mediated thrombocy-

Serum Biochemical Profile
Hypoglycemia: All samples were processed appropriately, so laboratory error was ruled out.
The clinical information, inflammatory leukogram, and presence of DlC are compatible with
sepsis as a cause for the hypoglycemia. Considering the leukogram data, hypoadrenocor-
ticism may also be a cause for Kazoo's hypoglycemia. Corticosteroids from the adrenal gland
increase hepatic gluconeogenesis and decrease glucose uptake and utilization in peripheral
tissues. Consequently, hypoglycemia may result from inadequate corticosteroid production

of hypoglycemia, hypoalbuminemia, hypocholesterolemia, and prolonged coagulation times
are also compatible with decreased liver function, which should be evaluated by fasted and
post-prandial bile acid testing. The clinical history describes the patient as thin, and he has
probably not had normal food intake for awhile, so nutritional compromise could contribute

Azotemia: Prerenal azotemia is likely because Kazoo is markedly dehydrated. A renal

loss via hemorrhage, cutaneous lesions, the gastrointestinal tract or third space loss.
Significant protein could be lost into the abdominal effusion in this patient, and a poor
nutritional plane and increased protein catabolism after surgery could complicate Kazoo's
protein metabolism. Vigorous fluid resuscitation may exacerbate the hypoproteinemia. As
noted in the section on hypoglycemia, the combination of low glucose, albumin, cholesterol,
to hypoalbuminemia, and may be an issue in this case relative to poor body condition and a
period of anorexia.
Moderately increased AST: Because this enzyme is present in multiple tissues, the
interpretation of increased AST can be unclear. Because the ALT is within the reference
interval, elevated AST is best interpreted here as a potential indlicator of muscle damage.
Muscle damage is likely secondary to the poor perfusion status of this animal. Increased AST
could also be iatrogenic and related to invasive procedures like surgery, however serum AST
levels would be expected to normalize several days after the procedure. Measurement of
creatine kinase (CK) could help confirm muscle origin for AST, but this information is not
critical to the diagnosis for this patient. Because Kazoo has multiple laboratory abnormalities

Hypocholesterolemia: As noted above, decreased liver function should be ruled out as a
is hypoadrenocorticism. Keep in mind that not all Addisonians have the classical electrolyte
abnormalities. In particular, patients with glucocorticoid dependent hypoadrenocorticism
often have hypocholesterolemia (Lifton). The absence of adequate amounts of cortisol in the
circulation may alter cholesterol absorption from the gut, or may depress hepatic production

secondary coagulation involving both the extrinsic and intrinsic or the common pathways.
This abnormality in combination with the moderate thrombocytopenia and the presence of
fibrin degradation products is diagnostic for DiC. Decreased liver function may contribute to
the prolongation of the PT and APTT secondary to diminished production of coagulation
factors and poor liver function can be associated with increased FDPs because of impaired
clearance by the liver. Conversely, DlC can be associated with liver disease secondary to a

Abdominal fluid analysis: Kazoo's abdominal fluid is an exudate characterized by
suppurative inflammation. The recent abdominal surgery may explain some or all of the
inflammation. While there is no direct evidence of a bacterial cause (no organisms are seen
poor clinical condition and DlC. A culture of the fluid is strongly recommended.
Case Summary and Outcome
At the time of presentation, Kazoo's clinical signs were suggestive for sepsis, and thoracic
radiographs were supportive of pneumonia. Kazoo slowly improved on intravenous
antibiotics and fluids, however his progress was slower than expected. Because of the
combination of poor clinical response with persistent eosinophilia, hypocholesterolemia, and
apparent difficulties maintaining adequate blood glucose concentrations, Kazoo was
evaluated for hypoadrenocorticism. An ACTH stimulation test revealed a resting cortisol
value of 0.21 μg/dl (reference interval 2-6) and a post ACTH cortisol level of <0.20 μg/dl
(reference interval 6-18), supporting a diagnosis of hypoadrenocorticism. Kazoo was
discharged on oral antibiotics and oral prednisone with the recommendation that his owners
try to fatten him up. All serum biochemical abnormalities had resolved on re-evaluation of
the patient several weeks after therapy, so work up for potential liver failure was not pursued.
Primary hypoadrenocorticism results from loss of approximately 85-90% of both adrena
cortices. Secondary hypoadrenocorticism due to lesions in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis
resulting in ACTH deficiency is rare. Immune mediated destruction of the adrenal glands is
the suspected cause of hypoadrenocorticism in many patients, although granulomatous
disease, infarction, trauma, metastatic disease, and iatrogenic causes are also possible.
Patients with hypoadrenocorticism often have nonspecific signs such as weakness and give
the impression of severe illness. Vague gastrointestinal signs may be present. Although most
patients with hypoadrenocorticism have insufficiency of all zones of the adrenal cortex,
classical laboratory abnormalities on the serum biochemical profile including hyponatremia,
hypochloremia, and hyperkalemia reflect the mineralocorticoid deficiency. Because these
abnormalities are not consistently present in all patients with hypoadrenocorticism, ACTH
stimulation testing is recommended for the evaluation of patients with suggestive
presentations (Peterson). Kazoo is in the minority of patients in which the destruction of all
mineralocorticoid deficiency. Although hypoadrenocorticism may have an insidious onset with
a waxing and waning presentation, a stressful event may precipitate clinical signs of hypoad-
abrupt onset of clinical signs in this patient. It is probable that signs of mineralocorticoid
deficiency will eventually develop, and Kazoo should be monitored with this in mind.
Like Bursley (Case 10) and Salvatore (Case 11), an endocrinopathy led to abnormalities in
glucose and cholesterol homeostasis, reinforcing the important role of hormones in
modulating metabolism. As we saw with Maya (Case 9) and Freeze (Case 8), any patient with
signs of sepsis should be monitored for hypoglycemia. These patients tend to present with
more severe signs of illness than patients presenting with hypoglycemia associated with
neoplasia (see Cases 4, 5, and 6, Kippy, Ides, and Russel). Depression caused by severe
illness may be indistinct from clinical signs of hypoglycemia in septic patients. Kazoo's
increased glucose utilization that would normally be bridged by hepatic gluconeogenesis. It

Case Summary and Outcome
Cytologic specimens of the pancreas and biopsies of the liver were obtained at the time of
ultrasound examination. Cytology smears (Figure 3-5) were interpreted to be compatible with
epithelial neoplasia, and metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma was identified on liver biopsy
specimens. Despite the presence of tumor in the liver, liver enzyme cata was unremarkable,
as we have seen in Kippy (primary hepatocellular carcinoma-Case 4) and Russell (metastatic

insulinoma-Case 6). A trypsin-like immunoreactivity test (TLl) was performed to support a
diagnosis of primary pancreatic disease, and TLl was found to be elevated (305 μg/L,
reference interval 12-82). Shorty was discharged with a grave prognosis and died at home
several weeks ater.

anisokaryosis are mild.
The laboratory work in this case is compatible with either pancreatitis or pancreatic
neoplasia. Increased serum lipase can occur in dogs with pancreatic or hepatic neoplasia
(Quigley). Unfortunately, serum amylase and lipase are less useful in cats than in dogs or
people for the diagnosis of pancreatic disease, and other hematologic and biochemical
abnormalities are nonspecific (Gerhardt). Some authors have suggested that serum amylase
and lipase are actually of no diagnostic utility for pancreatitis in cats (Simpson, Williams). TLI
has been proposed as a better alternative for the diagnosis of pancreatic disease in the cat,

Interpretation
CBC: The mild lymphopenia is likely secondary to stress/corticosteroid response.
Serum Biochemical Profile
Mild increases in ALP and GGT: Increases in these enzymes suggest some degree of
cholestasis. Since the bilirubin is within the reference interval, cholestasis may be mild. Many
potential causes of increased ALP exist (see Chapter 2), and enzyme induction by some
mechanisms may not increase bilirubin.
Mildly increased ALT and AST: Hepatocellular damage results in increased release of these
enzymes from liver cells.
Mild increase in amylase, marked increase in lipase: Minor elevations in amylase and lipase
these enzymes in the blood, and the Muffy's clinical signs support some type of intestinal
disease. Pancreatitis is a major differential diagnosis in patients with marked elevations of
serum amylase and lipase. Muffy's case is somewhat unusual in that the increase in amylase is
mild, while the lipase levels are dramatically increased. This pattern has been reported in
association with pancreatic and hepatic neoplasia (Quigley).
Case Summary and Outcome
On survey radiographs, Muffy had a diffuse nodular pattern in her lungs and a calcified mass
in her abdomen. On ultrasound, the liver and spleen appeared normal. Multiple mineralized
and some mesenteric nodules consisted of multiple clusters of tightly adherent atypical
epithelial cells consistent with carcinoma, as well as crystalline material compatible with the

Interpretation
CBC: Quasi has a mature neutrophilic leukocytosis and monocytosis characteristic of an
inflammatory leukogram. The increased hemoglobin concentration and MCHC is an artifact
related to the hemolysis and/or lipemia, since erythrocytes do not overproduce hemoglobin
and the hematocrit is within the reference interval.
Serum Biochemical Profile
Mild hypoalbuminemia: Both decreased production by the liver or increased osses can
contribute to low albumin. Albumin is a negative acute phase reactant, which can limit
hepatic production of this protein with inflammation. Marked liver failure is possible in this
patient, however specific tests of liver function such as bile acids are required to further
evaluate this possibility. Decreased production may be secondary to poor nutritional plane,
which is not the case in this patient. Increased losses of albumin must also be considered,
and the most likely site of protein loss for Quasi is into the abdominal effusion. The potential
for renal loss of protein could be evaluated by performing a urinalysis and/or a urine
protein:creatinine ratio. Gastrointestinal losses are more difficult to quantitate.
Mild hyponatremia and hypochloremia: Increased electrolyte losses or dilution secondary to
retention of free water are common causes of electrolyte abnormalites. Sources of loss are
similar to those for protein, and third space loss into the effusion is most likely in this patient.
Gastrointestinal or renal losses are also possible. When inappropriate renal losses of
hypochloremia due to decreased intake is uncommon in domestic animals.
Mildly elevated ALT and AST: Increases in these enzymes indicate some degree of
hepatocellular damage. Because of the close anatomic proximity of the pancreas and liver and
the vascular anatomy, hepatocellular damage in patients with pancreatitis is likely related to
hepatic ischemia or toxins and inflammatory medliators originating in the inflamed pancreas.
The potential for concurrent cholestasis is difficult to evaluate because hemolysis has
invalidated relevent measurements. Primary hepatic pathology cannot be excluded at this time.

pancreatitis, while in other cases it may occur secondary to decreased lipoprotein lipase
activity with pancreatitis. Alternatively, some authors cite lipolysis of intra-abdominal fat by
free pancreatic enzymes as a contributor. Hyperlipidemia also may be the result of eating a
fatty meal, liver disease, idiopathic conditions, or endocrinopathies such as hyperadrenocor-
ticism, hypothyroidism, or diabetes mellitus.

more likely responsible for the icterus, however the potential for decreased red blood cell

regenerative response, but it may take 3-4 days for a regenerative response to become
apparent following acute onset of red cell destruction. In this case there also may be marrow

CBC's with reticulocyte counts should be performed to evaluate a bone marrow response.

hepatocellular damage, however AsT is less tissue specific and muscle damage as well as
hemolysis can increase this value. Elevations in these hepatocellular enzymes are of a
relatively smaller magnitude than those in the cholestatic enzymes, which could suggest
hepatocellular damage secondary to cholestasis or secondary to pancreatic disease (see
amylase and lipase). Please note that none of these enzymes are considered indicators of
liver function. Poor perfusion or hypoxia of hepatocytes secondary to anemia can injure
hepatocytes, resulting in increased leakage of enzymes into the circulation.
Mild hyperamylasemia with hyperlipasemia: Both of these enzymes are considered to be
markers of pancreatic damage, however they are not produced exclusively by that organ,
and hyperlipasemia are sometimes noted in patients with intestinal or liver disease. While

and laboratory abnormalities are used to substantiate the diagnosis of pancreatis. While a
variety of other tests are undergoing evaluation for improving the ability to diagnose
pancreatitis (see Jimbo, Case 22), at this point no single ideal test exists.
Case Summary and Outcome
After evaluation of initial clinical laboratory data, abdominal ultrasound was performed. The
liver was markedly enlarged and diffusely hypoechoic, and the bile duct was distended.
Tests of the Gasttointestinal System and Catbohydate Metabolism 117
Tortuous, distended tubular structures interpreted to be biliary ducts were seen throughout
the parenchyma. The ultrasound impression of the pancreas was compatible with chronic
pancreatitis and fibrosis. At surgery, the gall bladder was enlarged and contained sludged
bile. A cholecystoduodenostomy was performed and the patient improved after the
procedure with improvement of bile flow. Biopsy samples of the liver and pancreas collected
at surgery showed moderate chronic cholangiohepatitis and steroid hepatopathy with
moderate chronic lymphoplasmacytic and neutrophilic pancreatitis.
Serial serum biochemical profiles were collected during the period of hospitalization for
supportive care after surgery.

may be indicated.

ALT and AST: Both are following the trends observed in the cholestatic indicators. Because
the hepatocellular damage in this patient was suspected to be occurring secondary to
cholestasis, decrements in these values are expected with relief of the cholestatic process
Increases in serum ALT occur within 12 hours of liver damage, generally peak by day 5 after
an acute insult, and then fall over the next one or two weeks. In acute liver disease, a 50%
decrease in serum ALT levels over 24-48 hours is considered a positive prognostic indicator.
Although serum ALT has a longer half life than serum AST in dogs (2.5 days vs. 5-12 hours),
Nutmeg's ALT is falling faster than the AST. This may be because extrahepatic tissue damage
is contributing to the serum AST activity or because there is ongoing, low level release from
hepatocytes. AST can be a more sensitive, albeit less specific, indicator of hepatocellular
damage.
Hypoalbuminemia with no change in globulin: Considerations for hypoalbuminia with
normal globulin generally include loss, impaired liver function, and starvation. Impaired liver

physiologically limited because albumin is a negative acute phase reactant. Renal loss of
albumin is not supported by the urinalysis data, although the urine is dilute and a urinary
protein:creatinine ratio could be performed as a more sensitive test for glomerular loss of
protein. Patients should be evaluated for clinical evidence of loss into the third space,
gastrointestinal tract or via cutaneous lesions. Acute anorexia alone is not sufficient to cause
hypoalbuminemia, although because albumin is a protein reservoir for the body, anorexia
combined with surgery, fever, acidosis, or other causes of increased demands on the protein
pool could lower albumin.
possibly secondary to upregulation of cholesterol synthesis and decreased biliary excretion of
cholesterol. Endocrinopathies such as hyperadrenocorticism, hypothyroidism, and diabetes
mellitus can increase serum cholesterol as well.
Hypomagnesemia: Disorders of magnesium are less well characterized than for most other

translocation. Magnesium is a critical ion for the function of numerous enzyme systems and
influences calcium metabolism, therefore correction of hypomagnesemia is usually
recommended.
does not necessarily signify renal disease. In the absence of azotemia or clinical evidence of
dehydration, isothenuria in Nutmeg may not be abnormal or may be in response to fluid
with medullary washout, decreased metabolism of diuretic hormones such as cortisol, and
excess bilirubin in the blood. Mild bilirubinuria may occur in normal dogs because of
elimination. In this case, the 2+ bilirubin in relatively dilute urine combined with the hyper-
bilirubinemia and elevated liver enzymes is compatible with hepatic disease.

bile duct with subsequent cholestasis and secondary hepatocellular camage. In contrast,
Quasi's (Case 15) liver enzyme elevations were of a more modest degree and there was no
histologic evidence of hepatic pathology; the liver enzyme elevations may have been related to
induction by anticonvulsant therapy. Quasi had much more significant lipid changes compared
to Nutmeg despite the likely absence of significant liver dlisease. This may be due to a more
acute severe pancreatitis compared to Nutmeg, who seemed to have a rather low grade
pancreatic inflammation not associated with effusion or significant peripancreatic steatitis. In
many cases, it can be difficult to be sure of the exact pathophysiologic relationships and
causative factors in patients with multiple inter-related condlitions. In Nutmeg's case, ultrasound
findings were supportive of a lesion amenable to surgical correction. Laboratory work alone is
 not typically adequate for this type of medlical decision making.

Interpretation
CBC
Leukogram: Flame has a mild leucopenia with lymphopenia. Causes of lymphopenia are
numerous, but some possibilities in this case include acute viral disease, endotoxemia,
rickettsial diseases and corticosteroid effects. Neutrophil numbers are approaching the lower
end of the reference interval and should be monitored. Endotoxemia and rickettsial diseases
may suppress neutrophil numbers and cause toxic change, while corticosteroids should result
in mild mature neutrophilia with no morphologic abnormalities. The fibrinogen is not
supportive of inflammation. The remainder of the CBC was unremarkable.
Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: Elevations in serum glucose in the horse are most often caused by
excitement or stress with release of endogenous catecholamines and glucocorticoids,
respectively. In this case, this may be the result of pain from episodes of colic, described in
the patient's history. A corticosteroid effect is supported by the concurrent lymphopenia.
Transient hyperglycemia can also be observed in the very acute phase of endotoxemia prior
to hypoglycemia. In an older horse like Flame, insulin resistance associated with hyperplasia
or tumor of the pituitary pars intermedia (Equine Cushing's syndrome) can cause
hyperglycemia. Insulin-responsive diabetes mellitus is rare in domestic arge animal species.
Hypocalcemia: Because a significant fraction of calcium in the blood is complexed to protein,
low serum albumin can result in low total serum calcium measurements. In this case, the
albumin is low, but not outside of the reference range. Total hypocalcemia associated with
hypoalbuminemia does not affect the biologically active ionized fraction, and so is not
associated with clinical signs. A recent study of 64 horses with enterocolitis showed that 75%
had low total serum calcium and 80% had low ionized calcium (Toribio). The mechanism was
unclear, but did not appear to be due to renal wasting as fractional excretion of calcium was
significantly lower in horses with colitis than healthy control horses. Serum intact parathyroid
concentrations (PTH) were normal to increased, suggesting a variable physiological response
to hypocalcemia. Studies in humans and laboratory animals indicate that sepsis and
inflammatory hormones can influence hormonal regulation of calcium by calcitonin and PTH.
In turn, hypomagnesemia can interfere with PTH secretion and alter the responsiveness of
target tissues to PTH stimulation. Primary hypoparathyroidism could cause hypocalcemia, but
is rare in horses. More likely, anorexia may also contribute to hypocalcemia in horses.
Hypomagnesemia:
Hypomagnesemia could be due to dietary deficiency, impaired gut absorption or increased
renal excretion. Because of the role of magnesium in calcium regulation, correction of low
serum magnesium levels may be sufficient to correct hypocalcemia.

attributable to increased gastrointestinal losses associated with colic, although significant
losses from sweating are also likely. When changes in serum chloride are proportional to 
sodium, no further analysis is required. When the relative decrease in chloride appears to be
greater than sodium, considerations include pure gastric vomiting (not seen in horses),
change in response to a primary respiratory acidosis. Because bicarbonate and chloride are
alkalemia. In this case the HCO3 is within the reference interval despite the hypochloremia,
consistent with a mixed acid/base disorder. Increased anion gap is most often associated with
elevations in unmeasured anions, many of which are acids.
Increased GGT: In an adult horse, increased GGT is evidence for liver damage and
efficiently eliminated in the urine. ALP is less liver specific than GGT and may be less
sensitive in the horse.
Increased AST: This enzyme is present in multiple tissues and elevations can be difficult to
interpret. In Flame, the concurrent increase in GGT and the normal CK supports hepatic
rather than muscle origin for the increase in AST, although the shorter half life of CK could
influenceinterpretation.
Hypertriglyceridemia: Fasted horses with hypertriglyceridemia should be evaluated for
hyperlipemia/hyperlipidemia syndrome, which is often triggered by feed restriction or
anorexia during colic episodes (Mogg). The syndrome is caused by decreased feed intake
with subsequent fat mobilization and accumulation in the plasma and liver. Flame is more
triglyceride concentration. Hyperlipemia is a more serious condlition accompanied by
lactescent plasma, impaired hepatic function and the production of abnormal very low
density lipoproteins that have less apolipoprotein B-100 and more apolipoprotein B-48. This
substitution may allow greater triglyceride content (Pearson). Although the triglyceride levels
in this patient exceeded the 1,200 mg/dl associated with a poor prognosis in the paper
originally describing this condition (Mogg), absence of any clinical or laboratory evidence of
significant liver cysfunction associated with the hyperlipidemia improves the prognosis.
Case Summary and Outcome
Flame was extremely painful on her right front limb and was very sensitive to pressure from
hoof testers. Relief of pain with an abaxial nerve block resulted in improved appetite, which
corrected the hyperlipidemia. Flame responded well to intravenous fluids and calcium
gluconate to correct the mineral and electrolyte imbalances from the colic. The neurologic
abnormalities noted on the history were not confirmed at presentation. Had they been

Interpretation
CBC: Marion has a mature neutrophilic leukocytosis with toxic change, leukopenia, and a
monocytosis. The toxic changes in the neutrophils are consistent with inflammation, although
the other elements of the leukogram are also compatible with a corticosteroid response. The
mild normocytic normochromic nonregenerative anemia is most compatible with anemia of
chronic disease.
Serum Biochemical Profile
Marked hyperglycemia: The magnitude of the hyperglycemia in combination with glucosuria
hyperglycemia should be ruled out. This patient has hypercholesterolemia and increased
triglycerides in addition to marked hyperglycemia. While post-prandial elevations are
possible, this degree of hyperglycemia would be unusual even if blood were collected just
after eating. Marion had been fasted over night when this sample was collected. Ilness of
any kind may cause mild elevations in glucose by interfering with insulin action on peripheral
tissues. Increases in both endogenous and exogenous corticosteroids may cause significant
increases in serum glucose concentrations. This patient had not been treated with corticos-
teroids within the previous six months, however elevations of endogenous corticosteroid
levels cannot be ruled out at this time. Hyperadrenocorticism may cause polyuria and
polydipsia, hyperglycemia, and increases in ALP, cholesterol, and triglycerides.
Hyperadrenocorticism and diabetes mellitus can be present concurrently, complicating both
the interpretation of laboratory tests and the clinical management of the patient.
Hyponatremia and hypochloremia: In many cases, hyponatremia reflects a relative water
excess rather than total bocy depletion of sodium. In patients like Marion that have marked
hyperglycemia, the increase in free water is due to the osmotic force generated by the
excess glucose in the extracellular fluid. Serum sodium typically decreases by 1.5 mEq/L for
each 100 mg/dl increase in glucose concentration above the upper end of the reference
interval. Therefore in this case, we would expect serum sodium to decrease by approximately
7.5 mEq/l, which seems an appropriate degree in this case. Changes in sodium are often
accompanied by proportional alterations in chloride, as seen in this case. (Please see Chapter
7 for further cliscussion).
124 Manual of Veterinary Clinical Chemisty: A Case Study Approach
Hyperkalemia: The regulation of potassium balance is complex and involves total body
regulation as well as shifts between intracellular and extracellular compartments. For Marion,
the mild hyperkalemia is likely due to insulin deficiency. Insulin causes potassium to enter
cells, and inadequate amounts of insulin will impair this process. Acidosis may further
increase potassium levels in some diabetic patients, however the bicarbonate levels in this
patient are within the reference interval. (Please see Chapter 7 for further discussion). Failure
of renal elimination can be important, but this is unlikely to be a major mechanism in this
fluids can be an issue.
Mildly increased ALP and ALT: There are many potential causes for increased ALP in the

glucose homeostasis that are present in diabetes mellitus, lipid accumulates within the
hepatocytes. This can lead to mild cholestasis and increased ALP. Similarly, hepatocellular
enzymes may also increase with diabetes mellitus. While hepatocellular pathologic changes
are usually mild, occasional diabetics will also have increased bile acids, suggesting
decreasedliver function.
Hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia: In poorly controlled insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus, there is a rapid mobilization of triglycerides, which increases plasma levels of

insulin leads to decreased activation of lipoprotein lipase, so fatty acids cannot be taken up
from the circulation for storage in adipose tissue. In addlition, down regulation of low density
lipoprotein receptors in the absence of insulin results in hypercholesterolemia. Post-prandial
hyperlipidemia, pancreatic or liver disease, and other endocrinopathies such as hyperadreno-
corticism or hypothyroidism may also cause abnormalities of cholesterol and triglycerides.

the urine specific gravity slightly (an increase in specific gravity of 0.001 per 400 mg 
protein/dl or per 270 mg glucose/dl). Proteinuria is present, and may be the result of urinary
tract infection, as indicated by the active sediment and presence of bacteria. It should be
noted that not all diabetic patients with urinary tract infection will have active sediment,
possibly due to neutrophil function defects that have been described in these patients.
Proteinuria may also occur as a result of glomerular damage secondary to diabetes or the

Once diagnosed, a variety of approaches for home monitoring of blood glucose and

Amaryllis is a 7-year-old spayed female Doberman Pinscher mixed breed dog presenting for a
20 pound weight loss over the past year attributed to decreased consumption of table food.
Over the past month, Amaryllis has been lethargic and anorexic, associated with intermittent
vomiting and diarrhea. Her previous history includes an asymptomatic heart murmur. On
physical examination, Amaryllis was thin and depressed but alert and responsive. The
presence of a left-sided systolic heart murmur was confirmed. She had a tight, distended
abdomen, but she was not painful on abdominal palpation. Abdominal ultrasound showed an
enlarged hyperechoic liver, changes in the region of the pancreas compatible with pancreatitis,
and mild abdominal effusion. Thoracic radiographs were suggestive of pneumonia.

Leukogram: Amaryllis has a barely perceptible neutrophilia, which in combination with the
toxic change supports mild inflammation. Potential sources include pneumonia, pancreatitis,

with endogeneous corticosteroids from a protracted illness.

evaluation, post-prandial effects or the possibility of either transient corticosteroid or
epinephrine induced elevations should be ruled out. Given the history of weight loss and the
presence of significant amounts of glucose and ketones in the urine, diabetes mellitus should
be considered a primary differential diagnosis. Whenever blood glucose levels exceed
approximately 200 mg/dl, the renal tubular maximum for glucose reabsorption can be

fructosamine levels could be considered, but is probably not necessary for Amaryllis. Any
cause of insulin resistance such as hyperadrenocorticism must also be considered. Amaryllis
has a mild neutrophilic leukocytosis and lymphopenia, compatible with a corticosteroid
effect. Pancreatitis can be associated with hyperglycemia, either due to stress secondary to
pain or due diabetes mellitus. Pancreatitis-induced diabetes may be transient or permanent,
depending on the severity of pancreatic damage.
Mild hypophosphatemia and hypocalcemia: Neither of these values is likely to be physio-
logically significant. The hypocalcemia may be related to the low serum albumin and is
unlikely to be associated with a decrease in biologically active ionized calcium. Hypocalcemia
has been described in dogs with acute pancreatitis, but it does not appear to be as common
as in humans (Hess 1998). Both total and ionized calcium levels may be low in cats with acute

occur if the phosphorus drops below 1 mg/dl. Treatment of diabetic patients with insulin can
promote a rapid translocation of phosphorus into cells, associated with a precipitous and
potentially dangerous decline in serum phosphorus. Acidemia is associated with a cellular
translocation from the intracellular to the extracellular space, therefore correction of
acid/base disturbances in ketotic patients can further depress the serum phophorus
concentration.
Hypoproteinemia with hypoalbuminemia and low normal globulins: Considerations for
hypoalbuminemia include decreased production secondary to starvation, liver failure, or a
negative acute phase response. The weight loss in this patient is dramatic, and starvation
typically lower serum albumin. Liver enzyme elevations are compatible with liver disease,
however other analytes that may decrease with impaired liver function (blood urea nitrogen,
glucose, and cholesterol) are normal to increased. None of these values are sensitive or

are at risk for urinary tract infections, the possibility that proteinuria is due to lower urinary
tract disease should be ruled out prior to pursuing a diagnosis of glomerular disease.
Hypokalemia: Anorexia can contribute to hypokalemia because of decreased intake of
potassium, however it is usually only clinically significant in combination with increased losses.
Amaryllis could be losing potassium through her gastrointestinal tract since there is a history
of vomiting and diarrhea, or she may be losing it into the abdominal effusion. Renal
potassium wastage is associated with osmotic diuresis from glucosuria and ketonuria. While

cells, some authors conclude that these shifts are transient and less significant with organic
acidosis like ketoacidosis than for mineral acidosis. Although serum potassium levels are not
good indicators of total body potassium stores, the history of polyuria and gastrointestinal
signs in this patient puts her at risk for potassium depletion. As discussed above in regards to
phosphorus, treatment with insulin is expected to cause translocation of potassium into cells
that could further depress serum potassium.

unlikely. Serum ALP activity can increase with a variety of endocrinopathies, including
diabetes mellitus, however the concurrent hyperbilirubinemia and increased GGT suggests

bilirubinemia and elevated liver enzymes. This syndrome may occasionally mimic a cholestatic
process (Meyer). Because of the steroid leukogram and history of chronic illness,
corticosteroid effects on the liver could also contribute to increases in ALP and GGT, as well
as AST and ALT (see below)
Increased AST with normal ALT: ALT is more specific for hepatocellular damage than AST,
however AST is more sensitive. Many tissues contain AST, limiting the usefulness of this test
for the diagnosis of liver disease, however some degree of hepatocellular damage secondary
to the toxic effects of bile in cholestatic conditions is common. A normal creatine kinase
could help rule out muscle as a source for elevated serum AST. As discussed for Quasi (Case
 15-pancreatitis) and Nutmeg (Case 16-pancreatitis and hepatitis), extension of the
inflammatory process from the pancreas to the liver can cause hepatocellular enzyme
elevations in patients with pancreatitis.
Hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia: Once post-prandial effects are ruled out,
endocrinopathies (hypothyroidism, hyperadrenocorticism, diabetes melitus) and liver or

of pancreatitis. In some cases, multiple causes of hyperlipidemia can be present. For example,
had acute pancreatitis, and 4% were hypothyroid (Hess 2000). Idiopathic hyperlipidemias are
described but much less common than secondary causes. Lipoprotein lipase is an enzyme
monoglycerides. Insulin enhances this function, therefore insulin deficiency leads to
accumulation of triglycerides in the circulation. Insulin deficiency also leads to enhanced
lipolysis, with resultant release of free fatty acids into the circulation which will eventually be
processed by the liver into more triglycerides and ketone bodies (Kerl). Typically, ketone

be helpful to support a diagnosis of pancreatitis. (See Jimbo-Case 22, Quasi-Case 15).
Urinalysis: The specific gravity may be appropriate depending on the hydration status of the
patient since there is no evidence of azotemia. Some amount of osmotic diuresis is expected
ketones Amaryllis is generating are being utilized or eliminated in the urine rather than
accumulating in the blood since she has a normal HCO3, serum chloride, and anion gap.
Urine collected by cystocentesis may have a variable amount of blood contamination, which
could introduce small amounts of protein, heme, red blood cells, and white blood cells.
Although no bacteria are noted, urine culture is still recommended in diabetic patients with
clinical signs compatible with urinary tract infection because of the increased incidence of
occult infections (McGuire).
130 Mamual of Veterinary Clinical Chemisty: A Case Sudy Approach
Case Summary and Outcome
Based on the laboratory work, Amaryllis was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus with ketosis
and imaging studies. She was treated with intravenous fluids, antibiotics and regular insulin.
Over several days, Amaryllis was offered small amounts of bland food and water, but her
abdominal ultrasound. Amaryllis was discharged on fluids and insulin with home-monitoring
of urine for glucose and ketones. Changes in the liver parameters were interpreted to be
secondary to diabetes and pancreatitis, so no liver biopsy was performed.
As alluded to above, there are complex relationships between multiple endocrinopathies,
liver disease, pancreatic disease, and hyperlipidemia. The presence of one of the
abnormalities certainly does not rule out the presence of another, and in fact, they may occur
and insulin resistance resembling or exacerbating diabetes mellitus. Acute necrotizing
pancreatitis can destroy beta cell islets, causing transient or permanent diabetes mellitus.
Conversely, hyperlipidemia may be a predisposing factor for pancreatitis. It may be necessary
to prioritize for treatment the most severe problems based on clinical history and laboratory
abnormalities (in this case diabetes with ketosis). After these are under control, re-assess the
patient to determine if secondary problems resolved with initial treatment or if there are
multiple primary problems. Sometimes, this can be a prolonged process. For example, it is
necessary to control diabetes mellitus to accurately test for hyperadrenocorticism, however
hyperadrenocorticism causes insulin resistance and intereferes with treatment for diabetes.
It is useful to compare Amaryllis with Marion (Case 7) who had diabetes without confirmed
although Amaryllis has hyperbilirubinemia, making it more likely that her liver enzyme
occurring secondary to the diabetes or corticosteroid effects. Quasi (Case 15), the dog with
pancreatitis, also had hepatocellular enzyme elevations, however measurement of cholestatic
enzymes and bilirubin was not possible due to interference secondary to hemolysis. The dog
with histologically confirmed pancreatitis and cholangiohepatitis (Nutmeg-Case 16) had
elevations in all liver enzymes and hyperbilirubinemia of a degree similar to Amaryllis. Like
Nutmeg, it is possible that once the pancreatitis begins to resolve, secondary cholestasis
would be relieved and liver enzyme abnormalities and hyperbilirubinemia would improve in
subsequent biochemical panels in Amaryllis.

mellitus 2 years ago, and is currently taking glipizide. No bloodwork has been performed for
one year. She occasionally gets urinary tract infections, which are characterized by frequent
urinations and usually resolve with antibiotic therapy. On physical examination, Hooligan is
dehydrated with increased skin turgor and tacky mucous membranes. She has moderate
dental tartar and hepatomegaly.

Azotemia:
Azotemia should be categorized as pre-renal, renal, or post-renal. There is no clinical
evidence of urinary obstruction in this patient, therefore prerenal and renal components
is likely pre-renal. Given the degree of dehydration, the urine is less than optimally
concentrated and suggests some renal impairment. It can be difficult to adequately gauge
degree of osmotic diuresis, decreasing urine specific gravity. At the same time, the presence
of glucose in the urine will increase the specific gravity by approximately 0.001 for every 270
mg/dl of glucose.

Decreased HCO3:The decreased HCO3 incdicates acidosis.In this case,actic acidosis due to

Hooligan is certainly at risk for developing ketoacidosis because of anorexia and concurrent
disease (possible urinary tract infection, likely renal failure).
Mild increases in ALT and AST: As noted in Chapter 2 on liver enzymes, there are numerous
extrahepatic processes that can elevate serum liver enzymes in the absence ot primary
hepatic pathology. Several endocrinopathies, including diabetes mellitus, may cause these
abnormalities in the cat. Significant liver disease is less likely in this cat, because most causes
of primary hepatic disease in cats are characterized by hyperbilirubinemia in addition to
diabetes mellitus in this patient in no way rules out hyperthyroidism.

complicate interpretation of diagnostic tests. In some cases, the correct interpretation of
some laboratory data can only be certain after treatment has begun. For example, the
degree of renal versus prerenal azotemia cannot be determined until the patient is
appropriately hydrated. Furthermore, the true renal concentrating ability may not be clear
until glucosuria and the resultant osmotic diuresis is corrected. Although the previous two
cases of diabetes mellitus were not azotemic (Marion-Case 18 and Amaryllis-Case 19),
patients with diabetes mellitus can present with prerenal azotemia and impaired urinary
concentrating ability due to osmotic diuresis in the absence of irreversible renal failure.
As noted above, primary liver dlisease is less likely to be the cause of liver enzyme elevations
liver biopsy are not recommended until other extrahepatic causes of liver enzyme elevations
are assessed. Evaluation of the patient for hyperthyroidism is indicated. Similarly, while
pancreatic disease cannot be ruled out as a cause for clinical signs or a possible contributing
factor to the liver enzyme elevations, amylase is a poor test for pancreatitis in the cat. A
trypsin-like immunoreactivity (TLl) test could be done if pancreatitis remains a concern, but
results need to be interpreted with caution in a patient with renal disease or dehydration as
the results of this test may also be affected by a low glomerular filtration rate. Serum
pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (cPLl) may also be useful in the diagnosis of feline
pancreatitis (Forman).

Interpretation
CBC
Leukogram: Kabob has an inflammatory leukogram with marked neutrophilic leukocytosis
with a left shift, monocytosis and toxic change in the neutrophils.
Erythrogram: Kabob has a normocytic, normochromic anemia. This anemia appears nonre-
 generative, and there is inadequate response by the bone marrow. Chronic disease or
inflammation usually produces a mild non-regenerative anemia as a result of suppression of
red blood cell production. In this case, it may not completely explain an anemia of this
severity. The red blood cell breakdown products in the bone marrow could suggest increased
destruction or apoptosis of red blood cell precursors in the marrow, which may be immune-
mediated and non-specifically related to the underlying illness. There is no evidence of a
neoplastic process in the bone marrow that could suppress erythropoiesis.
Platelets: Because of the megakaryocytic hyperplasia in the marrow, the thrombocytopenia is
interpreted to be due to increased peripheral consumption rather than impaired production
Hemorrhage can cause thrombocytopenia and should be considered with anemia and panhy-
generally mild to moderate. The owners should be questioned carefully to determine if there

neoplasia, however none has been found at this time. Prolonged coagulation times and

development of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Vaccination can be associated with a
mild to moderate but transient thrombocytopenia, as can viral infections. A careful history
should be taken on all thrombocytopenic patients to rule out exposure to drugs or toxins.
Serum Biochemical Profile
Hypoglycemia: Any single low blood glucose measurement should be confirmed with a
repeat sample because of the possibility of in vitro consumption of glucose by cells in unspun
samples. This is especially important in samples with high leukocyte counts as observed in
this patient. CBC data are compatible with a severe inflammatory process, and low blood
glucose levels may be observed in septic patients. Failure of hepatic gluconeogenesis and
concurrent hypoalbuminemia, low BUN, hyperbilirubinemia and prolonged coagulation times.
cause for hypoglycemia is neoplasia. Insulinoma (See Russell-Case 6) and large intra-cavitary
masses that produce abnormal insulin-like growth factors (See Kippy-Case 5) can stimulate

of neoplasia and should be considered if liver function tests are normal, although they are
indicated as part of further work-up of the liver disease regardless. Both hypoalbuminemia
and hypoglycemia can be explained by prolonged starvation, however this is unusual and
Low BUN and Creatinine: Overhydration can dilute blood urea nitrogen, and polyuria will
with polyuria. It is difficult in this case to assess hydration status using laboratory data
because the disease processes are likely to have confounding effects on hematocrit and tota
protein. Despite the dilute urine, the tacky mucous membranes imply dehydration,
suggesting that overhydration is unlikely. Further information about any previous fluid
therapy would be helpful. Significantly decreased liver function will impair production of
BUN. Significant decrease in muscle mass is the major differential diagnosis for decreased
creatinine in the absence of retention of free water. As noted above in the discussion of
starvation in relation to hypoalbuminemia and hypoglycemia, the poor body condition should
be clinically obvious at the point that laboratory abnormalities can be attributed to
nitrogen.
Hypocalcemia: The hypocalcemia is associated with persistently low serum albumin,
therefore it is unlikely that there is truly a low ionized calcium. If there were concurrent
calcium measurement would be recommended.
Minimal hypomagnesemia: This abnormality is commonly noted in critically ill patients and in
this case may be attributable to either decreased intake or increased renal losses. Because
calcium regulation and many other biochemical processes require magnesium as a critica

albumin is a negative acute phase reactant. The negative urinary protein data should be
interpreted in the context of the low specific gravity and may not rule out renal protein loss.
A urinary protein:creatinine ratio is a more accurate way to assess proteinuria in these cases.
At this point, decreased liver function appears to be the most likely cause for low serum

anorexia and poor dietary intake of potassium. Physiologically significant hypokalemia is most

levels, hemolytic anemias are typically regenerative and are coupled with red blood cell
morphologic changes. The inflammatory leukogram and hypoglycemia could be associated
with sepsis, which can impair hepatocellular uptake of bile. The elevated ALP and GGT
suggest cholestasis. The potential for decreased liver function has been discussed above, and
further testing is required to evaluate this component.
Elevated ALP and GGT: Although extrahepatic causes of enzyme elevation can be
a cholestatic process. Although not technically out of range, the cholesterol values seem
somewhat low for a patient with cholestatic liver disease; this may be another sign of
decreased liver function.
Elevated ALT and AST: Elevations in these enzymes support hepatocellular camage. Because

and erythrocytes may be an artifact associated with blood contamination of the sample with
subsequent hemolysis of erythrocytes in the dilute urine. The presence of bacteria indicates
the need for a bacterial culture, especialy with other clinical and laboratory indicators of
inflammation and potential sepsis.
Bone marrow aspirate: Inflammation is resulting in the myeloid hyperplasia. Megakaryocytic
was discussed previously.
Coagulation profile: Prolonged PT and APTT can be explained by markedly impaired liver
function due to low levels of production of coagulation factors. Elevated fibrinogen degradation
thrombocytopenia is not expected to occur with uncomplicated poor liver function and in
combination with the other changes suggest disseminated intravascular coagulation (DlC). A
septic process could trigger DiC. Poor baseline liver function could predispose Kabob to DIC
because of the central role of the liver in the regulation of coagulation.
Case Summary and Outcome
Abdominal ultrasound revealed an enlarged gall bladder with a thickened wall and gal
stones. Kabob was treated with a unit of platelet rich plasma prior to being sent to surgery
on Day 1, where a non-expressible gall bladder and a patent bile duct were observed. A
cholecystectomy for removal of gall stones and liver biopsy were performed. The liver culture
was negative, however the culture of the gall bladder grew alpha Streptococcus and E. coli.
Examination of biopsy samples revealed suppurative cholecystitis and localized suppurative
hepatitis with diffuse extramedullary hematopoiesis. Ascending bacterial infection of the
biliary tree was considered to be the cause of the liver disease. Kabob was treated with
Actigal (ursodeoxycholic acid), intravenous fluids, and antibiotics.

cholestasis may have upregulated Kabob's cholesterol production into the normal reference
range. Despite cecreased liver function, Yap Yap had a normal bilirubin, while Kabob had
hyperbilirubinemia which could be attributed to several other factors in addition to poor
hepatic function. No coagulation studies were peformed on Yap Yap for comparison. Note
that Nutmeg (Case 16) also had liver disease, however there were no indicators of impaired
liver function on the clinical chemistry profile. This does not guarantee normal liver function,
however liver function is not always abnormal even if there is significant hepatic pathology.

inflammation. Although the inflammation cannot be precisely localized based on the available
data, the history and clinical chemistry profile indicates the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and
pancreas are potential sites for initial evaluation.
Erythrogram: Jimbo has a marked macrocytic, hypochromic, likely regenerative anemia with
increased numbers of nucleated erythroid precursors released into the circulation as part of
the regenerative response. A reticulocyte count could be performed to quantify the
response. Heinz bodies indicate oxidative damage to erythrocytes as a cause for the

Spherocytosis is most often associated with immune-mediated damage to erythrocytes,
spherocytes as well.
Plasma: The plasma is markedly hemolyzed. This may occur artifactually or with intravascular
hemolysis. Heinz bodies and spherocytes suggest oxidative damage or immune mediated
causes for intravascular hemolysis in this case. The combination of spherocytes and Heinz

considered. While an ALP may be helpful to evaluate this possibility since most dogs with
hyperadrenocorticism have elevated ALP levels, interpretation may be confounded by
increased ALP secondary to bone growth in a young dog or induction from endogenous
control such as fructosamine or glycated hemoglobin may be necessary to determine if this
patient has diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus is often associated with hypercholesterolemia
 and increased serum triglycerides, which are not noted in this profile.
Increased BUN with normal serum creatinine: A concurrent urinalysis is required for
definitive interpretation of these values and is not available for this case. Nephropathy may
be induced by marked hemoglobinuria in some cases. BUN may also increase prior to
 creatinine in early pre-renal azotemia because of the relatively greater influence of tubular
flow rates on the elimination of urea compared to creatinine. When the BUN is elevated but
the serum creatinine is within reference range, extra-renal factors need to be assessed. High
protein diet, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, fever, and tissue necrosis are other extra-renal
causes of increased BUN that should be ruled out in this case.
Mild hyperphosphatemia with normal calcium: The primary differentials for the mild hyper-
phosphatemia in this case are bone growth in a young dog and/or hemolysis. Bone bone
growth in young large breed dogs may elevate serum phosphorus as will lytic bone lesions,
and the patient should be evaluated for evidence of lameness or bone pain. Serum ALP

hemolysis of the sample. Decreased glomerular filtration rate is a common cause of hyper-
phosphatemia in adult dogs. Typically, the phosphorus will increase as a patient becomes
azotemic, and the high BUN is compatible with decreased glomerular filtration rate.
However, both the increased BUN and elevated phosphorus could result from tissue trauma
or necrosis. Hemolysis itself can increase serum phosphorus because of the high content of
phosphorus in erythrocytes. A similar mechanism involving release ot phosphorus trom
ymphoblasts or myeloblasts has been implicated in the hyperphosphatemia associated with
the tumor lysis syndrome, which would be highly unusual in an eight-month-old and is rarely
observed in adult dogs. Likewise, vitamin D toxicity and primary hypoparathyroidism are less
common causes of hyperphosphatemia and are unlikely in this patient because they are often

Hypoalbuminemia: Low serum albumin can result from either decreased production or
increased losses. Decreased hepatic production of albumin can occur as part of the acute
phase response, which is supported by the inflammatory leukogram. Low albumin production

starvation, which is not compatible with the clinical history. Increased losses of albumin
patient for effusions and edema along with urine protein measurements could assist in ruling
out various sources of loss. Gastrointestinal losses of protein are more difficult to quantify
however measurement of fecal alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor has been suggested as a
potential marker of protein loss into the gut. It is lost into the intestinal lumen with increased
mucosal permeability, however unlike many other proteins, alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor
Mild hypochloremia: Hypochloremia with normal serum sodium concentration suggests
vomiting of gastric contents, consistent with Jimbo's history. Abnormalities of serum chloride
may occur with acid/base abnormalities, however the HCO3 is within reference range in this
profile. In general, the chloride varies inversely with HCO3, however this relationship is not
consistent in mixed acid/base abnormalities. Blood gas analysis is required to fully
this case. Use of diuretics such a furosemide or thiazides can cause wasting, but again is not
present in Jimbo's history.
Mild hypokalemia: Increased gastrointestinal losses and low intake because of anorexia
contribute to this electrolyte abnormality. Diuresis caused by diabetes mellitus can lead to
renal potassium wasting. Hyperglycemia with hyperinsulinemia can cause intracellular
potassium will enter cells in response to alkalemia. Most potassium in the body is
intracellular, and low serum potassium does not always accurately reflect total bocy
potassium status. As with chloride, diuretic use can increase renal potassium loss
hepatocellular damage, however AsT is less tissue specific and muscle damage as well as
hemolysis can increase this value. There are several candidate causes for hepatocellular
damage in Jimbo's case: hypoxia or hypoperfusion of hepatocytes secondary to anemia and

here, given the elevated BUN and phosphorus. Vomiting and dehydration could be a cause

reality is that in clinical patients there is often discordance between them. Some authors
indicate that lipase is a superior test for pancreatitis (Brobst), however some dogs with
of recent studies, various authors have advocated the measurement of canine trypsin-like
immunoreactivity, canine pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (Steiner), and plasma
trypsinogen activation peptide concentration (Mansfield) for the diagnosis of pancreatitis in
dogs with elevated pancreatic enzymes and clinical signs of gastrointestinal disease. None of
these tests appears to have ideal sensitivity and specificity under all conditions, and the
diagnosis of pancreatitis continues to rely on identifying a convincing combination of clinical
signs, laboratory abnormalities, and imaging data.
Coagulation data: Prolonged PT and APTT suggest abnormalities of secondary hemostasis
involving both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways and/or the common pathway. In combination
with evidence of increased fibrinolysis (FDP >20 μg/ml), a mixed hemostatic disorder such as
disseminated intravascular coagulation is possible despite the normal platelet count. Decreased

zinc toxicity was the presumptive cause of death.
Animals may be exposed to zinc in batteries, paints, cosmetics, wood preservatives, zippers,
board game pieces and hardware in addition to pennies minted 1983 or afterward. While
metallic zinc is poorly reactive, solubilization by acid in the stomach leads to absorption and
toxicity. Toxic effects include direct irritation to the gastric mucosa (which may be
exacerbated by the presence of foreign bodies), altered metabolism because of zinc's
interference with other ions such as cadmium, calcium, copper, and iron, and anemia
secondary to impaired erythrocyte production and hemolysis. The exact mechanisms for

absence of a primary immune mediated disease because of non-specific adsorption of
proteins to red blood cell membranes that have been damaged by the zinc, or because of
the presence of zinc on the red blood cell surface.
Zinc may cause hepatocellular and pancreatic damage, leading to elevations in ALP, ALT, AST,
amylase and lipase. Toxic damage could be compounded by poor oxygenation of tissues
associated with severe anemia and inadequate perfusion from dehydration and low cardiac
output resulting from the arrhythmia. Increased BUN and phosphorus, and possible elevated
amylase could result from kidney damage associated with heavy metal intoxication or toxic
effects of hemoglobin. Pre-renal azotemia from dehydration is also a possibility given the
history of vomiting; because the patient is anemic and may have liver disease, the packed
cell volume and albumin do not necessarily reflect hydration status and clinical indicators
must be used. A urine specific gravity is needed to assess urinary concentrating ability, and

Serum Proteins
Review of Proteins
Albumin makes up approximately 35-50% of the total serum protein in most domestic
animals. It is synthesized in the liver and functions as a storage pool of protein and
transporter of amino acids. In addition, albumin acts as a general binding and transport
protein that can prevent loss of constituents via the kidneys. Albumin accounts for
unge pue leus s! li asnag euseid aue o Aoe oouso aut jo s Aateixoidde
Globulin proteins account for the majority of the non-albumin protein measured in the blood.
When separated by electrophoresis, alpha globulins include lipoproteins and some acute
phase reactants. Beta globulins include other acute phase reactants and some
immunoglobulins, while gamma globulins are predominantly immunoglobulins.
Measurement of Serum Proteins
Several methods are available to the clinician for measurement of serum proteins. A common
screening method used in practice is refractometry. This method is based on the refraction of
light as it passes through materials of different densities and it really measures TOTAL
SOLIDS, which includes total protein (which make up most of the total solids), electrolytes,
glucose, urea, and lipids. In health, the total solids are somewhat higher than the total
protein of serum or plasma, but conversion factors in the refractometer account for the
difference under normal circumstances. These corrections may not be accurate in disease
states, and methodologic issues may account for differences between the "total protein"
measured using a refractometer and that measured using an automated chemistry analyzer.
Therefore, we consider refractometry to be an estimate of the total protein.
Automated chemistry analyzers can usually measure total protein and albumin, and then
accomplished by measuring protein-copper complexes, while albumin measurement is
determined by measuring albumin binding of dyes such as bromcresol green (BCG). Binding
affinities vary by type of protein and species of the patient, and so these measurements are

Serum protein electrophoresis separates various classes of proteins by size and charge and is
The cost and time required for serum protein electrophoresis make it less practical for most
purposes, and it is primarily performed to distinguish polyclonal and monoclonal
Interpretation of Serum Protein Data
Like many analytes, protein measurements reflect the sum of production, loss, and dilution or
abnormalities of protein in a clinical patient, factors influencing production, potential sources
of loss, and hydration must all be considered. In some instances, combinations of
abnormalities may result in an albumin or globulin value within the reference interval despite

CBC: No abnormalities are noted.
Serum Biochemical Profile
Low creatinine: The low creatinine reflects Belinda's poor body condition and decreased
muscle mass.
Hypoalbuminemia: Decreased prod uction and increased losses contribute to low serum
albumin levels. Decreased production in this case may be related to nutritional factors given
Belinda's poor body condition. Decreased liver function is possible and may be specifically
evaluated by performing serum bile acid testing; however there are no other serum
biochemical abnormalities that would suggest liver disease. Increased losses should also be
considered with protein loss through the gut as a possible route given Belinda's history of
gastrointestinal issues. No effusions or extensive skin lesions are noted on the physical
examination. A urinalysis should be considered to rule out glomerular loss of albumin since
globulins are within the normal reference interval.
Case Summary and Outcome
Upon further questioning regarding Belinda's history, it was revealed that her owner severely
restricted her food intake based on recommendations made at the time of her hip
o paielan ag oi sieadde eiaungleody 'aseo siyt ul ,'ueal lay daay, oi tuauaoelda
inadequate nutritional plane, and the repeated episodes of dietary indiscretion were due to
Belinda's efforts to get more food. The owner was given a plan to slowly increase Belinda's
food intake to an adequate level. Eventually Belinda achieved a healthy body weight with
improvement in the quality of her coat and resolution of her laboratory abnormalities. The
mext year, when Belinda presented to the hospital for heartworm testing and preventive, she
was overweight, but she appeared happy and had not eaten garbage in over a year.
Hypoalbuminemia in domestic animals on adequate commercial diets is rarely nutritional in
origin. The author has most frequently noted nutritional hypoalbuminemia in cases of animal
neglect or abandonment, although other patients with diseases causing severe or prolonged
increased demand for protein. In starved animals, hypoalbuminemia may be accompanied by
low BUN and/or creatinine, while patients often are able to maintain blood glucose levels if
liver function is adequate. Belinda may be compared with Chapter 5, Case 3 (Marsali), in
which a neglected horse presented with hypoalbuminemia related to nutritional factors. That
horse was also hyperglobulinemic, suggesting that there may have been some
downregulation of albumin production in response to inflammation in addition to starvation.
Chapter 6, Case 16 (Diva) describes a missing cat who lost approximately half her bocy
weight. Despite this extreme nutritional deprivation, Diva's blood glucose and albumin were
within reference intervals at presentation. Her albumin level did drop just slightly below
reference range after correction of her marked dehydration.

Interpretation
CBC: The mild leukocytosis is not likely to be clinically significant because individual types of
leukocytes all fall within reference intervals and there are no morphologic abnormalities that
suggest inflammation or antigenic stimulation. Dylan is not anemic, however his erythrocytes
are microcytic and mildly hypochromic. Microcytosis is most oten associated with either
portosystemic shunts or iron deficiency. A low MCHC may be associated with incomplete
hemoglobinization of reticulocytes or low hemoglobin content because iron is not available
to produce it. The presence of target cells and absence of red cell fragments or
thrombocytosis could be more compatible with liver disease than with iron deficiency.
however these are weak associations and further testing may be necessary to determine the
cause of the microcytosis and hypochromasia.
Serum Biochemical Profile
Hypoglycemia: In patients with no clinical signs of hypoglycemia, artifactual hypoglycemia
due to processing errors should be ruled out by measuring glucose on a freshly collected
sample with prompt separation of serum from cells. After processing error, the most likely
cause for low blood glucose in this case is decreased liver function, possibly related to a
portosystemic shunt. Nutritional factors should not be an issue since Dylan has adequate
body condition. Dylan would be unusually young for paraneoplastic hypoglycemia. Sepsis is
unlikely in a dog presenting with a normal physical examination and CBC parameters.
Hypoproteinemia with hypoalbuminemia: Hypoalbuminemia can be due to decreased
production or increased losses. Because the liver is the site of albumin production, poor liver
function, such as occurs with a portosystemic shunt, can cause hypoalbuminemia. Selective
loss of albumin could occur with glomerular disease and should be considered because the
Urinalysis should detect proteinuria if renal protein loss is occurring, however performing a
urine protein:creatinine ratio may be more sensitive if the urine is dilute. Recall that a normal

Case Summary and Outcome
The concurrent hypoglycemia, hypoalbuminemia, and ammonium biurate stone formation are
compatible with decreased liver function; serum bile acids and imaging studies are indicated
to further evaluate the potential for liver disease. Both fasted and fed serum bile acids were
elevated. At surgery, a single extrahepatic portocaval shunt was identified and an ameroid
presence of a shunt, but also indicated mild mixed inflammation in the periportal areas,
which could contribute to the liver enzyme elevations. Dylan did well in the immediate post-
operative period, but re-presented several days after discharge from the hospital for
weakness, anorexia, and "twitching". He was slightly dehydrated at presentation. His
laboratory work was unremarkable aside from a mild anemia, and his serum bile acids were
within reference intervals. Dylan was treated with fluids, antibiotics and medications to
shunts. Dylan was discharged and, several weeks after the last presentation, was doing well
at home, other than occasional soft stools.

The combination of microcytosis and evidence of liver dysfunction (some combination of low
glucose, BUN, albumin, cholesterol, prolonged coagulation times) and mildly elevated liver
in a high risk breed. Dylan's case should be compared with other cases of portosystemic
shunts to observe variability in laboratory abnormalities that may occur with this condition.
Dylan and Pugsley (Chapter 5, Case 12) were microcytic, while YapYap (Chapter 3, Case 7)
and Binar (Chapter 2, Case 12, a cat) had normal MCV. While all of these cases were
characterized by hypoalbuminemia, only Dylan, YapYap, and Pugsley were hypoglycemic. All
except for YapYap had at least one elevated liver enzyme, but serum bilirubin was normal in
all cases. Only YapYap was hypocholesterolemic. BUN was low in all of the previous cases,
but Dylan's BUN was within reference intervals.
Case 3 - Level 1
"Princess" is a 6-year-old intact female German Shepherd that was hit by a car. She presents in 
lateral recumbancy with thready pulses. She has at least eight broken ribs and is extremely
painful. A quick PCV and total protein are within reference intervals at presentation. After fluid
therapy and medication for pain, samples are drawn for CBC and serum biochemical profile.

Interpretation
CBC: Princess has a moderate mature neutrophilic leukocytosis with lymphopenia and
monocytosis. Although inflammation is likely based on the degree of trauma, these findings
can be explained by corticosteroid effects alone. There is a normocytic, normochromic anemia
that does not appear to be regenerative at this time, however several days should be allowed
for the marrow to respond to an acute episode of blood loss. Serial reticulocytes counts would
Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia: Tissue trauma or necrosis is the most likely cause
the increase in AST. The hypocalcemia is most likely related to the hypoalbuminemia. Other
differential diagnoses include renal disease (the patient is not currently azotemic) or
hypoparathyroidism, which is possible but further diagnostic testing should not be pursued
unless the abnormalities are persistent once the current presenting problem is resolved.
Panhypoproteinemia: Decreases in both albumin and globulins are evidence of non-selective
protein losses. Of the many potential sites of protein loss, Princess is most likely to be
protein values because there has not been sufficient time for fluid shifts to occur that
compensate for the hypovolemia. Albumin is also a storage pool protein that may be
depleted if increased protein is required for tissue repair after trauma or surgery. With
extensive tissue damage or vascular compromise, protein may move from the circulation into
the interstitial space, further owering serum albumin concentration.
Increased ALT and AST: Hepatocellular damage may be related to direct trauma of the liver,
however perfusion deficits associated with hemorrhage and shock may contribute. While the
increased ALT indicates that a significant amount of the increase in AST may be hepatic, this
history of trauma and shock is also likely to result in damage to muscle and other tissues
which may contain and release AST. A CK could be measured to assess the muscle
component.
Case Summary and Outcome
Over the next few days, Princess began vomiting and developed hyperbilirubinemia and
elevations in ALP and GGT, which indicated cholestatic disease in addition to or as the result
of the initial hepatocellular damage (See Chapter 2 for further discussion of the relationship
of these two processes). A week after presentation, the ALT and AST were almost within
reference intervals, however the ALP and GGT remained elevated. At that time, schistocytes

disseminated intravascular coagulation. Breakdown of extravasated RBCs may have been
contributing to the hyperbilirubinemia. The coagulation panel was normal, however Princess
was treated with anticoagulants because of the potential for the development of thrombosis.
By 10 days after presentation, Princess appeared clinically improved and the bilirubin, ALP,
and GGT levels were declining. She was discharged and had an uneventful recovery at home.

minemia, although low ionized calcium has been described in dogs with malabsorptive
intestinal diseases due to the formation of calcium-fatty acid complexes in the intestinal
lumen or decreased absorption of Vitamin D (Kull).
Panhypoproteinemia: While both decreased production and increased losses may contribute
to low serum total protein, panhypoproteinemia is usually attributable to increased
nonselective loss of protein. Red Molly does not have any evidence of hemorrhage, severe
skin disease, or body cavity effusions, however she does present for gastrointestinal disease.
Liver dysfunction could compound increased losses of albumin, and could also account for
the hypocholesterolemia.

with severe protein losing enteropathy, decreased liver function, or malnutrition.
Case Summary and Outcome

proteinase activity levels were consistently high (mean 19.5 μg/g, reference interval 0-5.0),
supporting increased intestinal permeability. Unfortunately, this test does not differentiate
between the different types of intestinal lesions that can cause protein losing enteropathy.
cases in dogs are often attributable to inflammation or neoplasia (German). Definitive diagnosis
requires invasive procedures such as endoscopy or laparotomy with collection of biopsy
samples for histologic examination (Melzer). Even with biopsy, inter-observer variation between
pathologists' interpretations of biopsy samples can lead to confusion regarding diagnosis of
intestinal disease (Willard), and these patients are at risk for complications including delayed
healing due to low protein levels (Melzer). Red Molly's owners elected to try dietary
Red Molly is similar to the previous case (Princess), in that non-selective protein loss resulted
in decreases in both albumin and globulins. The clinical history provided critical information
about the likely sources of non-selective protein loss, which was supported somewhat by
other aboratory data (anemia compatible with hemorrhage in Princess and hypocholes-
terolemia in Red Molly)

Interpretation
CBC: Denver has thrombocytopenia and a mild normocytic normochromic nonregenerative
anemia. Because Denver is thrombocytopenic, hemorrhage is a possible cause for anemia
are generally regenerative and there is no history of bleeding. Anemia of chronic disease is
likely, although the concurrent thrombocytopenia suggests the possibility of a bone marrow 
disorder resulting in decreased production of erythrocytes and platelets. Peripheral
lymphadenopathy suggests the potential for hematopoietic neoplasia that may involve the
marrow, however the results of the lymph node aspirate are more suggestive for a reactive
process. Tick borne diseases may cause anemia, thrombocytopenia, and reactive lymphoid
hyperplasia, and this patient should be evaluated for these diseases. Tick borne disease may
cause thrombocytopenia either by suppressing production of platelets and/or increased
destruction associated with vasculitis or immune-medliated processes. Immune-medliated
thrombocytopenia (ITP) may be secondary to infectious disease, or it may be a primary
idiopathic process. ITP could be considered if the work-up for infectious disease is negative.
Peripheral consumption of platelets due to disseminated intravascular coagulation is unlikely
because the PT and APTT are essentially normal. The slight increase in APTT is not
considered clinically significant.
Serum Proteins
161
Serum Biochemical Profile
Mildly increased BUN with normal creatinine: Possible causes for disproportionately
increased BUN in this patient include pre-renal azotemia, early renal failure, high protein diet
concentrated urine, which is compatible with a combination of pre-renal azotemia with
possible early renal failure. There does not appear to be any non-renal factors that would
interfere with urinary concentrating ability at this time (e.g. osmotic diuresis, medullary
washout, liver failure, etc.; see Chapter 5). Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hypoproteinemia
could be compatible with gastrointestinal hemorrhage, so careful evaluation for melena,
hematochezia, and hematemesis is recommended.
Hypoproteinemia with hypoalbuminemia and normal globulins: Low serum levels of
albumin may occur as a result of decreased production, increased losses, or a combination of
the two. Albumin production may be low if there is severe prolonged starvation, if there is
severe liver dysfunction, or in the presence of inflammatory disease because albumin is a
negative acute phase reactant. Starvation is unlikely based on the physical examination. Liver
dysfunction is also unlikely given the normal cholesterol, normal liver enzymes, increased
BUN, and normal coagulation times, but specific tests of liver function have not been
which could result in low albumin production and increased globulin production. Protein
losses may be selective for albumin (glomerular losses) or non-selective (hemorrhage,
gastrointestinal, dermal, third space, interstitial). In this case, the albumin is low and globulins
are normal, suggesting selective glomerular protein loss, which is supported by the increased
urinary protein:creatinine ratio in the absence of indicators of inflammation in the urinary
tract (negative sedliment). Non-selective protein losses may also be occurring, which could
bring serum globulin levels back into the normal range despite increased production of acute
phase reactants and/or immunoglobulins associated with inflammation. The edema noted in

permeability, leading to interstitial loss of protein.
Mildly increased AST: In the absence of any other enzyme elevations, the clinical significance
reflect mild hemolysis or muscle damage.
Increased serum amylase: The increased amylase likely reflects decreased glomerular
filtration rate. Pancreatitis cannot be ruled out, but clinical signs expected with pancreatitis
are not obvious at this time.
Case Summary and Outcome

antibiotics for tick borne diseases, even though serologic evaluation for Lyme disease, Ehrlichia,
Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, heartworm, and leptospirosis were all negative. Unfortunately.

possible partial cruciate tear on the right. Serum antithrombin Ill (ATlll) levels were also
measured, and found to be low (47%, canine reference interval 75-120%). Antithrombin Ill is an
endogeneous anticoagulant protein that is of a similar size as albumin and may be lost via the
formation of thrombi, so Denver was also treated with anticoagulants.

Interpretation
CBC: Snickers has neutropenia and a mild normocytic normochromic nonregenerative
anemia. The anemia is likely due, in part, to acute gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The
neutropenia may be attributable to sepsis or severe acute inflammation in the gut, although
there is no toxic change or left shift to help substantiate this interpretation. Because a
bicytopenia is present, marrow disorders should also be considered. In such a young dog.
toxic insults should be ruled out, including medication; however the most common cause of
neutropenia in young dogs like Snickers is viral infection such as parvovirus. A parvovirus test
is strongly recommended, while a bone marrow evaluation is not indicated at this time.
Serum Biochemical Profile
Low serum creatinine: This value may be related to low muscle mass in puppies.
Panhypoproteinemia: The most obvious cause of the hypoproteinemia in this patient is
gastrointestinal loss, which is non-selective. Decreased production of albumin because of
starvation or liver dysfunction is possible, however not required to explain the hypoalbu
juvenile animals because they have been exposed to relatively small numbers of antigens
compared to adults.
testinal losses. The potassium is at the low end of the reference interval for the same
reasons, and may decrease further with continuing losses compounded by inadequate intake
Mildly increased HcO3: The mild alkalosis may be secondary to vomiting and loss of gastric
acid. Blood gas measurement is needed to fully characterize the acid/base disorder in this
patient and is probably not necessary at this time.
Mildly increased ALP and phosphorus: As described in Chapter 2, there are numerous
nonspecific causes for increased ALP in dogs. In the context of the normal values for the
may also be seen in young, growing animals; however, decreased perfusion secondary to
blood loss could also contribute to this change.

Interpretation
CBC: Susannah has a neutrophilic leukocytosis with a slight left shift and toxic changes,
compatible with inflammation. The lymphopenia may be related to corticosteroid effects. She
also has a normocytic, normochromic, nonregenerative anemia that is most likely due to 
inflammatory disease. However, since there is also thrombocytopenia, suppression of
production due to a primary bone marrow problem is possible. This seems less likely because
of the activity in the myeloid line. Increased consumption of platelets could be immune-
mediated or secondary to adhesion to activated or damaged endothelial cells. Hemorrhage
could cause both anemia and thrombocytopenia, and the black tarry stool is evidence of
melena. In general, blood loss anemias are regenerative, however concurrent inflammatory
166 Manual of Veterinary Clinical Chemisty: A Case Study Approach
potential for abnormal bleeding and/or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DlC) as a
cause for increased platelet consumption. Detection of increased fibrin degradlation products
would further support a diagnosis of DlC. Decreased liver function also may prolong
coagulation times.
Serum Biochemical Profile
Hypocalcemia with normal phosphorus: Low serum albumin explains the mild decrease in
calcium because of a decrease in the protein bound fraction in the blood. This is unlikely to
impact the biologically active ionized fraction and therefore should not cause clinical signs. If
Normal total protein with hypoalbuminemia and high-normal globulins: Hypoalbumiemia
could be due to decreased production and/or increased losses. The poor body condition
suggests that nutritional factors could impact albumin production in this case. Decreased
liver function could also be a contributor. Although no specific tests of liver function were
performed, low normal serum cholesterol, poorly concentrated urine, hyperbilirubinemia, and
(albumin is a negative acute phase reactant) or hyperglobulinemia (to maintain oncotic
pressure). Excessive losses of albumin in this patient may be accounted for by high protein
reference interval. Inflammation leading to a polyclonal gammopathy is most likely in
Susannah because of her age and leukogram data, however monoclonal gammopathies may
rarely be associated with inflammatory disease and must be distinguished from
paraneoplastic conditions associated with lymphoma or multiple myeloma
Hypokalemia: Decreased intake associated with a poor nutritional plane and the potential for
increased losses via the Gl tract or into the abdominal efusion account for the low serum

serum bilurubin. Abnormalities in the leukogram combined with fever and coagulation data
make cholestatic liver disease less likely, however decreased liver function is not always
associated with elevated liver enzymes (See Chapter 2). Given the anemia, a hemolytic
agglutination, Heinz bodies, spherocytes, schistocytes, etc, that would suggest a cause for
to the normocytic, normochromic anemia Susannah has at presentation. The increased serum
bilirubin explains the bilirubinuria and crystals in the urine.

Urinalysis: Since the patient is not azotemic and there is no description of dehydration in the

history does indicate increased water consumption, which could be in response to the
production of larger volumes of more dilute urine, or conversely, could cause the production
of larger volumes of more dilute urine. Urine concentrating ability is usually lost prior to the
development of azotemia during the progression of renal disease, although this may not
alwaysbetrueincats.
Abdominal fluid analysis: The results of this analysis indicate a non-septic exudate. One
study of 65 cats with peritoneal effusion showed the following causes in decreasing order of
frequency: cardiovascular disease, neoplasia, liver disease, renal disease, feline infectious
peritonitis, other peritoneal disease, and urinary tract trauma (Wright). Non-septic exudates
are often associated with neoplasia or feline infectious peritonitis.
Case Summary and Outcome
The combination of the neutrophilic leukocytosis with left shift, nonregenerative anemia, and
non-septic exudate in the abdomen was suggestive for feline infectious peritonitis (FiP) in this
young cat. A diagnosis of FiP may be suggested by the presence of this combination of
further work-up (Hartmann). A feline coronavirus titer was positive at 1:1600. Feline
coronavirus titers must be interpreted with care, since many cats that never develop FiP have
positive titers. Some cats with effusive FlP can have negative or low titers because antibodies
 are bound in the production of antigen-antibody complexes and are not available for binding
also occurs in cats with FlP and is unlikely in cats with other types of hepatobiliary disease.
Because of poor quality of life and questionable prognosis, Susannah was euthanized. At
necropsy, she had accumulation of gelatinous fluid in both the abdominal and thoracic
cavities. There were multifocal raised yellow nodules covering the liver, intestines and
kidneys, compatible with perivascular granuloma formation characteristic of FIP.
Note that multiple processes in this case are influencing Susannah's protein values and that
the sum of the abnormalities is resulting in a normal serum total protein value. This is a good
illustration of how a "normal" value does not rule out the presence of disease and
demonstrates that fractionation of total protein into albumin and globulins can be much
more informative than just the total protein value. In previous patients, a "normal" tota
protein value failed to reflect low serum albumin due to starvation (Belinda, Case 1) and

pancytopenia, the bone marrow should be evaluated for tumor infiltration. The hyperglobu-
linemia further suggests the possibility of a lymphoid malignancy as the cause for the
hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia of malignancy is often associated with normal or low
phosphorus. Decreased glomerular filtration rate secondary to hypercalcemic nephropathy
and/or dehydration may cause the serum phosphorus to be normal to increased.
minemia, the total serum protein level is high because of marked increases in serum
globulins. Hypoalbuminemia may be due to decreased production or increased osses, while
the hyperglobulinemia indicates increased production. Decreased production of albumin may
be related to nutritional status (unlikely here because the patient has good body condition),
decreased liver function (cannot be ruled out since blood ammonia or serum bile acids were
not measured, however BUN, cholesterol, and bilirubin are within reference intervals), a
compensatory change in response to inflammation (albumin is a negative acute phase
reactant) or a response to the increased oncotic pressure exerted by the high globulin levels.
Increased losses may occur with or without decreased production. Selective loss of albumin is
most frequently associated with glomerular lesions, and proteinuria is noted on the urinalysis.
This should be further evaluated by measuring a urine protein:creatinine ratio on a urine
urinary tract. A high urine protein:creatinine ratio in the absence of evidence of inflammatory
disease is compatible with glomerular protein loss. The test strips used for routine urinalysis
are more sensitive for albumin than globulins, and false negatives may occur in the rare case
where urine protein is predominantly globulin. Other types of protein loss (Gl, dermal, third
space, interstitial) are generally non-selective and result in loss of albumin and globulins. Loss
of globulin in this case may be masked by the marked hyperglobulinemia. Over production
of globulins is most often due to inflammatory disease, in which case both acute phase

reactants and immunoglobulins may be produced. The increase in immunoglobulins will
generally be polyclonal, however in rare cases inflammatory disease can cause a monoclonal

Leishmaniasis. Over production of globulins can be a paraneoplastic syndrome in which a

numbers of normal hematopoietic precursors (Figure 4-3). A monoclonal gammopathy was
documented by serum protein electrophoresis. Survey radiographs to look for lytic lesions

patient may have inflammatory disease, in this case pyometra, however due to age or
concurrent laboratory abnormalities, a more thorough diagnostic work-up is appropriate. In
Popcorn's case, hyperglobulinemia was associated with hypercalcemia, therefore a serum

 surgical correction of her pyometra.

"Salty" is an 11-year-old Quarter Horse stallion presenting for increasingly severe colic of 12
hours duration. On physical examination, Salty is depressed, painful, and attempting to lie 
down. His coat is drenched with sweat and he has tachycardia. There is dried blood on both
nares, possibly related to inadvertent removal of his nasogastric tube during transportation,
when he went down several times. He is moderately dehydrated with prolonged capillary
refill time and muddy mucous membranes. Salty was immediately treated for pain, however a
nasogastric tube could not be passed. Rectal palpation revealed severely distended large
bowel. His initial PCV was 60% and total solids were 6.6 g/dl. Further diagnostic evaluation
could not be performed because he had to be almost constantly walked to prevent him from
going clown. As a result, he received several liters of fluids before samples for further
laboratory evaluation could be collected.

Serum biochemical profile:
Hyperglycemia: The increased serum glucose is likely related to pain and stress.
Increased BUN and creatinine: Salty is significantly dehydrated and polycythemic at
presentation, so there is a pre-renal component to the azotemia. A urine sample could not

and the potential for renal disease.
Hyperalbuminemia: Dehydration/hemoconcentration is the cause for increase serum albumin.
Hypochloremia with normal serum sodium: At this time serum sodium is within the

The low serum chloride could be due to gastrointestinal losses or sweating.

contribute. Liver disease is less likely since the GGT is within the reference interval, however

Increased AST and CK: Elevations in both of these enzymes suggest muscle damage and are
compatible with Salty's travel history and episodes of recumbency.

Manual of Veterinary Clinical Chemisty: A Case Study Approach
Interpretation
CBC: Lymphopenia may either be due to the effects of treatment with corticosteroids or
associated with loss through compromised intestines.
Serum Biochemical Profile
Hypocalcemia with normal phosphorus: Decreased total serum calcium is likely associated
with malabsorptive intestinal disease (See Case 4, Red Molly). Corticosteroids may also lower
calcium.
Panhypoproteinemia: With Twister's clinical history, progression or acute exacerbation of the
pre-existing lymphangiectasia is the most obvious cause for the panhypoproteinemia.
associated with poor body condition. Decreased liver function could impair Twister's ability to
produce sufficient albumin to compensate for ongoing losses. Low-normal BUN and mild
hyperbilirubinemia may occur with impaired hepatic function. Her liver enzymes are elevated
compared to the earlier values determined at the time of initial diagnosis which could
ALP and GGT suggest cholestasis, but may also be influenced by the presence of
uribinemia, and causes of cholestasis should be evaluated.
Increased ALP and GGT: As indicated above, both cholestasis and corticosteroid effects may
be increasing the amount of these enzymes in the circulation.
Increased ALT and AST: Increases in these enzymes indicate hepatocellular damage, but do
secondary to the toxic effects of bile on the hepatocytes (see Chapter 2). Intestinal disease
can be associated with increased liver enzymes because the anatomic relationship between
the gut and the liver allow greater exposure of hepatocytes to bacteria, toxins, or
inflammatory cytokines from compromised bowel. Twister originally presented with elevated
ALP and ALT. These values are higher now and may indicate progression of the original
disease or additional pathologic processes. Pancreatic disease, suggested by the markedly
elevated lipase, can also cause secondary liver damage.
Hyperlipasemia with normal amylase: Both amylase and lipase levels in the blood may
increase 3-4 times normal when the glomerular filtration rate is decreased, however this is
unlikely in this patient as she is not azotemic. Administration of corticosteroids has been
reported to increase serum lipase in dogs up to 3-4 times the upper limit of the reference
exceeds what has been associated with steroid use alone. Hyperlipasemia of 11-93 times the
upper limit of the reference range was reported in 6 dogs with tumors of the pancreas or
liver (Quigley), which could also account for the other enzyme elevations that are present in
this patient.
Case Summary and Outcome
The ultrasound study of Twister's abdomen revealed multiple complex masses in the liver with
enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes and a thickened gastrointestinal tract. Aspiration cytology
Serum Proteins175
of one of the liver masses was compatible with epithelial neoplasia, likely of biliary origin
(Figure 4-4) although no histology was available to confirm this impression. Twister was
euthanized because of deteriorating quality of life and poor prognosis.
Figure 4-4. Smears from the liver
mass contain clusters of cuboidal
epithelial cells characterized by
scant to moderate basophilic
cytoplasm and single round to oval
nuclei with coarsely stippled
chromatin. Cells occur in branching
papillary fronds. Cells appear to
have lost polarity and pile up in
disorganized masses. These
findings were compatible with
epithelial neoplasia,likely of bile
duct origin.
Twister's data must be interpreted in the context of her previous diagnosis and therapy, both of
which could influence her clinical chemistry data. Her data at this second presentation are
significantly different from her initial values, which could be related to the effects of the corti-
costeroids or progression of disease. Unfortunately, the progression or resolution of clinical
 signs do not always correlate with laboratory parameters. Some patients have good clinical
response to therapy with minimal changes in laboratory values, and some have no amelioration
of clinical signs despite improvement in laboratory abnormalities. Hence the saying, "treat the
patient, not the laboratory work."
For Twister, the hyperbilirubinemia and the dramatic hyperlipasemia with normal amylase were
important pieces of information that indicated a new disease process should be considered
the normalization of the serum cholesterol may have been the result of increased production
secondary to cholestasis rather than decreased gastrointestinal loss following improvement of
the lymphangiectasia. This is potentially a patient in which two disease processes working in
phenomenon can sometimes be an issue in dehydrated hypoalbuminemic patients that initially
 present with albumin in the normal range, or in hyperglobulinemic patients in which non-
selective protein loss drops the globulin value down to within the reference interval.
Twister's case can be compared with Case 4, Red Molly, who also had a protein losing
enteropathy with panhypoproteinemia, hypocalcemia, and hypocholesterolemia, however Molly
did not have associated liver enzyme elevations as a result of her intestinal disease. Two cases
from Chapter 3, have hyperlipasemia associated with pancreatic/hepatic neoplasialike Twister.
Shorty the cat (Chapter 3, Case 13) had pancreatic neoplasia with metastases to the liver,
however Shorty's liver enzymes were within reference intervals, demonstrating that normal

Case 11 - Level 3
"June" is a one-year-old spayed female domestic short haired cat presenting with a history of
chronic respiratory and sinus infections. On physical examination, June is thin, quiet, and
responsive. She is slightly hypothermic and has pale mucous membranes. While she has
obvious dyspnea and tachypnea, her right thorax is quiet on auscultation and 200 ml of
purulent fluid is removed. Blood is collected for analysis. She is placed in an oxygen cage
and treated with intravenous fluids and antibiotics. June suffers cardiopulmonary arrest
during chest tube placement, but is successfully resuscitated.

Pleural fluid analysis
Post-spin appearance: yellow and clear
Total protein: 3.4 g/dl
Total nucleated cell count: 63,700/μl
Description: There are massive numbers of degenerate neutrophils
with small numbers of macrophages. Large numbers of intracellular
and extracellular bacteria are present. While predominantly rod
shaped, bacteria are of mixed morphology with long, short, and
chaining organisms noted. Both Gram positive and negative organisms
are present.
Interpretation
 CBC: June has a neutrophilic leukocytosis with an extreme left shift and marked toxic change
compatible with severe inflammation; the focus is assumed to be the thoracic cavity based on
the gross appearance of the fluid removed via thoracocentesis. The mature lymphocytosis
 may be attributable to either epinephrine effects or antigenic stimulation, although no
reactive cells are described to dlifferentiate between the two mechanisms. June has a
normocytic, normochromic, nonregenerative anemia. This is most likely anemia of
inflammation. Increased numbers of nucleated red blood cells may be part of a regenerative
response to anemia or may reflect increased release secondary to endothelial damage in
the septic focus in the thorax.
Serum Biochemical Profile
Increased BUN with low creatinine: Decreased glomerular filtration or slow renal tubular
flow rates increasing available time for reabsorption of urea could explain the increased BUN.
urinary bladder at presentation and did not produce sufficient urine for collection until after
therapy was instituted. Sepsis may also increase the BUN because of intensified protein
turnover. The low creatinine may be due to low muscle mass.
Hypocalcemia with hyperphosphatemia and hypermagnesemia: Low serum albumin explains
the mild decrease in calcium because of a decrease in the protein bound fraction in the blood.
This is unlikely to impact the biologically active ionized fraction and therefore should not cause
measured. In the context of the clinical presentation and increased BUN, hyperphosphatemia
Hypoproteinemia with hypoalbuminemia and normal globulins: Hypoalbumiemia could be
due to decreased production and/or increased losses. Poor body condition suggests that
nutritional factors could impact albumin production in this case. Decreased liver function
178 Manual of Veterinary Clinical Chemisty: A Case Study Approach
a healthy liver may be downregulated in response to inflammation because albumin is a
megative acute phase reactant. Third space loss of protein into the effusion may be
decreasing both albumin and globulin since it is a non-selective site of protein loss. The
potential for renal loss of protein cannot be evaluated without a urinalysis. With nonselective
protein loss, globulins may be maintained within the normal range by increased production
secondary to antigenic stimulation.
Hyperbilirubinemia: Sepsis, liver disease, and hemolysis may all be factors in causing June's
hyperbilirubinemia. Significant cholestatic liver dlisease is ruled out based on the normal ALP
and GGT. Hemolytic anemias are typically regenerative given sufficient time, and June's anemia
is non-regenerative at presentation, making this less likely than sepsis and liver disease as causes
for this abnorma lity.
Increased ALT and AST:
Increased ALT suggests hepatocellular damage, which may be related to hypoxia (anemia and
respiratory dlifficulty), sepsis, or hypoperfusion related to shock. Since the increase in AST is
greater than the elevation in ALT, some of the increase in this enzyme may be related to muscle
damage from the same causes. No CK is available to confirm this impression.

Case Summary and Outcome
Further testing performed while June was hospitalized revealed the presence of feline leukemia
virus (FeLV) antigen. She was feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) negative. Despite June's
condition at presentation and FelV status, she responded well to treatment and was discharged
6 days after presentation on oral antibiotics. She was re-evaluated 6 weeks later. At that time her
lungs were clear and she had gained some weight, but had some residual upper airway stridor.
All of her laboratory abnormalities were resolved except for a persistent non-regenerative
megakaryocytic activity was normal and there was no evidence of dysplasia in the erythroid line.
The suppression of red blood cell production was assumed to be related to June's FelV status.

This case is similar to Susannah (Case 7), in which poor body condition, severe inflammatory
disease, and cavity effusion combine to influence serum protein data. In both cases, the
globulin levels are within reference intervals despite the expected increases in acute phase
reactants and/or immunoglobulins. This may reflect concurrent protein losses, however note
that the reference interval is much greater for albumin than globulin, indicating greater

Interpretation
CBC: On Day 1, Ellis is leukopenic due to neutropenia with no evidence of a left shift or toxic
change. This may be due to acute margination of granulocytes, or consumption in an acute,
overwhelming inflammatory process. The thrombocytopenia could also be due to increased
 The polycythemia is likely related to dehydration, as supported by the increased serum 
albumin. Normoblastemia (increased nRBCs) could be compatible with a regenerative
time (no polychromasia). Increased numbers of nucleated erythrocytes can be present in the
circulation associated with endothelial damage of any cause, including sepsis, shock,
hyperthermia, neoplasia, or any potential cause of hypoxia or hypoglycemia. Given the
neutropenia in combination with the thrombocytopenia and metarubricytosis, a marrow
disorder leading to depressed production of cells is possible. If peripheral processes cannot

By Day 2, neutrophil numbers have normalized, however there is a minor increase in bands

and peripheral consumption is suspected. In contrast to the previous polycythemia, Ellis is
now mildly anemic with a mild macrocytosis that could be explained by incipient

Serum Proteins
181
Serum Biochemical Profile
Glucose: On day 1, the serum glucose is at the lower end of the reference range, which is
compatible with sepsis (see leukogram data), however on day 2, there is mild hyperglycemia
that could be nonspecifically related to stress, illness, or to administration of glucose
containing fluids.
Increased creatinine with high normal BUN: On day 1, the polycythemia and hyperalbu-
minemia suggest that Ellis is dehydrated, compatible with some degree of pre-renal
compromised renal function. Glucosuria indicates the potential for osmotic diuresis.
Glucosuria in association with low normal blood glucose levels is evidence of renal tubular
cysfunction if the urine sample does not contain contaminants that could cause a false
positive reaction on the test strip. Urinalysis should be repeated to cetermine if there was
transient renal dysfunction related to an acute event or if longer term compromise in rena
function is likely.
Hypercalcemia with normal phosphorus: Generally, one of the primary differential diagnoses

protein bound calcium associated with hyperproteinemia. This interpretation is supported by
associated with the diarrhea or to low serum protein. Like calcium, a proportion of serum
magnesium is protein bound.
auiaadodyued pw uay ', Aea uo ungie wnas paseaui yim enauiodad
on day 2: Because the liver does not overproduce albumin, increased serum albumin is
evidence of dehydration. The dramatic change on the following day reflects correction of fluid
deficits as well as some type of non-selective protein loss. The thrombocytopenia indicates risk
for gastrointestinal lesions. The thrombocytopenia and metarubricytosis are compatible with
endothelial damage, which could increase vascular permeability and allow loss of protein into
the interstitial space. Proteinuria is present and can be quantified by measuring a urine
protein:creatinine ratio. Because pyuria is also noted on the sediment examination, urinary
tract inflammation rather than selective glomerular loss of albumin should be ruled out first.
Urine culture is recommended to document any treatable infectious causes for the pyuria and
proteinuria.
Acidemia (low HCO3) with increased anion gap: These abnormalities indicate a metabolic
for lactic acidosis from decreased perfusion of tissues, while the azotemia could be
compatible with uremic acidosis as well. Acid/base status normalizes by Day 2
Mild hyperbilirubinemia: Potential causes of hyperbilirubinemia in this case include sepsis
by serum bile acid or blood ammonia measurement), cholestasis (increased ALP), or
hemolysis (less likely because the bilirubin is high when Ellis is polycythemic, but normal by
the time his anemia develops). Whatever the cause, the hyperbilirubinemia is minimal and
transient, and unlikely to be clinically significant.

Increased ALP: There are numerous potential hepatic and extrehepatic causes of elevatec
complete medication history should be taken to rule out the influence of medications,
particularly anti-convulsants, corticosteroids, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Various
endocrinopathies and metabolic disorders can increased ALP, but are uncommon in young
dogs. In the context of the clinical history and other elevated liver enzymes, some degree of
hepatic damage is likely, and the increased ALP could suggest a cholestatic component.
Increased ALT and AST: These enzyme changes indicate hepatocellular damage, possibly in
combination with some muscle damage, however a CK is not available to corroborate that
interpretation. Decreased perfusion associated with shock is likely to be a factor in this
patient; sepsis is another possibility. The potential for trauma such as being hit by a car

Case Summary and Outcome
Ellis was treated with plasma, fluids, and broad spectrum antibiotics. His history, clinical signs,
reflect thermal endothelial damage compounded by hypovolemia, shock, and possible
bacteremia/endotoxemia from translocation of gut organisms through compromised bowel.
Changes in the clinical chemistry profile also largely reflect the same processes, however
acute renal compromise and liver damage can be the results of hemodynamic instability and
thermal injury to renal tubular cells and hepatocytes. This case may be compared with Sally
(Chapter 5, Case 14), who suffered from more severe heat stroke. While Ellis responded well

combination of the neutropenia and thrombocytopenia could be compatible with a primary
marrow problem, however since these changes can be explained by sepsis, bone marrow
evaluation is not indlicated at this time.

Mildly increased BUN: This is compatible with dehydration and pre-renal azotemia, however
sepsis may also increase the BUN. A urine specific gravity should be performed to ensure
adequate urinary concentrating ability and rule out renal failure.
Hypocalcemia: Low total calcium in this case is attributed to hypoalbuminemia
Hypomagnesemia: Low intake is the likely cause of the hypomagnesemia.

buminemia in this horse. While Cha-Cha has not been eating well lately, starvation must be
advanced before it causes hypoalbuminemia. Serum albumin is a storage pool of protein,
which may be depleted after surgery or trauma. Decreased hepatic production of albumin is
possible given the elevated liver enzymes, however these are not adequate liver function
tests (See Chapter 2) and the absence of a pre-surgical history of liver enzyme elevations or
signs of liver disease makes this less likely. A severe, acute, diffuse liver insult cannot be ruled

also possible, but is not described in the clinical history and does not appear likely with
polycythemia.
Hyponatremia and hypochloremia: These electrolyte changes are proportional and reflect
gastrointestinal losses that exceed water losses or volume repletion with hypotonic solutions.
Low anion gap: Hypoalbuminemia can cause a decreased anion gap because is it an
unmeasured anion.
Hyperbilirubinemia: In horses, anorexia should always be considered as a cause of hyper-
bilirubinemia. The concurrently elevated ALP, AST, and LDH indicate that liver disease is
another potential contributor to increased serum bilirubin. Hemolysis as a cause of hyper-
bilirubinemia is unlikely given the polycythemia.
Increased ALP, AST, LDH, and CK: The increased ALP, AST, and LDH are compatible with liver
disease, however these enzymes are not liver specific. The CK is also elevated, supporting 
some contribution by muscle damage. GGT is more liver specific than the ALP in large
animals, however it is normal at this time. LDH has a short halflife, and suggests on going.

Evaluate body condition and diet for nutritional influences, which are rare (Case 1).
Consider increased demand for protein if the patient is febrile or has a history of surgery

Tests of Renal Function
The kidney is a central organ in the regulation of electrolyte, acid/base, and fluid balance, in
addition to having an important endocrine role in controlling calcium and phosphorus
homeostasis and erythropoiesis. This chapter will focus on BUN, creatinine, and urine specific
gravity as tests of renal function. Other abnormalities associated with renal disease will be
explained as has been the case in previous chapters, however for more detailed discussions
of electrolytes and minerals, the reader is referred to appropriate chapters in this text.
Urinalysis data will be discussed when available for the cases in this chapter, but a complete
review of urinalysis is beyond the scope of the book. The reader is referred to several
excellent resources for this intormation in the begining ot this text.
Two sets of definitions should be reviewed prior to discussing tests of renal function. Both
will be important for describing and classifying patients with renal disease.
This is routinely assessed by the measurement of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine.
Uremia: The loss of a critical amount of renal function resulting in a group of clinical signs
that can include lethargy, anorexia, mucosal ulceration, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss,
anemia, altered urine output, and hyperparathyroidism.
In general, as renal disease progresses, urinary concentrating ability is lost first, followed by
the development ot azotemia. Cats may retain some concentrating ability despite the
always azotemic and isosthenuric. In contrast, patients may be azotemic for some period of
azotemia, the condition is described as pre-renal, renal, or post-renal. These three
descriptors of azotemia are not mutually exclusive; as will be seen in the cases, any of the
Pre-renal azotemia: This occurs when there is reduced renal perfusion because of
Renal perfusion may be reduced because of low cardiac output secondary to primary
heart disease, or if blood pressure cannot be maintained because of systemic
vasodilation that is the result of shock or sepsis. When pre-renal azotemia occurs in
patients with normal renal function, the urine is generally concentrated, which helps rule
out renal azotemia. In some cases, however, extra-renal factors such as medullary
wash-out, osmotic diuresis, or endocrine disorders interfere with the kidney's ability to
concentrate urine in the absence of significant renal parenchymal damage.
azotemia. The presence or degree of confirmed renal azotemia does not distinguish an
acute from a chronic process. As will be seen below, BUN and serum creatinine are not
renal factors.
Post-renal azotemia: Failure of urine to be excreted from the body causes post-renal
azotemia, which is generally diagnosed by clinical signs such as minimal to absent
urinations and possible abdominal distension as urine accumulates. Physical obstruction
of urine flow and uroabdomen are two causes of post-renal azotemia. Please note that
some patients with post-renal azotemia may be able to pass small amounts of urine. The
obstruction of flow does not need to be complete to cause azotemia.

Although creatinine and BUN are most commonly thought of as indicators of renal function,
Creatinine measured in the blood originates from either consumption of animal tissues or
be clinically significant), muscle mass, and muscle damage or breakdown could influence
serum creatinine concentrations. Volume expansion could dilute serum creatinine. Most of
the creatinine formed in the body is eliminated by the kidney, although small amounts may
 be lost in sweat, in the gastrointestinal tract, or via biochemical recycling pathways.
Creatinine is freely filtered in the glomerulus, with a small amount of active transport into the
while increased glomerular filtration can slightly decrease serum creatinine concentrations. In
general, creatinine is less influenced by extra-renal factors than BUN, however some
creatinine assays lack analytic specificity and will measure substances other than creatinine.
This may result in some variation in serum creatinine unrelated to changes in GFR in the
normal range of serum creatinine concentrations. These noncreatinine chromagens are
present in small, relatively constant quantities in the blood and this interference is unlikely to
azotemia in patients with renal failure
Small amounts of urea are ingested in the diet, however the majority of blood urea nitrogen
creatinine, protein metabolism can influence BUN. High protein diets or increased muscle
catabolism can increase BUN, and there is some evidence that individuals with compromised
renal function may have impaired ability to eliminate an acute urea load even though they
may not be azotemic in the fasted state. Conversely, low muscle mass, low protein diet, or
poor urea cycle activity associated with liver failure may lower BUN. Some urea may be lost
in the gastrointestinal tract, and in ruminants, gut bacteria may utilize sufficient quantities to
blunt elevations in BUN when the GFR is compromised. Unlike creatinine, urea undergoes
some passive reabsorption in the collecting ducts. Higher tubular flow rates decrease the
amount of time available for reabsorption, and decrease BUN while low tubular flow rates
result in greater urea reabsorption. This means that changes in urine flow can alter BUN with
no significant change in total glomerular filtration rate.
As noted above, neither creatinine nor BUN is a sensitive indicator of decreased rena
function, and patients may have lost as much as 75% of renal function prior to the
development of azotemia. In addition, BUN and creatinine do not change linearly with further
decrements in renal function, so a patient whose creatinine doubles may have less than half
of the original glomerular filtration rate. The ability of non-renal factors to impact serum
creatinine and BUN can also contribute to variation in azotemia unrelated to true changes in
renal function. Finally, it should be noted that significant glomerular lesions can occur that
result in protein losing nephropathy in the absence of azotemia. Eventually, glomerular

no decrease in the glomerular filtration rate. No fever, sepsis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, or
trauma are present in the history to suggest these potential causes of increased BUN with

clusters of anaplastic transitional epithelial cells characterized by scant to abundlant deeply
basophilic cytoplasm; occasional cells have cytoplasmic tails characteristic of transitional
hyaline material. Most cells contain a single round to oval nucleus, although scattered
binucleated cells with nuclear molding were also present. Some cells contain small but
prominent nucleoli. The nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio is high but markedly variable.
Anisocytosis and anisokaryosis were marked. The diagnosis was transitional cell carcinoma.

indication on the serum biochemical profile. What azotemia is present is attributable to the
post-renal obstructive effects of the transitional cell carcinoma. Increased pressure in the
tubules secondary to outflow obstruction can result in either transient or permanent
decreases in tubular function depending on the duration and severity of the pressure. Renal
function may increase over time as temporary losses of renal tubular function are regained
and as remaining functional nephrons undergo compensatory hypertrophy with enhanced
function. Alternatively, there may be ongoing losses of renal function because at a certain
point, renal lesions can progress despite correction of the initial cause of injury. Because of
these factors, sequential serum biochemical profiles on the patient may show normalization
of abnormalities or progressive azotemia with the development of other biochemical
obstruction, however the long-term prognosis is poor.
This case should be compared with Case 1, Marklar, in which pre-renal factors caused a more
degree of azotemia does not always distinguish pre-renal from renal changes or their
potential reversibility. Marklar's ability to concentrate his urine was a key indicator of
adequaterenal function despite the azotemia.

CBC: Marsali is anemic. With the limited clinical history, anemia of chronic disease or
malnutrition are likely causes, however poor management also suggests the possibility of 
parasitism. Blood loss is possible with the concurrent hypoalbuminemia, however nutritional
factors could influence this analyte as well.
Serum Biochemical Profile
Hypoglycemia: This change is minimal and is unlikely to be clinically significant. Anorexia is
an uncommon cause of hypoglycemia but is more likely in cases of advanced starvation like
Marsali. Even under these extreme circumstances, blood glucose is often maintained within
or just slightly below reference range.
Low BUN and creatinine: Low protein diets and poor muscle mass can result in decreased
BUN and creatinine. Increased glomerular filtration rate and water retention associated with
pregnancy can decrease creatinine, while polyuria can decrease BUN. Marsali was not
pregnant and her urine output appeared to be normal.
Hyperproteinemia characterized by hypoalbuminemia and hyperglobulinemia: Both
decreased hepatic production and increased losses can lower serum albumin. Marsali is one
of the rare cases in which decreased production may be due to starvation. Because albumin
is a negative acute phase reactant, hepatic production may be suppressed with inflammation.
This mechanism seems plausible given the hyperglobulinemia, however supporting evidence
such as hyperfibrinogenemia and an inflammatory leukogram are not available in this case.
Tests of Renal Funcion 
199
Because albumin is a readily usable protein reserve, hypoalbuminemia can occur with fever,
surgery, or other causes of increased catabolism. Selective loss of albumin is characteristic of
glomerular lesions, while most other causes of protein loss (gastrointestinal, dermal, or third
space loss) include both albumin and globulins. Hyperglobulinemia is due to increased acute
phase reactants and/or immunoglobulins. Polyclonal expansions are associated with antigenic
stimulation, and infectious disease is likely given the management at Marsali's farm.
Hyperglobulinemia due to monoclonal gammopathy is often associated with hematopoietic
malignancies such as lymphoma or multiple myeloma, although in small animals, infectious
diseases such as feline infectious peritonitis, tick borne pathogens and Leishmania rarely can
cause monoclonal gammopathy.

Serum Biochemical Profile
evidence of renal failure. In general, this is true, however in some cases, extra-renal factors
may interfere with urinary concentrating ability in the absence of significant structural renal
pyometra. In this case, the patient is hyposthenuric, which implies some ability of the kidney
to modify the filtrate, and therefore some renal function. Hypercalcemia can result in
subsequent renal failure in the long term. If the azotemia is merely due to the obligatory fluid
losses associated with temporary polyuria, the azotemia may be pre-renal. It may not be
possible to determine which is more likely from the data available at this time. Imaging
studies of the kidney and repeat biochemistry and urinalysis after correction of hypercalcemia
mechanisms tor azotemia associated with hypercalcemia.
Hypercalcemia with normal phosphorus: After ruling out laboratory artifact, hypercalcemia
of malignancy should be a primary differential diagnosis in this case. Lymphoma is a common
apocrine gland adenocarcinoma, and other carcinomas also may be associated with
hypercalcemia of malignancy, although concurrent decrements in glomerular filtration rate
demonstrating increased concentrations of parathyroid hormone related protein (PTHrP) and
low to normal parathyroid hormone (PTH). Another consideration for hypercalcemia with
normal to low serum phosphorus is primary hyperparathyroidism. In that case, the presence
of a parathyroid tumor with an elevated PTH but normal PTHrP would be expected. Renal
failure and hypervitaminosis D may also elevate serum calcium, but are typically associated
with hyperphosphatemia. Other causes of hypercalcemia such as skeletal lesions and bone
growth, granulomatous disease, hemoconcentration, or hypoadrenocorticism are less likely
Hypokalemia: A combination of decreased intake with anorexia and increased losses due to
polyuria contribute to hypokalemia in this case. Gastrointestinal losses are also possible with
the history of vomiting. There is no evidence of acid/base abnormalities that would cause
intracellular translocation of potassium.
Case Summary and Outcome
Ultrasound evaluation of the parathyroid gland and abdomen failed to reveal any lesions,
however a bone marrow aspirate contained large numbers of immature lymphocytes
compatible with a lymphoid neoplasm (Figure 5-3). This was considered sufficient to explain
of malignancy will be discussed in greater detail in Chapter 6, but briefly, PTHrP stimulates

hypercalcemia resolved with therapy. After his calcium levels normalized, Jag began
concentrating his urine again with no observable deficit in renal function. Jag should be
compared with Marklar in Case 1, who had pre-renal azotemia with concentrated urine, which
generally accompanies decreased GFR, except in cases like Jag, where other factors may be
owering serum phosphorus.

cell is a megakaryocyte.
Jag is a good example of a patient with azotemia and a low urine specific gravity that does
not have irreversible chronic renal failure, although it was not possible to be sure of this
based on only the initial blood work. Hypercalcemia can cause a nephrogenic diabetes
insipidus-like syndrome because of decreased tubular reabsorption of sodium and
mediated by calcium-sensing receptors on renal epithelial cells and are designed to promote
excretion of excess calcium. Renal medullary blood flow may increase in hypercalcemic dogs,
with resultant medullary washout and impaired concentrating ability. Production of large
amounts of dilute urine results in dehydration and pre-renal azotemia
With chronic and severe hypercalcemia, calcium-mediated vasoconstriction and subsequent
ischemia combined with direct toxic effects of calcium on renal tubular cells can cause
permanent nephron loss and renal failure. At this point, the patient is typically isosthenuric,
and other clinical and laboratory signs of renal failure may become apparent.

Interpretation
CBC: Sheba has mild toxic change, which could be compatible with inflammation or marrow
insult. Future CBC's should be monitored for additional evidence of inflammation. Sheba also
has a normocytic, normochromic anemia and thrombocytopenia. A reticulocyte count should 
be done to determine if the anemia is nonregenerative. Anemia of chronic disease should
always be considered as a potential cause of mild nonregenerative anemia. The isosthenuria
and azotemia are evidence of renal damage, which may result in a nonregenerative anemia
because of inadequate production of erythropoietin and the toxic effects of uremia on the
bone marrow microenvironment. Sheba should also be evaluated for acute blood loss, which
could initially cause a nonregenerative anemia and thrombocytopenia. The low normal
protein and hypoalbuminemia may be compatible with blood loss. Blood loss is not always
obvious to owners, especially if the losses are gastrointestinal and up to a week may be
required to see evidence of regeneration on a CBC. If no peripheral causes for the
bicytopenia can be found, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy are indicated.
Serum Biochemical Profile
Azotemia and isosthenuria: This combination of laboratory abnormalities in a dehydrated
patient is suggestive for renal failure, but there are exceptions when extra-renal factors
interfere with renal concentrating ability (See Chapter 5, Case 4). Osmotic diuresis, medullary
washout, and liver failure are unlikely based on the fact that all of the abnormalities on the
serum biochemical profile can be explained by renal disease alone. Diabetes insipidus is a
consideration, but is ess likely.

Hypoalbuminemia: Increased losses of albumin appear most likely in this case, and include

the urine. The inactive urine sediment makes lower urinary tract disease unlikely, and
glomerular loss of protein is suspected as the primary route of protein loss. Causes of
decreased production of albumin contributing to the hypoalbuminemia in this case may
include starvation, acute phase changes (albumin is a negative acute phase reactant), and
liver failure. Depending on her body condition, anorexia/cachexia may be a consideration,
but is usually only associated with extreme nutritional deprivation and poor body condition
that could produce an acute phase response. Liver failure is unlikely given normal glucose,
cholesterol, and bilirubin, although these are insensitive indicators of liver function. Serum
bile acid or blood ammonia measurement is preferred to confirm poor hepatic function.
the azotemia and hyperphosphatemia. Clinical signs are vague, and pancreatic disease
cannot be completely ruled out.
Case Summary and Outcome
Sheba had hypertension, assumed to be secondary to renal disease, and was treated with
reactive hyperplasia and antigenic stimulation; however, there was no evidence of neoplasia.
Because of the shifting leg lameness, lymphoid hyperplasia, and thrombocytopenia, samples
were collected for serologic titers to Lyme disease, Ehrlichia, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever,
and Leptospirosis. All of the titers were negative except that for Lyme disease, which was
positive. Sheba was treated with appropriate antibiotics. During the second day of her hospi-

was initiated for her renal disease, however she developed severe edema after 24 hours, and
the fluids were discontinued. Both the hypoproteinemia and the potential for vasculitis could
have potentiated the development of edema. At discharge, Sheba's treatment plan included
antibiotics, antihypertensive medications, and subcutaneous fluids.
No kidney biopsy was performed, however hypoalbuminemia with proteinuria and no
evidence of lower urinary tract disease or pyelonephritis is strong evidence of glomerular
disease. Clinical signs associated with glomerular disease can be varied and non-specific. At
least in the early phases of the disease, significant glomerular disease can be present without
significant changes in glomerular filtration rate or BUN and creatinine. The degree of

Sheba currently has both of these risk factors. Glomerular damage eventually leads to loss of
nephrons and chronic renal failure, however the progression of disease is variable and some
patients with glomerular disease may have stable renal function for extended periods of
time. In Sheba's case, the history of shifting leg lameness and reactive lymphoid hyperplasia
suggest the possibility of antigen:antibody complex deposition as a cause for
 glomerulopathy. Lyme disease itself can be associated with a rapidly progressive membrano-
proliferative glomerulonephritis accompanied by tubular lesions and interstitial inflammation,
culminating in renal failure (Dambach). Substantiating a diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis in dogs
is complicated by the absence of a pathognomonic signs of infection such as the presence of

Serum Biochemical Profile
Azotemia and isosthenuria: This combination of laboratory abnormalities is suggestive for renal
failure, and the ultrasound findings demonstrate a cause for post-renal obstruction of urine flow
with the secondary development of renal lesions resulting in renal failure. If the patient is
dehydrated, a pre-renal component may be superimposed on the other causes of azotemia.
Hyperphosphatemia and hypercalcemia: The hyperphosphatemia is the result of decreased
glomerular filtration rate, whether due to renal or pre-renal factors. Calcium changes
unpredictably in renal failure, and total calcium may be high, low or normal. In older patients,
reported in people with transitional cell carcinoma (Grubb) and may be related to the
presence of bone metastases in animals with transitional cell carcinoma (Rosol). Further
characterization of the pathophysiology of the hypercalcemia might be possible by
measuring ionized calcium (which is most often high in hypercalcemia of malignancy and
most often, but not always, low in chronic renal failure), measuring parathyroid hormone
related protein (PTHrP), or documenting bone metastases.

Manual of Veter inary Clinical Chemisty: A Case Study Approach
Interpretation
CBC: The mild mature neutrophilic leukocytosis is compatible with inflammation.
Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: Given the history, the most likely cause for the hyperglycemia and glucosuria
is stress, although supportive changes in the leukogram are not present. Diabetes mellitus
suggestive clinical signs such as polyphagia, weight loss, and polyuria/polydipsia. Note that
the glucosuria merely reflects hyperglycemia that causes the glomerular filtrate to have a
glucose content that exceeds the renal tubular maximum for glucose reabsorption. A single
finding of glucosuria does not by itself justify a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.
Azotemia: Azotemia should be categorized as pre-renal, renal, or post-renal. The minimally
presence of a large, firm bladder is suspicious, and this cat may have post-renal azotemia
related to urethral blockage.
Hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia: The most likely cause of hyperphosphatemia in this
patient is decreased glomerular filtration rate, regardless of whether the decreased GFR is
due to pre-renal, renal, or post-renal causes. Dogs and cats in renal failure may have high,
mormal, or low serum calcium levels, and ionized calcium levels may not correlate with total
calcium levels as they often do in healthy animals. In a small study of cats with urethral
obstruction, 75% had low ionized calcium, and 27% had low total calcium (Drobatz). All cats
Renal seconcdary hyperparathyroidism and primary hypoparathyroidism may also cause hyper-
phosphatemia and hypocalcemia. PTH levels will be increased in renal secondary hyper-
parathyroidism as the body attempts to increase serum calcium that has dropped in response
to the hyperphosphatemia resulting from the low GFR. In contrast, low PTH levels in primary
hypoparathyroidism cannot maintain adequate calcium levels in the blood and fail to
promote the excretion of phosphorus into the urine.
Hypochloremia and normal sodium: Loss of chloride in excess of sodium in the gastroin-
not described in the history. Chronic respiratory acidosis will trigger increased excretion of 
chloride by the kidney. Diuretic use can potentiate urinary chloride loss. Because Ringo has
oliguric/anuric renal failure. Increased intake or oversupplementation or drug effects are not
compatible with the clinical history, and translocation due to acute inorganic acidosis also

Hypocalcemia may potentiate the effects of hyperkalemia on the heart.
Increased AST: This increase is mild and is not accompanied by an increased ALT. Hemolysis
or muscle damage are possible sources of the increased AST.
Tests of Renal Funcion 211
Urinalysis: The erythrocytes, heme, and protein are compatible with the presence of blood in
the urine. The urine is not adequately concentrated for a dehydrated patient, which may be
related to tubular cysfunction associated with obstructive nephropathy. This is not necessarily
a permanent change and the urine specific gravity should be re-evaluated after treatment.
Case Summary and Outcome
Ringo was found to have a urethral obstruction, and after he was sedated, caseous material

alert, but continued to pass bloody urine. Two days later his catheter was removed and he
continued to pass urine, so he was discharged.
obstructions in which imaging studies revealed renal changes, making it more likely that
permanent renal damage occurred with some degree of renal azotemia. Obstructed cats, on
the other hand, are more likely to present acutely and have less severe, if any, renal
parenchymal lesions. Because Ringo was unable to pass urine for a period of time, he
developed hyperkalemia, which was not noted in the two dogs as they were able to continue
to pass some urine, albeit with difficulty.
Ringo's relatively dilute urine in combination with the azotemia gives the impression of renal
azotemia. Like Gucci (Case 6), temporary tubular dysfunction may be present after relief of
the urinary obstruction. The passage of large amounts of relatively dilute urine characterizes
a period of post-obstructive diuresis after relief of urethral blockage (Nichols). Osmotic
diuresis from elevated urea nitrogen content of the urine may also contribute to post-
obstructive diuresis. This process is generally self-limiting, however large amounts of fluid can
be lost. The patient must be monitored carefully for electrolyte changes, specifically for

renal potassium loss. As the pressure is relieved and normal water and electrolyte balance is
re-established, urinary concentrating ability generally recovers. This is in contrast to the
apparently permanent loss of urinary concentrating ability noted in Gucci (Case 6).

Interpretation
CBC: Riff Raff has leucopenia with neutropenia and a degenerative left shift. It is not known if
Riff Raff had a left shift prior to the original surgical procedure. However, dogs with a left
shift prior to surgery for intestinal anastomoses are at increased risk for anastomotic leakage
and should be monitored carefully (Ralphs). Riff Raff also has a normocytic normochromic
anemia. The anemia may be nonregenerative, however a reticulocyte count is needed to
make this assessment. His anemia is more severe than is typically due to chronic disease or
 inflammation alone, and blood loss from the previous surgery may have contributed to the
thrombocytopenia can be explained by disseminated intravascular coagulation (see
coagulation data); however some degree of immune mediated destruction or impaired
and thrombocytopenia could be compatible with a primary bone marrow problem, however
these changes can be accounted for by extramarrow causes and a bone marrow aspirate is
not indicated at this time.

Increased BUN with normal creatinine: Several contributing factors are present to explain
 increased BUN with normal creatinine. This may represent early pre-renal azotemia, when
BUN increases because of slow tubular flow rates and increased time for passive reabsorption
secondary to septic shock. Hydration status is difficult to assess using laboratory data
because of the confounding effects of anemia and the possibility of protein losses from
hemorrhage, into the gastrointestinal tract, or into the abdominal effusion. BUN may also
increase if there has been bleeding into the gastrointestinal tract, or as a result of protein

concentrating ability.
Hypokalemia: This patient is likely to have been anorexic during the course of his illness, so
decreased intake could lower serum potassium concentration. Increased losses via the
gastrointestinal tract or into the abdominal effusion are also possible. Hypokalemia is more
likely to occur with poor intake if there are concurrent losses of the electrolyte
Obstructive cholestasis is unlikely given the normal ALP and GGT, however decreased liver
function (reference above) can also cause hyperbilirubinemia. Hemolysis is certainly possible
morphologic abnormalities suggesting a cause for hemolysis were noted (i.e. spherocytes,
Heinz bodies, etc). Although liver disease and hemolysis cannot be excluded as causes for
214 Manual of Veterinary Clinical Chemisty: A Case Sudy Approach
Mildly increased ALT and AST: Elevations in these enzymes suggest hepatocellular damage,
potential sources for liver damage, including sepsis (effects of bacterial toxins and poor
bacterial products with inflammatory mediators, trauma during surgery, and hypoxia secondary
to anemia. Primary liver disease cannot be ruled out, but is not required to account for these
enzyme elevations. The increased AST may refect muscle damage during surgery.
Coagulation profile: Mild prolongation of PT and APTT suggests the development of a
secondary hemostatic defect. In combination with the thrombocytopenia and increased fibrin
degradation products (indicating increased fibrinolysis), these findings are compatible with
disseminated intravascular coagulation, which may occur secondary to sepsis. Decreased liver
function can also cause these laboratory changes because of decreased hepatic production
of coagulation factors and impaired clearance of fibrin degradation products by the liver.
Adherence of platelets to damaged endothelium in the liver can cause thrombocytopenia.
Case Summary and Outcome
Abdominal fluid cytology revealed large numbers of degenerate neutrophils containing
intracellular bacteria. Riff Raff was taken to surgery, where it was discovered that two of the
four enterotomy sites had dehisced. One was repaired and the other required resection and
re-anastomosis. Riff Raff was managed with an open abdomen, fluids, antibiotics, and
parenteral nutrition. Unfortunately, 5 days later, Riff Raff suffered cardiopulmonary arrest
associated with an episode of vomiting. At necropsy, Riff Raff was noted to have diffuse,
fibrous and fibrinous peritonitis. Histologic examination of tissue revealed yeast compatible
with Candida species attached to the capsular surface of the liver, spleen, and intestine. Yeast
were subsequently cultured from these organs.
Although no urine was available to help interpret the increased BUN, multiple extra-renal
factors that could potentially influence the BUN were present in the clinical history. It is
helpful to compare Riff Raff with Sherpa (Chapter 5, Case 2), who also had a minor elevation
of BUN with modest elevations in liver enzymes. Despite these similarities, Riff Raff did not
have primary urinary tract disease, while Sherpa's diagnosis was transitional cell carcinoma
with hydronephrosis and significant renal pathology due to urinary outflow obstruction. Just
a minor increase in BUN with normal creatinine distinguish renal from extra-renal pathology
in all patients.

concentrating ability. lsosthenuria alone in a well hydrated patient can be a normal finding.
Hypercalcemia with hypophosphatemia: Because normal equine kidneys excrete large
quantities of calcium, decreased glomerular filtration rate can result in hypercalcemia, especially
if dietary calcium is high. This is in contrast to the variable calcium measurements that
characterize renal failure in the dog and cat. Hypophosphatemia is often described in horses
with renal failure and may occur secondary to the hypercalcemia because of mass action. This is
in contrast to the hyperphosphatemia that often accompanies decreased GFR in other species.
PTH levels in horses with renal disease are reported to be suppressed (Brobstt) or variable

Hyperproteinemia: Given that the serum albumin and globulins are both within reference

because of low renal production of erythropoietin and the effect of uremic toxins on
erythropoiesis. Poor nutritional status may also exacerbate these anemias. If leukocyte and
platelet numbers are adequate, a bone marrow evaluation is not indicated because a
peripheral etiology for the anemia is present.

Hyperphosphatemia and normal calcium: The most likely cause of hyperphosphatemia in
this patient is decreased glomerular filtration rate, regardless of whether the decreased

in renal failure may have high, normal, or low serum calcium levels, and ionized calcium levels
may not correlate with total calcium levels. lonized calcium measurements should be

characterized by renal vasoconstriction and decreased glomerular filtration rate, polydipsia
and polyuria because of increased angiotensin ll, and refractoriness to vasopressin.
Correction of potassium depletion may reverse some of these changes and improve urinary
concentrating ability.
Decreased HcO3: This indicates acidemia, which is frequently observed in patients with
renal failure. Often this change is associated with increased anion gap due to the presence of

Abnormal lipoprotein lipase function related to inadlequate amounts of its co-factor, heparan

Increased amylase: Decreased glomerular filtration rate will increase amylase in the absence
of pancreatic disease. Amylase is a poor indicator of pancreatic pathology in cats.

also characterize uremia and may contribute to hemorrhage. Indices and reticulocyte counts
are not available to assess the erythropoietic response. It is anticipated that it would take 3-5
days before a significant reticulocytosis would be detected in response to hemorrhage. A
regenerative response may be blunted due continued loss of iron with external hemorrhage
and impaired erythropoietin release by the damaged kidneys.

however it may occur in association with protein-losing enteropathy, decreased liver function,
in the course of disease could be compatible with a pre-existing liver function problem such
as a portocaval shunt, especially in a high risk breed such as the Yorkshire terrier. Serum bile
acid measurement should eventually be considered in this patient. Decreased liver function
would certainly interfere with Joe's ability to increase albumin synthesis in compensation for
increased renal or gastrointestinal losses.
Urinalysis: As noted above, Joe is isosthenuric. The glucosuria could indicate renal tubular
dysfunction, or the possibility that the hyperglycemia previously exceeded the tubular
maximum for reabsorption of 180-200 mg/dl. The proteinuria may be partially related to the
presence of blood in the urine, lower urinary tract disease, or glomerular lesions. Dipstick
protein measurements are generally more sensitive to albumin than globulins, and this leve
of proteinuria is considered significant in dilute urine. A urine protein:creatinine ratio could
be performed to quantify the proteinuria, but is only recommended if lower urinary tract
sources of protein are ruled out.
Case Summary and Outcome
Joe was admitted to the hospital and activated charcoal was administered to prevent further
absorption of any remaining ibuprofen. He also was treated with intravenous fluids, gastro-
protectants, antiemetics, total parenteral nutrition, and antibiotics because of the concern
that bacterial translocation may occur with compromised intestines. Despite this therapy, Joe
vomited blood several times and began to have episodes of diarrhea containing digested
blood. A blood transfusion and albumin were given to compensate for his gastrointestinal
blood loss. After six days of therapy, he showed signs of fluid overload and was treated with
hypertension, Joe's blood pressure was normal throughout his hospitalization. His azotemia

cases of renal failure are diagnosed late in the course of disease (see Chapter 5, Cases 9 and
10), and the initiating causes are never discovered. Differentiation of acute from chronic renal
failure can be difficult, and the occurrence of acute exacerbations of more chronic processes
can complicate the distinction. Acute presentation, especially with a history of potential
ischemia or toxin exposure, implies acute renal failure, however development of clinical signs
may be subtle in chronic renal failure, and acute decompensation of chronic renal disease
may give the clinical impression of recent onset. Patients with chronic renal failure are more

chronic. Patients with acute renal failure may be more likely to present with oliguria/anuria
and therefore hyperkalemia (Vaden). However, terminal chronic renal failure can be present
with decreased urine production and potassium retention as seen in Margarite (Case 9).
Tests of Renal Funcion 223
Acute post-renal azotemia can also be associated with hyperkalemia, such as in cats with
urinary obstruction (Ringo, Chapter 5, Case 7). Joe's serum potassium was low despite acute
with acute renal failure because there has been less time for physiologic adaptation to
decreased renal function.
The presence of non-regenerative anemia is more common in chronic renal failure, however
the above cases illustrate the limitation of this data for prediction of acute versus chronic
renal disease. The horse with chronic renal failure (Margarite, Case 9) was not anemic. Ringo,
the cat with chronic renal failure was moderately anemic. Joe developed anemia along with
his renal failure, because of gastrointestinal hemorrhage associated with non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory toxicity. Blood loss anemias are usually regenerative, however Joe's
erythropoietic response may have been limited by the presence of renal disease. Indices
were not available to judge Joe's response to the blood loss. Often the clinician must rely on
the combination of history, clinical signs, and laboratory data to determine the likelihood of
acute or chronic renal failure

Interpretation
CBC: Pugsley has a mild neutrophilic leukocytosis which could be compatible with mild
inflammation.
There is a mild microcytic, normochromic anemia. Causes of microcytosis in dogs are limited
and include breed characteristic (Japanese breeds such as Akitas, Chows or Shar Peis), iron
deficiency, and portosystemic vascular anomolies. An iron panel could be performed to
clarify Pugsley's iron status, however Pugsley has other data compatible with a portosystemic
shunt (hypoglycemia, low BUN, hypoalbuminemia, mild elevations of liver enzymes). If
Pugsley is eating a standard commercial dog food, he is unlikely to have a dietary deficiency
of iron. No obvious chronic blood loss has been noted by the owner. Pugsley should be
checked for evidence of parasites; it would be more cost effective to perform a fecal
flotation and to check for fleas and ticks than to run an iron panel at this time. In addition,

present on this blood film.
The mild thrombocytopenia is of questionable clinical significance at this time. Although no
platelet clumping was reported, a repeat CBC should be considered to rule out artifactual

that platelet function and other hemostatic parameters are normal. Because there is evidence
of decreased liver function on the serum biochemical profile, a coagulation profile should be

Tests of Renal Funcion

Because of the neutrophilic leukocytosis, sepsis may be considered as a cause for
hypoglycemia, however it is unlikely in a dog with no apparent clinical signs. Neoplasia is also
unlikely in a young dog, and there is no history of starvation or poor body condition.
Decreased BUN and creatinine: Low BUN may be attributed to poor liver function
secondary to the presence of a portosystemic shunt. Given the low urine specific gravity, high
tubular flow rates in the kidney with decreased time for reabsorption of urea may contribute
to low BUN in this case. Polyuria and polydipsia were not described in the clinical history, but
are frequently associated with poor liver function in dogs because of a combination of
stimulation of thirst centers, and/or increased endogenous cortisol levels associated with
increased production or decreased degradation of corticosteroids. Low muscle mass in a
young, small breed dog could also conceivably contribute to low creatinine. Some patients
with portosystemic shunts grow poorly and are small compared to litter mates.
Hypoproteinemia with hypoalbuminemia: Hypoalbuminemia can be due to decreased
production or increased losses. Because the liver is the site of albumin production, poor liver
function can cause hypoalbuminemia. In some cases, albumin production may be low
because of lack of substrate (starvation/malnutrition, unlikely in this case because of lack of
supporting clinical data), or because the liver downregulates albumin production as part of
the acute phase response (the neutrophilic leukocytosis suggests some degree of
inflammation). Most causes of increased protein losses result in the loss of both albumin and
globulins (hemorrhage, gastrointestinal losses, dermal or third space protein losses). Because
of the microcytic anemia, there is some question of chronic blood loss, however hemorrhage
should be associated with loss of both albumin and globulin proteins. Exclusive loss of
albumin causing hypoalbuminemia occurs via the glomerulus, however proteinuria was not
noted on the urinalysis. Because the urine was relatively dilute, a urine protein:creatinine ratio
could be performed as a more sensitive indicator of proteinuria. Based on all of Pugsley's
laboratory results, evaluation of liver function by performing fasted and post-prandial bile
acids measurements is a better choice to determine the cause of hypoalbuminemia.
Low anion gap: The anion gap is an indicator of unmeasured anions, most of which are
negatively charged plasma proteins. As a result, hypoproteinemia causes a decrease in anion
gap
Mild increase in ALP: Increases in ALP are nonspecific in dogs and may be related to a
variety of extrahepatic causes, drug or hormone effects, or cholestasis. Significant cholestatic
disease is often accompanied by an increase in GGT or bilirubin, which are not seen here.
Mild liver enzyme elevations are often described in association with portosystemic shunts and
is the most likely cause in this case. Increased ALP is seen with bone formation in young,

Mild increase in ALT and AST: These changes are mild and indicate hepatocellular damage.

function cannot be ruled out. Liver failure may also interfere with renal concentrating ability in
the absence of renal pathology. Polyuria may be seen in animals with portosystemic shunts.
Case Summary and Outcome
Both fasted and post-prandial serum bile acid concentrations were elevated.
Ultrasonagraphic evaluation of Pugsley's abdomen showed a small liver and a large
extrahepatic portosystemic shunt. The shunt was corrected by cellophane banding. He was
discharged and recovered well at home. Pugleys' case demonstrates how a primary liver
disease can influence renal variables, including BUN, creatinine, and urine specific gravity.
Please see Chapter 2, Case 12 (Binar) and Chapter 3, Case 7 (Yap Yap) for more complete
discussions of the pathophysiology of portosytemic shunts.

filtration rate, regardless of whether the decreased glomerular filtration rate is due to pre-
renal, renal, or post-renal causes. Small animal patients in renal failure may have high, normal,
or low serum calcium levels, and ionized calcium levels may not correlate with total calcium
levels as they often do in healthy animals
Hyponatremia and hypochloremia: Increased renal losses of electrolytes are possible
because patients in renal failure may have abnormalities of renal tubular handling of sodium
and chloride. Measurement of urinary fractional excretion of sodium and chloride could be
performed to evaluate renal losses of electrolytes. The change in serum chloride is dispropor-
tionately greater than that of sodium. This could be attributed to vomiting of gastric contents
with high concentrations of chloride, however disproportionate changes in chloride can also
occur with acid/base abnormalities. In general, HCO3 and chloride have an inverse
relationship. This is not the case here, possibly because alkalemia due to loss of hydrogen
and chloride from vomiting is counterbalanced by uremic acidosis. This is compatible with a
mixed acid/base disorcler. In many cases in which hyponatremia and hypochloremia are due

Case Summary and Outcome
Because of the presence of the mass in the area of the left kidney, an abdominal ultrasound
was performed. The imaging study revealed hydronephrosis, hydroureter, and pyelectasia
suggestive for pyelonephritis. Two bacterial species were isolated from urine cultures. Note
that the urine sediment examination was unremarkable; this may occur in patients with
pyelonephritis due to minimal or absent urine flow from the affected kidney. Therefore,

Leukogram: Sally has a mild mature neutrophilic leukocytosis and lymphopenia on Day 1,
which is compatible with a stress/corticosteroid leukogram. Mild inflammation cannot be
ruled out, however there are no toxic changes or a left shift to corroborate this
interpretation. The lymphopenia on Day 9 is also likely attributable to corticosteroid effects;
the mature neutrophilia may not be a persistent finding with chronic stress.

Sally may need to have further diagnostic evalvation to determine if underlying cardliopul-
monary disease contributed to her collapse. Alternatively, compressive lesions of the kidney
parenchyma (cysts and tumors) can cause renal hypoxia and increased erythropoietin
production, and there is evidence of renal azotemia in this case. Much less likely is ectopic
production of erythropoietin by an extra-renal tumor or autonomous proliferation of erythroid
precursors resulting from polycythemia vera. Evaluation of the patient for cardiopulmonary

Mechanisms for thrombocytopenia include decreased production and increased destruction.
The hematemesis and melena suggest hemorrhage and increased consumption of platelets.

bone marrow disorder will need to be evaluated.
Serum Biochemical Profile Day 1:
Hypoglycemia: In patients with no clinical signs of hypoglycemia, artifactual hypoglycemia
due to processing errors should be ruled out by measuring glucose on a freshly collected
sample with prompt separation of serum from cells. In this case, the hypoglycemia was
jo asneo Aey!l e s! sisdas asdelloo s,bop ayt ot patnguuos aaey Keu pue paljaa
hypoglycemia in this case because of the clinical signs indicating breakdown of the intestinal
mucosa. However, abnormalities in the leukogram are not consistent with sepsis at this time.
Liver failure can impair hepatic gluconeogenesis, however other supportive data are lacking,
such as low BUN, hypocholesterolemia, or prolonged coagulation times. Serum bile acids
could be performed to assess liver function. Hypoglycemia due to the production of insulin
or insulin-like substances by tumors is possible in a middle-aged dog, but is rare.
Azotemia: The azotemia in combination with isosthenuria suggests renal failure, however a
pre-renal component is also likely due to dehydration (polycythemia) and poor tissue
perfusion (lack of palpable pulses on presentation). Gastrointestinal hemorrhage can further
elevate the BUN, as seen with Joe, (Chapter 5, Case 11). Glucosuria in a patient with norma
to low blood glucose is compatible with renal tubular dysfunction. Contamination of the
sample by oxidants causing false positive results on the urine dipstick should be ruled out.

Hyponatremia and hypochloremia: Increased losses ot sodium and chloride may occur via

hypochloremia may be exacerbated if fluid losses are replaced by drinking water or by
than the hyponatremia, which is mild and of questionable clinical significance. When changes
in chloride are greater than changes in sodium, disproportionate losses of chloride such as
chronic vomiting or an acid/base imbalance are suspected. Other causes of hyponatremia
and hypochloremia such as decreased dietary intake of sodium and chloride are rarely an
issue in small animal patients on commercial diets
Increased anion gap and normal Hco3: Accumulation of unmeasured anions increases the
suggests uremic acidosis. Hypochloremia is generally associated with alkalosis, but the HCO3
is normal. A mixed acid/base disorder is possible here, and a blood gas analysis would
facilitate interpretation of these changes.
Increased ALT and AST: Elevation of AST is severe and could reflect camage to muscle,
hepatocytes, and/or erythrocytes. Increases in ALT similarly reflect damage to muscle and
hepatocytes. A creatine kinase level could be determined to support a myocyte origin for these

hypoxia are likely causes for the damage, both liver and muscle could be affected.

CBC and Serum Biochemical Profile Day 9:
Sally was treated with intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and gastroprotectants for presumptive
heat stroke. Many of the differences from day 1 to day 9 reflect the fluid therapy. The PCV,
total protein and albumin are now decreased, compatible with restoration of vascular volume
in the face of whole blood loss. The continued thrombocytopenia may reflect ongoing

BUN, creatinine, and phosphorus values have improved but have not normalized, indicating
ongoing renal dysfunction. Na and Cl are back within the normal range. K is mildly
decreased, and this needs to be monitored so that K depletion secondary to fluid therapy
and diuresis does not occur.
On day 9, ALT and AST have decreased, which could indicate some resolution of tissue
damage. Because AST has a shorter half life than ALT, this marked fall in AST probably
There is now evidence of cholestasis, likely secondary to hepatocellular swelling, as indicated

Sally responded well and became brighter with resolution of the vomiting and melena, but

management with fluid therapy at home (her owner was a nurse). She presented for acute
blindness three days later and was found to have severe hypertension and bilateral retinal

hypertension, fluid therapy, and vascular lesions from the heat stroke. She was treated with
antihypertensive medications and her fluid rate was reduced. Her azotemia was persistent
and fluid therapy was to continue for several more weeks in the hopes that some tubular
function would recover.
The presence of glucosuria with normoglycemia suggests tubular dysfunction and is 
compatible with tubular necrosis. This is more common with acute processes, although
laboratory data cannot always distinguish acute from chronic renal failure (see discussion of
Joe, Case 11). Sally's clinical history indicates high potential for ischemic insult to the kidney:
renal damage in heatstroke is attributed to direct thermal injury to cells, reduced visceral
perfusion as blood is shunted peripherally for heat dissipation, or microvascular thrombosis
Opie (Case 13), the ultimate outcome of Sally's renal disease may take time to determine.

Case 15 - Level 3
"Elvira" is an 8-year-old spayed female German Shepherd dog presenting with a 7 day
history of anorexia and lethargy, during which time she has lost 12 pounds of body weight.
The owner had taken Elvira to his parents' farm, where he thinks she may have eaten some
garbage. Elvira has been vomiting intermittently, but is drinking water. On physical
examination, Elvira was dehydrated and had icteric sclera and mildly enlarged submandibular
lymph nodes. Her abdomen was tender on palpation and she had a slightly enlarged spleen.

Spleen aspirate: Smears are hemodiluted with proportional numbers of leukocytes
There is a heterogeneous population of lymphocytes.
Interpretation
CBC: The numerical data is unremarkable. The presence of acanthocytes can be associated
with liver disease, which is supported by the clinical chemistry data. The significance of small
numbers of schistocytes is unclear, however they may reflect vascular lesions, including some
splenomegaly and the age and breed of the dog: however there are many other potentia.
causes for enlargement ot the spleen.
Serum Biochemical Profile
Azotemia: Urinalysis data is not available, theretore the potential for renal azotemia is
difficult to evaluate. Given the dehydration, pre-renal factors certainly contribute to the
elevated BUN and creatinine
Mildly increased total protein and hyperglobulinemia: These changes may be due to
dehydration, however they also could be compatible with either antigenic stimulation or
indication of inflammatory disease on the CBC at this time. Less likely is the potential for a
monoclonal gammopathy, signaling possible lymphoid malignancy.
and are unlikely to be associated with clinical signs at this time. Decreased intake is rarely a
factor contributing to low sodium and chloride. These electrolytes may be diluted if there is
excessive retention of free water, however, given the dehydration, this is an unlikely
mechanism for the alterations. In this case, increased losses by gastrointestinal or renal routes
are most likely. Urinary fractional excretion of sodium and chloride could be performed to
quantify renal losses of electrolytes, which should be low under these circumstances if the
inappropriate and consistent with renal disease. Hypoadrenocorticism is less likely given the
hypokalemia. Third space and cutaneous losses should also be considered if compatible with
clinical signs.
Hypokalemia: In contrast to sodium and chloride, low intake can contribute to the
development of hypokalemia, especially in combination with increased losses. Potassium
could be lost via the same routes as sodium and chloride.
the liver enzymes suggest liver disease; specifically the increased ALP and GGT are
compatible with cholestasis. Decreased hepatocellular uptake can also be associated with
decreased liver function of any cause, and sepsis can result in diminished hepatocellular
uptake of bilirubin. Sepsis is unlikely in this patient and generally can only account for
relatively modest elevations in bilirubin.
Increased ALP and GGT: As noted above, increased ALP and GGT with hyperbilirubinemia
indicate cholestasis, however there are numerous extrahepatic factors and other liver
diseases which can increase ALP and GGT (see Chapter 2 for more details).
Tests of Renal Funcion 235
Increased ALT and AST: Elevations in these enzymes often indicate hepatocellular damage,
however they indicate nothing specific about the etiology of the damage, nor the potential
reversibility of the liver disease.

Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a thickened spleen with nodules (see above cytology).
however the liver and pancreas were within normal limits. Elvira was treated with fluids and
nutritional support, after which the azotemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and liver enzyme elevations

One week after dlischarge from the hospital, Elvira's bilirubin was down to 4.7, however her ALT
and ALP were persistently elevated and she was still azotemic. At this time, nephropathy was

liver enzymes had normalized. At this time, Leptospirosis titers were performed.

Elvira was treated for Leptospirosis with appropriate antibiotics. Over the next year, she
developed clinical signs and laboratory abnormalities characteristic of chronic renal failure,
however she had good quality of life at home with daily administration of fluids and other
supportive management. Sixteen months after her initial presentation, she presented in oliguric
renalfailureandwaseuthanized
At the time of the first hospitalization, Elvira's azotemia was presumed to be pre-renal and
 appropriate interpretation of BUN and creatinine. Leptospirosis should be a consideration in any
dog with the combination of renal azotemia and evidence of liver disease, especially if there is a
history of exposure to livestock. This case should be compared with Hilda (Chapter 2, Case 18),
another case of leptospirosis with laboratory evidence of renal compromise and liver disease.
Diagnosis in Hilda's case was further complicated by her clinical history of eating pastries,
cheese cake, and butter, however her laboratory work and her presentation with clinical signs of
dehydration and poorly concentrated urine prompted immedliate evaluation for causes of renal
azotemia. Diagnosis in both of these cases was made using documentation of single markedly
elevated titers for Leptospira spp. in the presence of compatible clinical signs. Polymerase chain
reaction testing of urine is also available. While the negative predlictive value of these titers
appears to be high, some clinically normal dogs may have positive titers (Harkin, Harkin).

Elevations in one or more of the liver enzymes is observed in over 90% of cases of hyperthy
roidism in cats (Broussard). Liver enzyme elevations are reversible with control of thyroid
disease. Further work-up for primary liver cisease is not recommended at this time because
extra-hepatic factors can account for enzyme changes. Liver enzyme levels below the reference
range (ALT) are not considered diagnostically significant and should not be over-interpreted
238 Mamual of Veterinary Clinical Chemisty: A Case Sudy Approach
Urinalysis: Bacteriuria, pyuria, and proteinuria indicate a urinary tract infection. Bacterial
culture and sensitivity should be considered. Pyelonephritis could cause renal failure, and
sepsis may also be associated with elevated liver enzymes (see Opie, Chapter 5, Case 13,
and Riff Raff, Chapter 5, Case 8) that are also present in this patient.
Case Summary and Outcome
Thyroid hormone testing at a reference laboratory revealed hyperthyroidism (T4 = 7.5 μg/dl,
reference interval = 1.2-5.2). In-house ELISA assays for T4 are available, but may correlate
poorly with standard radio-immunoassay methods (Lurye). Tinker was also suspected to have
some degree of decreased renal function. Azotemia is commonly described in hyperthyroid
cats (Broussard), although the mechanisms are not clear. Some cats have concurrent renal
disease, while in other patients, the azotemia resolves with successful control of excess
thyroid hormone concentration. Increased protein catabolism and pre-renal factors related to
dehydration or associated cardiovascular disease also have been suggested as mechanisms
underlying the azotemia. Both hyperthyroidism and hypokalemia may have contributed to
hormone has been implicated in the development of dilute urine because of increased renal
medullary blood flow and inadequate medullary solute concentration. However, one study of
202 hyperthyroid cats documented low urine specific gravity in only 3% of cases (Broussard).
Idlentification of concurrent renal disease in hyperthyroid cats is important for several reasons.
with diagnosis of hyperthyroidism (Tomsa, McLoughlin). Potential mechanisms for this include
low binding of thyroid hormone to carrier proteins, low concentration or affinity of carrier
treatment of hyperthyroidism in older cats may exacerbate underlying renal disease, possibly
because of reduction in GFR (DiBartola). Based on this data, it is recommended that
reversible medical treatment with methimazole be instituted prior to surgery or radlioactive
permanent correction of hyperthyroidism.
Tinker was treated with antibiotics for a urinary tract infection and with methimazole, which
works by preventing incorporation of iodine into the tyrosine residues of thyroglobulin.
Tinker was still isosthenuric, however her renal disease did not appear to have progressed
after control of the thyroid disease.
Ninety days into her treatment, Tinker presented for lethargy and the following laboratory

Serum Biochemical Profile
Azotemia: Azotemia should be categorized as pre-renal, renal, or post-renal. The minimally
concentrated urine in the face of severe dehydration supports renal failure. There is no
evidence of post-renal disease such as fluid in the abdomen or a large, firm bladder. Because
the patient is significantly dehydrated, there is likely pre-renal azotemia in addition to rena
azotemla
Hyperphosphatemia, hypermagnesemia, and normal calcium: The most likely cause of hyper-
regardless of whether the decreased glomerular filtration rate is due to pre-renal, renal, or post-
renal causes. Small animal patients in renal failure may have high, normal, or low serum calcium
levels, and ionized calcium levels may not correlate with total calcium levels
Increased total protein and albumin: Increases these analytes are most likely due to
dehydration.
Hyponatremia and hypochloremia: Hyponatremia is rarely due to dietary deficiency of
 sodium, and dilution because of free water is unlikely given clinical dehydration and hyperal-
buminemia. Therefore, excessive loss of sodium is the probable cause for the hyponatremia.
While sodium may be lost via multiple routes including gastrointestinal, dermal, third space,

with renal disease may have low, normal, or high serum sodium. Chloride often changes in
proportion to sodium, however in this case there is a disproportionate decrease in chloride
compared to sodium. This may be due to loss in vomitus. However the increased anion gap
and low normal HCO3 suggest the possibility of an acid/base disturbance, which could also
cause a disproportionate change in chloride.
Increased anion gap: Hyperproteinemia and dehydration can increase the anion gap, as can

lactic acidosis. In general, chloride and HCO3 vary inversely. In this case the combination of
hypochloremia and borderline acidosis (low HCO3) suggest the possibility of a mixed
acid/base disorder. Vomiting of gastric contents could contribute to alkalemia. Alkalemia
itself can increase the anion gap because of loss of protons from plasma proteins resulting in
increased production of lactic acid. Complete characterization of the acid/base status of this
patient requires blood gas analysis. Correction of the fluid deficits and treatment of the renal
disease should improve the acid/base status, regardless of the exact cause.
Hypercholesterolemia: Increases in cholesterol have been described in dogs with glomerular
nephrotic syndrome may be increased hepatic synthesis, and these patients often have an

Increased Creatine kinase: This is evidence for muscle degeneration or necrosis. Muscle
breakdown associated with anorexia in cats can elevate serum CK (Fascetti). CK levels
Urinalysis: Proteinuria of 2+ in dilute urine with an inactive sediment is compatible with
disease in this case to account for the protein in the urine. A urine protein:creatinine ratio is
recommended to further evaluate urinary protein losses. It is worthwhile noting that significant
glomerular protein loss is not always associated with hypoalbuminemia because of the
capacity of a healthy liver for compensatory upregulate of albumin production. Dehydration

concentration of the abdominal fluid are compatible with uroabdomen, a cause of post-renal
azotemia. Pre-renal factors may also contribute to the azotemia. Accumulation of fluid in the
abdomen may cause intravascular volume contraction and lower the glomerular filtration
rate. Dehydration because of poor nursing also adds to the pre-renal azotemia.
Hyperphosphatemia: The most likely cause for the hyperphosphatemia in this case is

contraction of the intravascular fluid volume leads to stimulation of the renin-angiotensin
system, which will tend to conserve sodium and water. In addition, antidiuretic hormone will
stimulate free water retention and thirst, which will have a dilutional effect on the remaining
electrolytes in the circulation.
Hyperkalemia: When the body cannot eliminate urine, potassium will be retained. This may
occur with post-renal azotemia or in the anuric/oliguric phase of renal failure. This is in
contrast to the polyuric phase of renal failure, in which increased tubular flow rates promote
potassium wasting, resulting from decreased time for reabsorption. As has been noted for
other cases with electrolyte changes of hyponatremia, hypochloremia, and hyperkalemia,
hypoadrenocorticism is a differential diagnosis, however this is very unlikely in this patient

Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: Elevations in serum glucose in the horse are most often caused by
endogenous catecholamines and glucocorticoids release secondary to excitement or stress.
Leukogram findings are not specific for either of these effects. Diabetes mellitus is rare in
domestic large animal species. Hyperadrenocorticism in the horse may predispose to
development of hyperglycemia, related to insulin resistance.
Azotemia and Urinalysis: Azotemia in conjunction with concentrated urine indicates pre-
renal azotemia. Dehydration secondary to colic will contribute to pre-renal azotemia. Poor
urine specific gravity at this time supports pre-renal azotemia, the use of nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatories at high doses or in combination with other nephrotoxic drugs or dehydration
can cause kidney damage and needs to be monitored (see Joe, Chapter 5, Case 11, and
Calvin, Chapter 2, Case 20).
Hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia: The most likely cause for the hyperphosphatemia in
minemia. Colic is often associated with decreases in both total and ionized calcium, though
the mechanism is still uncertain. Calcium wasting in the urine did not appear to contribute to
the hypocalcemia in horses with colic (Toribio). Acute renal failure in horses also can be
failure may be associated with hypercalcemia because the large amounts of calcium that are
normally excreted in the urine can no longer be eliminated by this route. Low serum ionized
calcium levels can be caused by low magnesium states due to inadequate action of
parathyroid hormone. lonized calcium levels can be performed to further evaluate Faith's
calcium status.
Hypomagnesemia: Like calcium, magnesium is protein bound and may decrease secondary
to hypoproteinemia. Prolonged anorexia and excess urinary elimination may also be factors.
lonized magnesium may be low in horses with colic (Toribio).
248  Manual of Veterinary Clinical Chemisty: A Case Study Aproach
Hypoproteinemia with hypoalbuminemia: Selective hypoalbuminemia is most often the result
of either decreased production (inadequate liver function, starvation) or increased losses via
glomerular lesions. Most other causes of increased protein loss, such as cutaneous, gastroin-
testinal, or third space losses, result in a deficit of both globulins and albumin. Based on the
clinical history, gastrointestinal losses of protein are most likely in this case. It is likely that Faith
actually has increased production of acute phase reactants and/or immunoglobulins secondary

cause of these electrolyte abnormalities. Sweating from pain associated with laminitis or colic is
another possible route for loss of sodium and chloride. If isotonic fluid losses are replaced by
drinking water, hyponatremia and hypochloremia can result. Lipemia can cause artifactually
lower electrolyte values, depending on the methodology used to measure these analytes. If an
diluted as part of the assay, artifactual lowering of electrolyte concentrations may be observed
with severe lipemia. This occurs with analyzers such as the Hitachi 911. With direct
lipemic interference with measurement of electrolyte concentrations would not be anticipated.
If sodium and chloride are both decreased in an obviously lactescent sample, another
methodology should be used to confirm concentrations of these electrolytes.
Increased anion gap: This value reflects an accumulation of unmeasured anions, which could
compatible with acidosis, however here the HCO3 is still at the lower end of the reference
range.
Hyperbilirubinemia: The most likely cause of hyperbilirubinemia in a sick horse is anorexia.
Given the normal PCV, hemolysis is unlikely. Cholestasis is possible given the increased liver
enzymes.
Increased ALP and GGT: In an adult horse, increased GGT is evidence for liver damage and
efficiently eliminated in the urine. ALP is less liver specific than GGT and may be slightly less
sensitive in the horse. These enzyme elevations are not specific as to the etiology of the liver
insult. The combination of lipemia and elevated liver enzymes in a recently anorexic obese pony
Increased AST and CK: AST is present in multiple tissues and elevations can be difficult to
origin, yet the concurrent increase in CK indicates that muscle camage has occurred and may
be responsible for some of the increase in AST. Like ALP and GGT, elevations in AST are not
specific as to the etiology of the liver damage. Note that none of these enzymes are liver

Case Summary and Outcome
Faith was treated with intravenous fluids and dextrose, antibiotics, and analgesics (avoiding
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories). She remained stable overnight, but began to deteriorate,
becoming increasingly painful and eventually showing signs of endotoxemia. Ultimately, Faith
was euthanized for humane reasons because of her lack of response to therapy. Clinicians felt
that the gastrointestinal lesions might have been related to the use of non-steroidal anti-
inflammatories used to treat the initial laminitis. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are
thought to induce injury by direct topical efects and inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis that
contributes to maintenance of mucosal barrier in the gastrointestinal system (Tomlinson).

Interpretation
CBC: Forsythia has leucopenia with neutropenia and lymphopenia. Hyperfibrinoginemia and
neutrophilia or a left shift. Sepsis and consumption of neutrophils may contribute to the
neutropenia. Alternatively, in combination with the nonregenerative anemia, a primary bone
marrow disease could be considered. The clinical history and biochemistry data are
compatible with renal disease, which could explain a nonregenerative anemia in the absence
of marrow pathology. Lymphopenia may indicate corticosteroid effects, or potentially lysis
secondary to a viral infection.
Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: Stress and corticosteroid effects can result in hyperglycemia in llamas, which
appear to have poor insulin responses (Cebra). The lymphopenia is also compatible with
corticosteroid effects. The combination of hyperglycemia and glucosuria is suggestive for
diabetes mellitus, but may also result from transient increases in blood glucose over the
transport maximum in the kidney. Persistent hyperglycemia with or without ketonemia is
needed for a diagnosis of diabetes.
Severe azotemia: In combination with the isosthenuria and oral lesions, renal disease is the
likely cause of the azotemia, although pre-renal factors may exacerbate the increases in BUN
and creatinine. The oral lesions are compatible with uremia. Given the history of straining and
rectal prolapse, urinary obstruction should be ruled out.
Hypocalcemia: This abnormality may related to the hypoalbuminemia, however a
quantitative relationship between the two values cannot be cdetermined. Increased urinary
losses of calcium associated with renal disease also could contribute to hypocalcemia. While
Tests of Renal Funcion

not present in this patient, decreases in calcium in conjunction with hyperphosphatemia have
been described in llamas with decreased glomerular filtration rate secondary to urethral
obstruction (Gerros).
Hypermagnesemia: Increased magnesium is associated with decreased glomerular filtration
rate.
Hypoalbuminemia: Proteinuria suggests the potential for renal protein loss, however the
presence of leukocytes, bacteria, and erythrocytes in the urine indlicates that lower urinary tract
disease could explain the proteinuria. Urine protein:creatinine ratios should be measured after
successful treatment of any urinary tract infection. Although the owners do not report diarrhea,
fecal staining of her perineum suggests that gastrointestinal losses of protein are possible.

Globulin loss may be masked by increased production due to inflammation. Forsythia's history
hypoalbuminemia.
Hypochloremia with normal serum sodium: Gastrointestinal seq uestration and salivary losses
of chloride will decrease serum chloride. Acid/base abnormalities are also associated with
changes in chloride that are disproportionate to sodium, however chloride usually varies
inversely with HCO3, which is not the case in this patient. When chloride and HCO3 change in
the same direction, a mixed acid/base disorder is suspected, and arterial blood gases should be
evaluated for more complete characterization of the process. Renal losses of chloride can be
quantifed by measuring urinary fractional excretion, and normal values are available in the
literature(Garry).
associated with polyuric renal failure because increased tubular flow rates decrease
reabsorption of potassium. Inability to eliminate urine in oliguric/anuric renal failure or with
urinary outflow obstruction more often causes retention of potassium and hyperkalemia.

unmeasured anions, such as uremic acids. The hyperglycemia and glucosuria could be
compatible with diabetes mellitus, and ketoacids also can increase the anion gap. In this case
the urine did not contain ketones, and the hyperglycemia could be attributable to stress
Increased GGT, AST, and CK: Elevated serum GGT may indicate hepatic necrosis or cholestatic
when there are increased caloric demands such as with pregnancy or lactation (Tornquist). Both
liver and muscle damage can increase AST. Based on the increased CK, at least of portion of
the elevation in AST is from muscle. Muscle damage may be related to administration of
intramuscular injections or any episodes of recumbency.
Case Summary and Outcome
Based on a poor long-term prognosis, Forsythia was humanely euthanized. At necropsy, only
evidence of liver necrosis or hepatic lipidosis. Erythroid hypoplasia was apparent in the marrow,
consistent with chronic renal disease as a cause for the anemia. Proteinaceous casts were founc
in the renal tubules, some of which contained neutrophils. Glomerular adhesions and sclerosis
with dliffuse interstitial fibrosis were considered compatible with glomerulonephritis. As is
usually the case, the cause of the lesion could not be determined, however the pattern was

support protein losing nephropathy as a contributing factor to the hypoalbuminemia.
Immune-complex deposition is a common cause of glomerulonephritis in the horse, and
subclinical disease may be present in horses as an incidental finding at necropsy (Slauson).
Other times, glomerulonephritis culminates in the development of chronic renal failure,
although not all patients with glomerulonephritis are azotemic at presentation (Van Biervliet). It
is also possible for patients with glomerulonephritis to present with azotemia and concentrated
urine. In the absence of pre-renal azotemia, this may be explained as the result of glomerulo-
tubular imbalance in which glomerular filtration decreases to below 75% of normal, but tubular
function is maintained (Grant).

This case may be compared with Joe (Case 11), in which acute renal damage was caused by
ibuprofen toxicity. Joe appears to have milder disease and an earlier intervention than
Brianna, despite the fact that both patients were exposed to nephrotoxic substances. Joe's
laboratory work is also complicated by the effects of gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Sally (Case
14) suffered from acute renal damage secondary to heatstroke, and her serum biochemical
profile is similar to Brianna's, however the degree of hyperphosphatemia is not as
pronounced. Note that the patients presenting with acute renal disease are not anemic, while
patients with more chronic renal disease often have non-regenerative anemia (Tramp, Case

More sensitive testing of liver function could include measurement of serum bile acids or
blood ammonia, but is not necessary in this case unless other clinical signs suggestive for
liver failure develop. In this case, osmotic diuresis caused by the glucosuria causes the
decreasing time for reabsorption of urea. This leads to increased renal losses of urea and
diabetes. Decreased creatinine is not clinically significant, and is difficult to confirm because
of the effects of non-creatinine chromagens at low creatinine concentrations and because the
lower end of the reference range in most species is near the limit of analytical sensitivity of
the assay. Glucocorticoid administration has been reported to lower serum creatinine in
Hyponatremia and hypochloremia: Lipemia can cause artifactually lower electrolyte values,
depending on the methodology used to measure these analytes. lf an analyzer employs
indirect potentiometry with ion specific electrodes in which the sample is diluted as part of
the assay, artifactual lowering of electrolyte concentrations may be observed with severe
sample dilution, lipemic interference with measurement of electrolyte concentrations would
not be anticipated. lf sodium and chloride are both decreased in an obviously lactescent
sample, another methodology should be used to confirm concentrations of these
electrolytes. Physiologic causes of decreased sodium and chloride include renal wasting or
water retention. Accumulation of free water and dilution of these electrolytes is a potential
mechanism in diabetics because of the ability of excessive amounts of glucose to draw water
into the circulation via osmosis. Renal losses should also be considered, and can be
quantified by performing urinary fractional excretions. Patients with hyponatremia should
have low urinary fractional excretion of sodium as the body attempts to conserve the
electrolyte. Normal to increased fractional excretion under these circumstances would be
abnormal and reflect either renal disease or hypoadrenocorticism (lack of aldosterone to
diagnosis based on the electrolyte pattern, however the changes can be accounted for by
other mechanisms and an ACTH stimulation test is not likely to provide diagnostically useful

evident acid/base abnormalities (normal HCO3 and anion gap) at this time. Dietary deficiency
is rarely the cause of low sodium and chloride in small animal patients on commercial diets.
Hyperkalemia: In this case, a relative or absolute lack of insulin could result in high serum
potassium and may explain the mild hyperkalemia seen here. Potassium may accumulate if
urine cannot be eliminated from the body, but this explanation is not compatible with the
clinical history.

Gerhardt was treated with antibiotics for the nasal discharge. As noted above, his blood

suggests the possibility of a renal cause for the azotemia, although there is certainly a pre-

increased amylase and is compatible with the clinical history. Pancreatic disease cannot be

Urinalysis: The pyuria and bactiuria indicate a urinary tract infection.
Case Summary and Outcome
Miranda's laboratory data normalized after 2 days of appropriate fluid therapy, but
unfortunately she developed melena with anemia and hypoproteinemia while in the hospital.
Because of the history and laboratory results, an ACTH stimulation test was performed to
evaluate Miranda for hypoadrenocorticism. Both pre and post stimulation cortisol levels were
described in dogs with hypoadrenocorticism. This is the result of hypoperfusion of the gut
maintenance of gastrointestinal mucosa. Miranda was given hormone replacement for her
hypoadrenocorticism and was treated with antibiotics for her urinary tract infection. She was
also given anthelmintics because of her signs of gastrointestinal disease. Miranda responded
to treatment and went home.
These clinical signs are common with hypoadrenocorticism, however some types of gastroin-
testinal parasites can also cause laboratory abnormalities similar to hypoadrenocorticism (see

urine). Correction of fluid and electrolyte deficits allows the patient to regain urinary
concentrating ability shortly after initiation of therapy, which would be unlikely in a case of
primary renal failure. Such response to treatment should prompt consideration of an ACTH
 stimulation test to evaluate adrenal gland function. This case should be compared with Jag,
Case 4, in which hypercalcemia of malignancy also resulted in temporary loss of urinary
concentrating ability that may be unrelated to primary renal pathology, although renal lesions
may eventually develop with hypercalcemia. Liver disease may also interfere with the

Interpretation
CBC: Popcorn has a marked neutrophilic leukocytosis with toxic change and monocytosis,
indicating severe inflammation. There is also a mild normocytic, normochromic anemia, which
is likely nonregenerative, but a reticulocyte count would be needed to confirm this. Anemia of
inflammatory disease is the likely cause of this anemia, however the isosthenuria and azotemia
indicates that renal disease could also be a factor in the development of this anemia.

be associated with inadequate nutrition, but poor body condition should be observed
clinically, which is not described here.
Azotemia and isosthenuria: This combination of azotemia and an isosthenuric urine in a
dehydrated patient is suggestive for renal failure, but there are exceptions when extra-renal
factors interfere with renal concentrating ability. Neither osmotic diuresis nor medullary
washout appears probable. Liver failure is a consideration given the hypoglycemia and
hypoalbuminemia, however the biliburin and cholesterol are within reference range. While
liver enzymes may be normal in hepatic failure, the normal values in this patient suggest that
liver failure is unlikely. Diabetes insipidus is a potential consideration. Given the clinical
history, Popcorn should be evaluated for a pyometra. Infection of the uterus by E. coli results
in the elaboration of toxins which may cause polyuria by interfering with sodium and chloride
resorption in the loop of Henle and by causing a reversible insensitivity of the tubules to
antidiuretic hormone. In this case renal function should be re-evaluated once the pyometra
has been successfully treated. The azotemia in this case may be entirely reversible if
 pyometra is the underlying cause. In any case, the dehydration suggests that there is at least 
a pre-renal component to the increased BUN and creatinine.

due to its high frequency. Hypercalcemia of malignancy is often associated with increases in

Hyperproteinemia with hypoalbuminemia and hyperglobulinemia: In patients with
evidence of inflammatory or infectious disease, hyperglobulinemia is most often polyclonal
and due to increased production of acute phase reactants or immunoglobulins. In these
cases, albumin may be low because of downregulation of production in the liver since
infectious peritonitis, Leishmania, or tick borne diseases may cause a monoclonal
gammopathy, which must be distinguished from monoclonal gammopathies produced by
neoplastic lymphocytes. In this case, hypoalbuminemia could be exacerbated by losses into
the uterus.

numbers of mature plasma cells and lymphocytes are considered normal and there is no
evidence of lymphoid malignancy on the smears.
 Case Summary and Outcome
Popcorn was treated with intravenous fluids and antibiotics and had an ovariohysterectomy. A
serum protein electrophoresis confirmed the presence ot a polyclonal gammopathy. Repeat
CBC, serum biochemical profile, and urinalysis were normal eight weeks after surgery, and
This combination of laboratory abnormalities suggested the possibility of several disease
malignancy, and secondary hypercalcemic nephropathy could have explained the azotemia and
isosthenuria (See Case 4, Jag). Most of the laboratory abnormalities could have been
compatible with renal failure alone, especially if the renal failure was related to an inflammatory
process such as pyelonephritis (See Opie, Case 13). In this case, the clinical history and physical
examination were instrumental in prioritizing pyometra as a differential diagnosis. However,
because of the age of the patient, a more intensive evaluation for neoplasia (bone marrow
cytology and serum protein electrophoresis) was conducted prior to surgery because the owner
did not wish to pursue treatment for the pyometra if Popcorn also had neoplasia. As was noted
in other cases in which extra-renal disease influenced BUN, creatinine, or urine specific gravity
(Case 8: sepsis, Case 12: portosystemic shunt, Case 16: hyperthyroidism, Case 22: diabetes
mellitus, Case 23: hypoadrenocorticism), treatment Popcorn's underlying disease was successfu
in restoring urinary concentrating ability and BUN/serum creatinine values to normal.

Leukogram: Although there were no parameters outside the reference intervals in the
leukogram, the increased fibrinogen indicates an acute phase response and inflammation. In
the leukogram.
Erythrogram: The increased hemoglobin and MCHC are artifactual, since the body does not
produce hyperchromatic erythrocytes. Hemolysis, either in vitro or in vivo, can account for
these changes. Because the goat is not anemic, in vitro artifact is more likely than
intravascular hemolysis. In fact, the PCV is at the high end of the reference interval,
 suggesting the potential for mild hemoconcentration.
Serum Biochemical Profile

neutrophilia, lymphocytosis) are evident in the leukogram. Both of these hormones elevate
glucosuria reflects the fact that the renal tubular maximum for reabsorption of 1o0 mg/dl in
the goat has been exceeded (Belknap), but by itself does not justify a diagnosis of diabetes
mellitus, which is very rare in small ruminants. Renal tubular dysfunction can result in
glucosuria in the absence of hyperglycemia.
Azotemia: Azotemia should be categorized as pre-renal, renal, or post-renal. The physical
examination does not provide evidence for post-renal causes of azotemia (large distended or
firm bladder, accumulation of fluid in the abdomen). Renal azotemia appears likely given the
isosthenuric urine, however extra-renal causes of poor urinary concentrating ability should be
ruled out. Medullary washout could interfere with the kidney's ability to optimally

increased or decreased, but the serum phosphorus is usually low, making this an unlikely
diagnosis in Lucinda's case (Rankins). Increased demand for calcium and phosphorus for
gestation and lactation combined with suppressed parathyroid hormone and 1,25-dihydroxy-
cholecalciferol production associated with inappropriate diet interferes with the ability to
mobilize the required minerals from skeletal reserves and contributes to poor intestina
absorption. Grass tetany is another potential cause of hypocalcemia in ruminants.
Hypomagnesemia occurs in grass tetany and can lead to hypocalcemia secondary to a
blunted parathyroid hormone response. In Lucinda, magnesium levels are within the
reference interval, making this diagnosis unlikely at this time. Alkalosis, which is common in
Hypoalbuminemia: Increased losses and decreased production can cause hypoalbuminemia.
Albumin is a negative acute phase reactant and given the high fibrinogen, hepatic
downregulation of production is likely. Other causes of decreased albumin production such
as poor liver function or starvation are not supported by other evidence in this case.
Increased losses of albumin are likely in Lucinda. With the azotemia and proteinuria, urinary
proteinuria could be due to blood contamination or lower urinary tract disease. Clinically
protein loss in this patient because it results in selective loss of albumin. Repeat measure of
urine protein on an atraumatically collected urine sample after any lower urinary tract disease
has been ruled out or treated could clarify the potential for glomerular protein loss; urinary
protein:creatinine ratio may be indicated.
Gastrointestinal losses are possible with her history of diarrhea, but losses generally include
both albumin and globulins. Normal serum globulin does not rule out intestinal loss,
especially if there may be increased production of globulins associated with an acute phase

quantitate, however measurement of fecal α.1-proteinase inhibitor has been used as an
indicator of intestinal protein loss in people and dogs (Murphy). Gastrointestinal parasitism is
material and herd worming history. Other sources of loss less compatible with the clinical
history include dermal and third space losses.
Hypoalbuminemia due to a dilutional effect with overhydration can occur in association with
pregnancy, congestive heart failure, or other causes of fluid retention or overload. Physical
Hyponatremia with proportional hypochloremia: As described for albumin, relative water

excretion. In this case, urinary fractional excretion of sodium and chloride should be low in
renocorticism because of failure of endocrine regulation of renal handling of electrolytes, but
this is rare in small ruminants and generally would be associated with hyperkalemia rather
than hypokalemia. ACTH stimulation test could be run to rule out this possibility.
Hypokalemia: Low intake of potassium is a more likely factor for this electrolyte than for
sodium and chloride. Clinically significant hypokalemia is more likely if combined with
increased losses. Mechanisms for increased loss are similar to those described for NaCl and
include losses through the gastrointestinal tract, into third spaces and through the kidney.
Polyuric renal failure is often associated with hypokalemia as increased tubular flow rates
decrease the time available for potassium reabsorption. Treatment with insulin for
hyperglycemia or with sodium bicarbonate for acid/base abnormalities can cause
translocation ot potassium into cells and result in hypokalemia. It should be noted that serum
levels of sodium, chloride, and potassium do not generally reflect total body stores.
unmeasured anions. In this case, potential unmeasured anions include uremic acids and lactic
acids if there is decreased tissue perfusion. Exogeneous acids such as salicylates,
paraldehyde, and ethylene glycol can also increase the anion gap. Loss of bicarbonate rich
fluids such as saliva or in dliarrhea is possible, and renal disease may compromise the kidney's
ability to compensate for challenges to acid/base balance. Urine pH in ruminants is generally
alkaline, however the acid pH in this case is expected based on the decreased HCO3.
Increased AST and CK: The combination of these changes indicates muscle damage and is
compatible with the history of recumbency in this patient.
268 Mamual of Veterinary Clinical Chemisty: A Case Sudy Approach
Case Summary and Outcome
Based on all of the data, renal failure is the most likely diagnosis. Lucinda was initially anuric,
but a small amount of urine was eventually produced after treatment with furosemide and
dopamine. After one day of hospitalization, Lucinda suffered cardiac and respiratory arrest.
Clinical manifestations of renal failure are poorly documented in goats (Belknap), and even in
better studied species, clinical signs and laboratory abnormalities can vary markedly between
individuals in different stages of disease. The specific cause of renal failure can be impossible
As with other species, a variety of toxins and infectious agents can cause renal failure. Goats
have indliscriminate eating habits and zinc toxicity and ingestion of oxalate containing plants
reported in the goat (Boermans). In this case, treatment with a nephrotoxic antibiotic and a
history of diarrhea and the high-normal PCV. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs interfere
with prostaglandin synthesis and result in impaired renal autoregulation of blood flow,
tubular damage.
Lucinda may be compared with several other patients of various species presenting with
renal failure (horse-Case 9, cat-Cases 10, 13, 17, dog-Cases 11, 14, 15, llama-Case 20). As
noted above, there is a great deal of individual variation in laboratory data between different
patients with renal failure. Some of this variation is species dependent, but much of which is
not. Length and severity of renal failure, concurrent disease processes, and treatment may
influence laboratory results.

and Magnesium
Measurement of Calcium and Phosphorus
The calcium reported in the standard veterinary serum biochemical profile is the tota
calcium, which is made up of biologically active ionized calcium (approximately 50% of the
total under normal circumstances), calcium complexed to anions such as citrate, bicarbonate,
lactate, or phosphate (approximately 5%), and protein-bound calcium that is associated
primarily with albumin and to a lesser extent, globulins (approximately 45%) (Rosol). Various
 proportions of the different fractions, and proportions may be unpredictable in some
conditions such as renal failure (Schenck). Some disease conditions may alter total serum
calcium, but not impact the biologically active fraction, whereas other conditions may be
characterized by normal total serum calcium but changes in the ionized fraction. Therefore, it
sample handling and instrumentation (ion specific electrode).
Phosphorus is present in the serum and plasma in organic and inorganic forms, however clinical
assays reflect only the inorganic component. Like calcium, inorganic phosphorus exists either
free (55%), protein-bound (10%), or complexed to non-protein cations (35%) (Stockham),
Much of the total body magnesium is stored in bone, and most of the remainder is
intracellular; approximately 1% is present in extracellular fluid and can be measured. Like
calcium, a proportion of the total serum magnesium is bound to albumin or globulins, some
forms complexes with anions, and the biologically active ionized fraction predominates. Also
similar to calcium, the measurement of the ionized fraction is preferred under some
circumstances because the proportions of protein-bound, complexed and ionized magnesium
measurements of total magnesium.
Regulation of Calcium and Phosphorus
A complete discussion of the complex regulation of these minerals is beyond the scope of
this chapter, and the reader is referred to textbooks for more detail (Rosol, Stockham). Very
briefly, serum calcium and phosphorus levels reflect the balance of intake, absorption from
the gut or bone, excretion via the kidney, and cellular translocation. The regulation of
magnesium is less clear, however gastrointestinal disease and changes in renal function
impact intake and losses.
Parathyroid Hormone (PTH)
Parathyroid hormone secretion from the parathyroid gland is stimulated by low ionized calcium
levels in the blood. This hormone stimulates calcium reabsorption from bone and increases
absorption of dietary calcium from the intestines. In the kidney, PTH promotes reabsorption of
calcium, excretion of phosphorus, and formation of the active form of vitamin D (Calcitriol).
Calcitonin
Calcitonin secretion from the thyroid C cells is continuous under normal circumstances,
however secretion will be increased in response to hypercalcemia. Calcitonin decreases
reabsorption of calcium from bone, and inhibits renal production of the active form of vitamin
D to reduce serum calcium concentrations. Renal losses of calcium and phosphorus increase
in response to calcitonin.
VitaminD
Vitamin D that is activated in the kidney increases serum calcium and phosphorus by
increasing intestinal absorption of both minerals and by working with PTH to promote bone
272 Manual of Veterinary Clinical Chemisty: A Case Study Approach
resorption. Macrophages in non-malignant granulomatous diseases may produce calcitriol,
which can cause hypercalcemia (Vasilopulos),
Parathyroid Hormone-related Protein (PTHrP)
PTHrP does not play an important role in normal calcium and phosphorus homeostasis in
adult animals, however it does contribute to hypercalcemia of malignancy, one of the most
common causes of hypercalcemia in domestic animals. It is present in multiple tissues at very
low levels in normal animals, but it can be produced in large quantities by some tumors. In

Evaluation of Calcium and Phosphorus
Because of shared regulatory pathways, calcium and phosphorus are often evaluated

two analytes. For a given disease process, abnormalities of calcium tend to be slightly more
consistent than changes in phosphorus. As always, laboratory artifacts and processing errors
invasive diagnostic work up of any aboratory abnormality in the absence of clinical signs
compatible with the abnormality. Also, as for any analyte, remember to consider the
phosphorus metabolism. Ancillary information from the clinical history, physical examination,
imaging studies and other clinical laboratory testing will often help determine the cause ot
changes in calcium and phosphorus.
clinical significance of these abnormalities is unclear because little data is available for
domestic animal species. Interest in evaluation of serum magnesium has been stimulated by
in critical care patients (Rubeiz). There is some data to suggest this may be true in cats (Toll).
appeared to correlate with poor outcome (Garcia-Lopez). Total magnesium measurements
were not predictive in this study, and another study examining total serum magnesium in
hospitalized horses found that a low serum magnesium level was a positive predictor of
survival (Johansson).
Hypocalcemia with Normal Phosphorus

ionized calcium is usually normal. (See Chapter 4 for causes of hypoalbuminemia)
Step 2: Is the patient periparturient or lactating? Additional demands for calcium during
pregnancy or lactation can lower both total and ionized calcium and may or may not be
associated with clinical signs in a variety of species (Fascetti).
Step 3: Is there evidence of pancreatic or gastrointestinal disease? Severe acute
pancreatitis has been associated with hypocalcemia in dogs. Hypocalcemia has been
reported in a high percentage of horses with enterocolitis.
Abnormalities of Calciwm, Phosphorus, and Magnesium   273
Step 4: What is the nutritional status? Grass tetany in cattle may cause hypocalcemia, as
can blister beetle toxicosis in horses. Anorexia from any cause in ruminants can result in
hypocalcemia because of inadequate intake of calcium.
Step 5: Is the patient taking any medications? Some medications such as glucocorticoids,
some anticonvulsants, and chelating compounds can lower serum calcium. Check the
serum biochemical profile on blood anticoagulated with chelators such as EDTA will cause an
artifactual and dramatic decrease in the measured calcium value.
Hypocalcemia with Hyperphosphatemia
Step 1: Is there evidence of renal disease? As noted in Chapter 5, calcium status is
unpredictable in many cases of renal disease in small animals, however phosphorus is
because of chelation of calcium with oxalate, and hyperphosphatemia may be exacerbated
by the presence of phosphates in anti-freeze (see Chapter 5, Case 21). Renal secondary
failure in horses may be associated with hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia (Carlson),
however chronic renal failure in the horse is frequently characterized by hypercalcemia and
hypophosphatemia (see Chapter 5, Case 9).

or related to immune-mediated destruction or surgical removal of the parathyroid glands

acid/base status, which may determine how much of the total calcium is in the biologically
active ionized form.
Step 2: Is the diet adequate, or is there evidence of poor intestinal absorption?
Malabsorption syndromes or anorexia could contribute to low serum calcium and
phosphorus, as can diets with inappropriate calcium:phosphorus ratios.
Hypercalcemia with Normal to Low Phosphorus
Step 1: Is there neoplasia unrelated to the parathyroid gland? Hypercalcemia of
malignancy is most frequently associated with hematopoietic neoplasia, however it is also
common in patients with anal sac apocrine gland adenocarcinomas, squamous cell

274  Mamual of Veterinary Clinical Chemisty: A Case Study Approach
Hypercalcemia with Hyperphosphatemia
Step 1: Is there evidence of renal disease? As noted above, serum calcium values can be
unpredictable in renal failure, however phosphorus is often high because of decreased renal
clearance. In some patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy, the high ionized calcium levels
ca use nephropathy, which results in elevated serum phosphorus.
Step 2: Has the patient been exposed to excessive amounts of Vitamin D (often found in
rodenticides or some toxic plants)? Excessive vitamin D will promote increased absorption of
both calcium and phosphorus. Renal damage may ensue, potentially causing further increases
in calcium and phosphorus. Rarely, granulomatous disease may result in excessive production of
Vitamin D.
Step 3: Does the patient have clinical signs or laboratory abnormalities compatible with
hypoadrenocorticism? Glucocorticoid deficiency may increase absorption of calcium in the gut
and kidneys. Most of this calcium is protein bound, and the increase is often mild, so clinica
pre-renal decrements in glomerular filtration rate relative to hypovolemia.
Step 4: Does the patient have active bone formation or remodeling? Rapid bone growth
in young, large breed dogs or large animals can increase serum calcium and phosphorus (see
Chapter 2, Case 1). Bone remodeling associated with primary or metastatic tumors or
evidence of bone lysis have alterations in serum calcium and phosphorus (see Chapter 2,
Case 3).
Normal Calcium with Hyperphosphatemia
Step 1: Does the patient have an identifiable cause for tissue destruction? Phosphate is a
major intracellular anion, and cell lysis associated with tissue trauma or muscle damage,
hemolysis, and rarely, treatment of hematopoietic tumors (tumor lysis syndrome) can release
large amount of phosphorus into the blood
Step 2: Is the patient hyperthyroid? Feline hyperthyroidism may be associated with increased
serum phosphorus, possibly due to decreased losses.
Hypomagnesemia
is bound to protein, low serum protein levels may cause total magnesium to be low but ionized
magnesium is likely normal.
Step 2: Does the patient have gastrointestinal disease? Low serum magnesium may be
decreased absorption or increased osses (Johansson, Toll).
Step 3: Does the diet have adequate mineral content? This is rarely an issue in small animal
minerals can lead to low serum magnesium. In some situations such as grass tetany, the diet
may be replete, however the magnesium does not appear to be adequately absorbed (Rosol).
Hypermagnesemia
Step 1: Evaluate renal function. The most likely cause of hypermagnesemia is decreased
glomerular filtration rate, although cows with parturient paresis may also have increased
magnesium. Excessive intake is possible.

Hypomagnesemia: In the absence of clinical signs, the significance of this value is unclear.
Case Summary and Outcome
The combination of abnormalities in this sample is compatible with the effects of EDTA
anticoagulant, which contains potassium and chelates calcium and magnesium. It would
appear that a plasma sample had been used for the chemistry panel. A new sample was
collected in a red topped (serum) tube, and all values were within reference intervals.

Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: The most likely cause for this relatively mild abnormality is stress, or possibly
early sepsis. CBC data or fibrinogen concentration would be helpful to further assess the
 potential for an inflammatory condition. Diabetes mellitus is rare in large animal species.
Hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia: Recumbancy in a periparturient, high-producing
dairy cow should prompt evaluation for bovine parturient paresis (milk fever). The
hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia noted here are compatible with that diagnosis. When
measured, serum magnesium is often elevated. Hypocalcemia occurs because of the acute
and extreme demand for calcium associated with onset of colostrum and milk production. It
is difficult for the body to compensate for such an increase in demand after the dry period,
when demand is low and intestinal absorption and bone resorption are likely to be low. As
noted in the introduction to the chapter, the ionized fraction of calcium is the biologically
active fraction, however only total calcium measurements are usually available under most
circumstances, so the appearance and severity of clinical signs may not vary directly with
total serum calcium measurements. Because of protein binding of calcium, serum albumin
and globulins influence total calcium measurements. Acid/base abnormalities that may occur
with concurrent gastrointestinal disease (such as stasis or obstruction) can also influence
ionized calcium levels and therefore the severity of clinical signs at a given total calcium
concentration. Serum phosphorus levels may be low because of decreased feed intake near
demand at parturition.
Increased AST: Increased AST in a recumbent cow is likely due to muscle damage, which is
common in parturient paresis. This impression can be supported by measuring creatine
kinase, which is also often elevated in parturient paresis cases.

Case Summary and Outcome
Daisy responded rapidly to treatment with intravenous calcium, which is often the case in
uncomplicated parturient paresis patients. Often, milk fever is diagnosed on the basis of
clinical signs and the characteristic rapid response to therapy, however collection of
pretreatment blood samples can be helpful in case the patient does not respond to
appropriate therapy within a reasonable amount of time. Other conditions associated with
hypocalcemia in cows include uterine prolapse, dystocia, retained fetal membranes,
abomasal displacement, mastitis, renal disease, and metritis (Hunt).

other laboratory data supporting these causes, the low BUN in this case is of questionable
clinical significance.
Hypocalcemia (both total and ionized) with normal phosphorus: In this case, mild hypoal-
buminemia may account for part, but not all of the low total calcium. In addition, ionized
calcium usually is normal in cases of hypocalcemia secondary to low albumin. The muscle
tremors strongly suggested ionized hypocalcemia, which was confirmed by laboratory
measurement. Eclampsia is a potential cause for low ionized calcium in periparturient female
dogs, but is not a consideration for Bear. With a history of vomiting and diarrhea, pancreatitis

Bear is not azotemic. A urine specific gravity is needed to help assess renal function.
Hypoparathyroidism is rare in dogs and cats, but is compatible with the clinical signs and
relative absence of other serum biochemical abnormalities seen in Bear. In many cases of
hypoparathyroidlism, the serum phosphorus is increased because low levels of PTH lead to
phosphorus retention by the kidney. Serum phosphorus may remain within the reference
interval in some cases because of relatively wide reference ranges or because of concurrent
phosphate depletion associated with anorexia. Serum PTH levels should be low in cases of
hypoparathyroidism. Hypomagnesemia can cause hypocalcemia by interfereing with PTH

"Lolita" is a 2-year-old Standardbred mare. During exercise the day before, she broke away
from the trainer. After exercise this morning, she began to show signs of tying up including
pain, colic, stiffness, a shuffling hindlimb gait, and sweating. She continued to sweat
profusely and by 1.5 hr post exercise, she had dark urine (Figure 6-1). The referring
veterinarian gave her banamine and xylazine for the trip to the referral hospital. Lolita
presented with profuse sweating, synchronous diaphragmatic flutter, and dark urine. She had
a history of a similar episode of tying up last year.

Interpretation
CBC: No abnormalities
Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperphosphatemia: Acute rhabdomyolysis is associated with hyperphosphatemia. The
marked elevations in AST and CK and the discolored urine (probably myoglobin) support
muscle camage and translocation of phosphorus outside of cells as the most likely cause for
the increased phosphorus. Other common causes of increased serum phosphorus include
skeletal growth in immature horses, endurance exercise, and renal failure, none of which are
consistent with the clinical history or other laboratory data (the patient has concentrated
urine and is not azotemic). Less commonly, Vitamin D toxicity will result in hyperphos-
phatemia.
Normal total calcium with slightly low ionized calcium: Hyperphosphatemia leads to a
compensatory decrease in ionized calcium because of mass law interactions and because of
decreased active Vitamin D synthesis by the kidney. As has been described in other cases, a
discrepancy between total calcium and ionized calcium is present in this case and illustrates
the rationale for measurement of the biologically active fraction of the mineral in some
situations.

indicates potential route for loss of magnesium via the skin, although decreased gastroin-
testinal absorption, increased gastrointestinal losses or renal wasting are possible.
Increased HcO3: In general, this value is interpreted as evidence of alkalosis, however the
normal blood gas results make this unlikely. Artfactual elevations of HCO3 have been
reported in two horses and a calf with severe muscle disease (Collins) as a result of
interference with the enzymatic method for detection of bicarbonate by LDH released from
the injured muscle. The original report also described increased anion gaps, which was not 
noted in Lolita. LDH was not reported in Lolita, however her serum sample was run on a
Lolita has a mild acidemia with elevated anion gap, which could be the result of lactic
acidosis or accumulation of another unmeasured anion.
Hyperbilirubinemia: In horses, anorexia should always be considered as a cause of hyper-
bilirubinemia. The concurrently elevated GGT indlicates that cholestasis is another potential
contributor to increased serum bilirubin. Hemolysis may also cause hyperbilirubinemia,
however Lolita is not initially anemic when she presents with elevated bilirubin. Her PCV does
drop significantly over 2 days (although it remains within the reference interval) with no
282 Mamual of Veterinary Clinical Chemisty: A Case Sudy Approach
additional change in serum bilirubin. Some of this decrement in packed cell volume may be
due to splenic contraction secondary to excitement of transport and pain
Increased GGT: Elevations in GGT are compatible with cholestasis, which may be primary or
secondary to hypoxia, gastrointestinal disease, sepsis, or other processes. Enzyme elevations
are not specific as to etiology, however the trend back towards the upper limit of the reference
interval indicates that a complete work up for primary liver disease does not need to be
pursued unless other clinical signs or laboratory abnormalities indicative of liver disease appear.
Marked increases in AST and CK: The combination of these abnormalities is supportive of
rhabdomyolysis, consistent with the clinical impression of tying up. As with liver enzymes,
of trauma, strenuous exercise, trembling, or intramuscular injections may have increased CK.
life of creatine kinase explains the precipitous drop in CK by Day 3 while AST levels remain
increased.
Urinalysis: The dark brown urine collected on Day 1 is consistent with the presence of either
blood, hemoglobin, myoglobin, or bilirubin. Although the information is not available for this
patient, examination of the urine for the presence of erythrocytes will rule in or out
hematuria as a cause for the discoloration. The normal plasma color with cdark urine is

erythrocytes will lyse in urine, leading to a negative sediment examination and the impression
of hemoglobinuria instead of hematuria. An ammonium sulfate test or protein electrophoresis
will confirm the presence of myoglobin. Myoglobin will cause protein, bilirubin, and heme

Case Summary and Outcome
For 4 days, Lolita was treated with lactated ringers supplemented with calcium and
magnesium, banamine?, and vitamin E. She was sent home with instructions to hand walk her

biopsy was suggested as a follow up to assess the potential for polysaccharide storage

the combination of high serum calcium with normal to low phosphorus is neoplasia. Although
many tumors have been documented to cause hypercalcemia of malignancy in small animal
tumors should be primary differential diagnoses. Further diagnostic procedures may include
imaging studies to detect masses or enlarged organs, cytologic or histologic examination of

serum calcium. However this condlition is less likely given Carley's history of steroid
treatment, lack of appropriate clinical signs, and lack of significant electrolyte abnormalities.
Hyperbilirubinemia with increased ALP, GGT, and cholesterol: The elevated ALP, GGT, and
cholesterol are compatible with the presence of cholestasis as a cause for elevated serum
bilirubin. Hemolysis can also contribute to hyperbilirubinemia, however Carley is not anemic,
increased red blood cell destruction. Decreased liver function or sepsis can also contribute to
mild elevations in serum bilirubin. Sepsis is unlikely with a normal leukogram. Liver enzyme
values do not predict liver function, and liver function is best evaluated by measuring serum
bile acids or blood ammonia. Other evidence of severe liver dysfunction, such as hypoalbu-
minemia, low BUN, and hypocholesterolemia are absent in this profile. Therapy with corticos-

polyuria and polydipsia (See Chapter 5, Case 12). Treatment with corticosteroids may
contribute to poor urinary concentrating ability
Case Summary and Outcome
Abdominal ultrasound revealed a markedly enlarged gall bladder compatible with a mucocele,
so Carley went to surgery for gall bladder removal and examination of the abdomen for
evidence of neoplasia. At surgery, biopsy material was collected from the liver and duodenum,
however all other structures appeared grossly normal and were not sampled. Histologically,
the liver had evidence of steroid hepatopathy, the gall bladder showed glandular hyperplasia
Abnormalities of Calcium, Phosphorus, and Magneium  285
Carley recovered well from surgery, and her serum biochemical abnormalities normalized,
with the exception of the hypercalcemia, which was persistent over the next several weeks
and remained in the range of 12-13 mg/dl. In addition, the phosphorus level dropped to
1.3 mg/dl (2.6-7.2). At this point, ultrasound examination of the neck revealed a small mass in
the region of the right parathyroid gland. Carley had another surgery to remove the mass,
which was an expansive but non-invasive parathyroid adenoma characterized by uniform cells
with low mitotic activity and proliferating in solid sheets. PTH and PTHrP levels were not
measured since a parathyroid mass was located using ultrasound.

Interpretation
CBC: Only limited data are available. There is an anemia that cannot be adequately
characterized as regenerative or non-regenerative without erythrocyte indices or a
microscopic evaluation of anisocytosis and polychromasia and reticulocyte count. A nonre-
generative anemia in association with azotemia, isosthenuria, and abnormalities of calcium
and phosphorus is compatible with renal failure. Hypercalcemia of malignancy with secondary
effects on the kidney can result in similar laboratory abnormalities. Anemia of chronic disease
is a common cause of mild, nonregenerative anemia in small animal patients and is likely a
factor in the development of Picasso's anemia. Alternatively, hematopoietic malignancies

be ruled out here, although it is less common than the following differential diagnoses.
Azotemia with isosthenuria implicates renal failure as a cause for hyperphosphatemia due to
failure patients, and may not correlate with ionized calcium. In renal failure, hyperphos-
phatemia inhibits renal 1a-hydroxylase, which decreases production of calcitriol and reduces
intestinal calcium absorption and decreases ionized calcium concentration. In response, PTH

Increased ALP: There are numerous potential causes for increased ALP in dogs, including
enzyme induction by hormones or drugs, metabolic alterations, and liver disease. As an
isolated abnormality, its clinical significance is unclear, particularly if the patient is not taking
any medications that could elevate ALP. Re-evaluation of liver enzymes in 2-4 weeks may reveal
Urinalysis: The significance of the isosthenuria is discussed above. The urine sediment is
inactive and there is no evidence of inflammation or other lower urinary tract pathology.
Thus, the elevated protein:creatinine ratio can be interpreted as compatible with glomerular

(reference interval = 1.25-1.45). Intact PTH was increased while PTHrP was within reference
roidism may be associated with either high, low, or normal total calcium, but ionized calcium
ultrasound examination of the neck and parathyroid glands was recommended. The owners
did not elect to pursue this option so the diagnosis could not be confirmed.
This case should be compared with Carley (Case 5), in which primary hyperparathyroidism
was confirmed by identification of a parathyroid adenoma. Her case was complicated with
concurrent hepatobiliary disease, however her renal function appeared to be better than
Picasso's based on the normal BUN, creatinine, and normal to low phosphorus. Like Picasso
Carley's urine was not concentrated, probably related to the effects of high ionized calcium
on the renal tubules.

Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: This may be attributable to stress, however neonatal foal serum glucose may
be higher than adults, with an average of 135-150 mg/dl (Vaala).
Azotemia and hyperphosphatemia: Common causes of increased serum phosphorus include
skeletal growth in immature horses, endurance exercise, and decreases in glomerular
filtration rate secondary to acute renal failure or pre-renal causes. The signalment of this foal
of a neonatal foal is 5-6 mg/dl. However General is also azotemic. Because of high milk
intake, foals generally produce large volumes of dilute urine, and specific gravity readings of
gravity is somewhat concentrated, so the azotemia is likely pre-renal
Hypoproteinemia: Low total protein in neonatal animals may reflect the increased total body
young animals because of a relatively naive immune system. Given the perinatal history.
evaluation of passive transter status using a test such as lgG is recommended.
Hyperbilirubinemia: Neonatal foals have higher serum bilirubin values than adult horses
(average 4.3 mg/dl), however this is still elevated even for a foal. In horses, anorexia should
always be considered as a cause of hyperbilirubinemia. Hemolysis is another possible cause
of hyperbilirubinemia. Although his PCV is normal, this foal should be monitored for evidence
of developing neonatal isoerythrolysis.
Increased ALP: This is likely an age-related change due to increased release of the bone
consideration because of General's clinical presentation.
Increased CK: Increased CK indicates muscle damage and is compatible with the history of
dystocia and lameness. CK may be a more sensitive indicator of muscle damage than AST.
Case Summary and Outcome
General was treated with nutritional supplementation after the death of his mother. Over a
few days, his mobility improved and his prognosis was considered good. Repeat blood work
24 hours after presentation showed diminished azotemia and normal CK. His serum
phosphorus normalized with a persistently elevated ALP, indicating that the initial hyperphos-
phatemia was more likely related to the pre-renal azotemia than bone growth. Unless
otherwise specifically indicated, reference ranges for domestic animal species are usually
including age, on "normal" values for clinical pathology data. This case can be compared
Abnormalities of Calcium, Phosphorus, and Magneium  293
with Spunky (Chapter 2, Case 1), a puppy with age related changes in calcium, phosphorus,
and ALP. Interpretation of data on analytes that could be influenced by age should be
considered in light of clinical signs and other laboratory data. For example, because General
had a high risk history and concurrent azotemia, his hyperphosphatemia was considered to
potentially be related to decreased glomerular filtration rate, while Spunky had hyperphos-
phatemia but no other laboratory data suggesting alterations in glomerular filtration rate. In
both General and Spunky, the absence of any other liver enzyme elevations to accompany
the increased ALP was taken as evidence of an age-related change rather than an indication
of liver disease. In General, this interpretation was slightly more difficult because of the
concurrent hyperbilirubinemia, which could be compatible with cholestasis/liver disease.

Interpretation
CBC
Leukogram: The slight increase in fibrinogen could be compatible with mild inflammation.
While the site of the inflammation cannot be determined from this value alone, there may be
residual inflammation from the colic. Acute phase reactants such as fibrinogen may be more
sensitive indicators of inflammation in some species, therefore the normal leukogram does
not rule out inflammation.
Serum Biochemical Profile
Azotemia: Azotemia with isosthenuria usually suggests renal failure, as long as extrarenal
factors that could impair renal concentrating ability are ruled out (for example osmotic
diuresis, medullary washout, and some endocrinopathies, see Chapter 5). Some authors
describe a relatively high BUN/creatinine ratio of greater than 10:1 with chronic renal failure
in horses versus a ratio less than 10:1 with acute renal failure. It is common for pre-renal
azotemia to become superimposed on primary renal failure in dehydrated patients. The colic
episode may have exacerbated previously subclinical chronic renal disease in this patient,
causing fluid deficits.
Hypercalcemia with normal phosphorus: Hypercalcemia with normal to low phosphorus is
often described in equine patients with chronic renal failure. This is in contrast to small animal
patients, who generally have hyperphosphatemia and a somewhat unpredictable calcium
status. PTH does not appear to be responsible for the hypercalcemia in horses. Rather it 
appears to be related to dietary intake of calcium and may reflect inability of the
dysfunctional kidneys to eliminate dietary calcium. Hypercalcemia in horses with chronic renal
failure is often worse on alfalfa hay and may improve on grass hay. Therefore, not all horses
with chronic renal failure will have hypercalcemia. Horses with acute renal failure may be
more likely to have low total serum calcium.
Abnormalities of Calcium, Phosphorus, and Magmesium

noted in horses with both acute and chronic renal failure. Previous isotonic or hypertonic fluid
losses associated with colic and replaced with oral intake of water may further depress serum
electrolytes. Pain associated with colic can result in sweating, which can be another
significant source of sodium and chloride loss. Mild hyperkalemia has been described in
horses with chronic renal failure or severe acute renal failure, but was not present in Nevada
at presentation.
Increased GGT: In an adult horse, increased GGT is evidence of liver damage or cholestasis.
Liver damage may be attributed to the previous episode of colic, or associated with hepatic
lipidosis from the recent anorexia. Severe cholestasis is unlikely with the normal bilirubin.
Increased AST and CK: AST is present in multiple tissues and elevations can be difficult to
interpret. Nevada's increased GGT and AST suggests some liver pathology, however the
for some of the increase in AST. Like GGT, elevations in AST are not specific as to the
etiology of the tissue damage. Increases in CK can be associated with intramuscular injection,
trauma during transportation, and muscle damage with down or rolling animals.
Urinalysis: Normal horse urine is often cloudy because of high mucus content and the
presence of calcium carbonate crystals, while horses with renal failure may have clear urine
because of the prodluction of high volumes of dilute urine and relative calcium retention
(Figure 6-3). Herbivore urine is generally alkaline, however, the urine pH may decrease with
uremic or lactic acidosis.
Figure 6-3. Normal equine urine
with calcium carbonate crystals.
Case Summary and Outcome
Nevada was treated with intravenous fluids and his azotemia resolved. The combination of
laboratory abnormalities and clinical signs, including polyuria/polydipsia and increased dental
plaque, were considered to be consistent with chronic renal failure. His episode of colic
superimposed on his more chronic renal disease.
Nevada may be compared with Margarite (Chapter 5, Case 9). Margarite had more acvanced
disease than Nevada, and in addlition to the abnormalities shared with Nevada, had hypophos-
phatemia, and hyperkalemia. As with small animal patients, anemia may be present in horses
with renal failure, although it was not present in either Nevada or Margarite at presentation.
296 Mamual of Veterinary Clinical Chemisty: A Case Sudy Approach
Nevada may also be contrasted with Faith (Chapter 5, Case 19) or General (Case 8), cases of
pre-renal azotemia. Note that Faith had hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia, which is more
common in horses with pre-renal azotemia or acute renal failure than in horses like Nevada or
Margarite with chronic renal failure. Faith had concentrated urine at the time of presentation,
which would suggest that she had adequate renal function. However, she was treated with
high doses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, which can be nephrotoxic under
some circumstances. Other cases of renal disease in large animals include Forsythia (Chapter
5, Case 20, Illama) and Lucinda (Chapter 5, Case 25, goat).

biopsy. Austin was treated at the referring clinic with intravenous fluids and antibiotics. He was
transferred to the referral institution after he developed ascites. On physical examination,
Austin has mild icterus and moderate ascites. While he is very lethargic, he does not appear to

regenerative, however if the blood loss is mild, acute, or if other factors such as chronic
disease are blunting a response, they may appear non-regenerative. The anisocytosis,
polychromasia, and basophilic stippling could be compatible with some marrow response
and serial CBC's with reticulocyte counts may demonstrate some marrow activity. The clinica
significance of a single nucleated erythrocyte/100 WBC is questionable and may be
encountered in a normal animal. Endothelial damage of any cause or lesions of the
hematopoietic tissues could result in premature release of nucleated erythroid precursors.
Thrombocytopenia: In combination with data from the coagulation profile, the thrombocy
topenia could be compatible with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DlC). Because
there is also a non-regenerative anemia, primary marrow disorders could be considered,
however extramarrow causes can explain Austin's CBC abnormalities.

Serum Biochemical Profile
Hypoglycemia: Artifactual hypoglycemia was ruled out in this case. Given the chronic history
of liver disease, decreased liver function and inadequate gluconeogenesis should be evaluated
as a potential cause for low blood glucose. Other abnormalities that would support this cause
include low BUN and albumin with evidence of ongoing liver disease (increased liver
enzymes), however specific tests of liver function such as serum bile acids and blood ammonia
should be performed (See Chapter 2). Nutritional factors are unlikely to cause hypoglycemia
unless the body condition score is low, and there are other signs of starvation. Paraneoplastic
Low BUN: As described above, decreased liver function should be investigated as a cause for
low BUN in this case. Polyuria and polydipsia, which is likely in this case given the low urine
specific gravity, can also contribute to low BUN because of rapid tubular flow rates and
inadequate time for urea reabsorption (See Chapter 5, Case 22). The dark stools suggest
gastrointestinal bleeding, which conversely may increase BUN. It appears that the degree of
hemorrhage is insufficient to offset the decreases in BUN produced by the other mechanisms.
Hypocalcemia: Because a significant amount of total serum calcium is protein bound, low
fraction is not expected to change, therefore clinical signs of hypocalcemia are unlikely.
Correction formulas have been developed for the dog, however their clinical application in
disease may be questionable (Schenck).
selective loss or decreased production of albumin. Routes of protein loss include skin, third
space, the gastrointestinal tract, and the kidneys. Renal losses are most likely to be selective
albumin and globulins. Renal losses of protein are less likely in the absence of measurable
amounts of proteinuria, however Austin's urine is dilute and a urine protein:creatinine ratio
may be a more sensitive measure of urine protein content. Inadequate production of albumin
by a poorly functional liver can also result in disproportionately low albumin and is likely in
this case. While some globulin proteins are produced in the liver, immunoglobulin production
is unaffected because it is extrahepatic. Globulins may even increase in patients with liver
failure as generalized immune stimulation can result from inadequate Kupfer cell surveillance
of portal blood and increased systemic exposure to bacteria and toxins from the gut. Some
gastrointestinal protein loss is suspected because of the dark stool, however if globulin
values were initially high because of the decreased liver function, the decrease attributable to
Hypokalemia: Poor intake combined with third space losses (ascites) and possible gastroin-
testinal losses ot potassium explain the hypokalemia.
Hyperbilirubinemia: The major causes of hyperbilirubinemia are decreased liver function,
cholestasis, hemolysis or sepsis. Decreased liver function with or without cholestasis are likely
based on the serum biochemical profile. Hemolysis is possible because of the anemia,
however specific morphologic abnormalities of the erythrocytes such as spherocytes or Heinz
bodies that would explain hemolysis are not described. Like blood loss anemias, hemolytic
anemias are generally regenerative, however if mild or acute, there may be no evidence of
regeneration (see discussion of erythrogram above). There is no evidence of sepsis in the CBC
as a cause for increased serum bilirubin.

Increased ALP and GGT: While there are many nonspecific causes of increased ALP and GGT
in the dog (See Chapter 2), cholestasis and liver disease are the most likely source of the
increasedenzymesinthiscase.
Increased ALT and AST: Increases in these enzymes indicate hepatocellular damage, but do
not imply a cause. The previous histologic diagnosis of chronic active hepatitis is sufficient to
account for hepatocellular damage. It is important to note that while increased liver enzymes
do provide evidence of hepatic pathology, they are not liver function tests. If sufficient
numbers of hepatocytes are lost, liver enzyme levels may return to baseline levels despite
continuing liver disease and decreased liver function. An acute decrease in PCV with
associated hypoxia could further damage liver cells. AST is less liver specific than the ALT and
may increase with muscle damage. Measurement of creatine kinase would help determine if
muscle damage could account for some of the increase in AST.
Coagulation profile: The prolonged clotting times, thrombocytopenia, and increased FDPs
are compatible with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DlC). Alternatively, sufficiently
fibrin degradation products, decreased liver function will also result in increased FDPs.
Regardless, the patient is still considered to have a coagulopathy.
Urinalysis: Polyuria can characterize liver failure (See Chapter 2 for details, also see Chapter
2, Case 10; Chapter 3, Case 7; Chapter 5, Case 12). The significance of small numbers of
leukocytes in the absence of bacteria in a voided sample is unclear, however urine culture
could be considered to rule out the possibility of a urinary tract infection.
Case Summary and Outcome
A repeat ultrasound of the liver revealed a small, irregularly nodular liver, compatible with
cirrhosis. Blood ammonia concentration was within the reference interval, however serum bile
than serum bile acids, and the preponderance of other laboratory data is compatible with
and the abnormal coagulation data, another biopsy was not performed. Austin was
hospitalized and treated with intravenous fluids, antibiotics, gastroprotectants, and small 
doses of diuretics to reduce the ascites. Minimal improvement was noted in the laboratory
values, however Austin appeared brighter and his ascites was reduced. He was discharged to
his owners on medical management with a guarded to poor long term prognosis.
Other cases of hypocalcemia and hypoalbuminemia related to decreased liver function
include hepatic lipidosis (Chapter 2, Case 11) and portosystemic shunt (Chapter 2, Case 12).
calcium. Although low total serum calcium is often attributed to hypoalbuminemia, some
maintain total serum calcium concentrations within reference intervals. This is true for YapYap
(Chapter 3, Case 7), who presented with a portosystemic shunt and more severe hypoalbu
reference intervals. A variety of physiological influences including pH and competitive
binding of calcium or albumin with other substances in the blood can influence the
relationship of total serum calcium and albumin in individual patients.

Azotemia and dilute urine with dehydration: This combination of laboratory abnormalities
is suggestive for renal failure, but there are exceptions when extra-renal factors interfere with
renal concentrating ability. If the patient is dehydrated, a pre-renal component may be
superimposed on the other causes of azotemia.

changes unpredictably in renal failure, and total calcium may be high, low or normal. In
middle-aged and older patients, hypercalcemia of malignancy should also be considered
because cancer is an important cause of increased calcium in this demographic
Hypokalemia: Decreased intake associated with anorexia and increased losses via the

the azotemia and hyperphosphatemia. Clinical signs are vague and include gastrointestinal
abnormalities, so pancreatic disease cannot be completely ruled out.
302 Manual of Veterinary Clinical Chemisty: A Case Study Approach
Urinalysis: Because white blood cells were noted in a urine sample collected by cystocentesis,
the potential for a urinary tract infection should be evaluated by urine culture. The finding of
100 mg/dl of protein in a poorly concentrated urine sample is also of concern. A urine
protein:creatinine ratio is recommended as a more sensitive way to evaluate the proteinuria. It
is important to consider that the proteinuria may be the result of lower urinary tract disease
rather than glomerular lesions if there is evidence of inflammatory/infectious processes.
Case Summary and Outcome
Star was treated with intravenous fluids, antihypertensive medication, and gastroprotectants.
Her urine culture was negative and the urine protein:creatinine ratio was markedly elevated,
compatible with glomerular disease. The clinicians decided against performing a renal biopsy
to confirm this impression because they did not feel that additional information that would
alter the treatment plan would be gained and they were concerned about complications from
the procedure. Star was discharged from the hospital, however she returned a week later
membranes and melena. It was thought that Star had developed gastrointestinal ulceration
from uremia and she was humanely euthanized because of her poor prognosis.
Hypoalbuminemia is often used as a criterion for the diagnosis of glomerular disease,
however several factors may influence serum albumin levels. At presentation, Star was
dehydrated, which increased her serum albumin. In addition, patients with healthy livers and
an adequate diet can often maintain serum albumin concentrations for some period of time
despite significant losses. Patients that co have hypoalbuminemia associated with glomerular
example, Sheba (Chapter 5, Case 5) presented with hypoalbuminemia that was attributed to
renal disease, however her total serum calcium was within reference intervals. The
unpredlictable effects of renal disease on calcium may contribute to complexity in the
relationship between total serum calcium and albumin. As always with renal disease, serum
ionized calcium must be measured for optimal evaluation of calcium status (Schenck)

renal because there is no information about urinary concentrating ability. The absence of a
palpable urinary bladder could be compatible with failure of urine production or ruptured
bladder secondary to urethral blockage or trauma such as being hit by a car. The electrolyte
abnormalities are compatible with uroabdomen (see Chapter 5, Case 18), however there is
no description of fluid accumulation in the peritoneal cavity. Because the cat goes outdoors,
the history provided by the owners may be incomplete.
Hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia: Hyperphosphatemia in this case is most likely due
to decreased glomerular filtration rate and the inability to eliminate urine from the body.
Calcium levels are variable in renal failure and total values may not correlate with ionized
calcium as they often do in patients with normal renal function. Hypocalcemia may occur
secondary to hyperphosphatemia, and acute renal failure can result in more pronounced

suggests a greater acid/base disturbance than the mildly low HCO3 would suggest. Uremic
acidosis may combine with vomiting induced alkalosis to create a mixed acid/base disorder.
Candidates for unmeasured anions contributing to the high anion gap in this case include
metabolites of ethylene glycol.
Increased ALT and AST: The elevated ALT is compatible with hepatocellular damage; AST is
less tissue specific and could also reflect cellular damage of other tissues such as muscle

Case Summary and Outcome
Jill was treated with a bolus of fluids and calcium gluconate, however there was little response
and no urine production was observed. She was euthanized due to poor prognosis. After
further questioning, the owner did recall leakage of anti-freeze from one of the family cars,
but no necropsy was performed to pursue a definitive diagnosis.
This case should be compared with Brianna (Chapter 5, Case 21), a dog with renal failure
however a more complete data base was obtained for Brianna that was able to document
isosthenuria. Characteristic calcium oxalate crystals were not noted in either patient
Electrolyte patterns were similar in these two cases, however Jill also had liver enzyme
Based on the calcium/phosphorus pattern, other differentials for Jill could have included
renal disease of other etiologies including urethral obstruction (see Chapter 5, Case 7 with
filtration rate, and hypoparathyroidism (Case 3). Remember that amylase is a poor indicator
of pancreatitis in cats, so the normal value in this patient should not be used to rule out this
diagnosis, however most cats have a more chronic and indolent form of the disease
Hypoparathyroidism by itself is unlikely to account for the azotemia.

corticism can produce these changes. Both renal failure and hypoadrenocorticism are
compatible with the other laboratory data. In both these conditions, inadequate glomerular

"Zinger" is an 11-year-old neutered male domestic short haired cat. Zinger was diagnosed
with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and mild left-sided congestive heart failure one month
ago, for which he is being treated with diuretics (furosemide) and aspirin. Historical
laboratory abnormalities at the time of diagnosis included prerenal azotemia (urine specific
gravity 1.056) and mild elevations of ALT and AST that were interpreted to be compatible
with the cardiac disease. His thyroid panel was within normal limits. Two weeks ago, Zinger
presented with thrombosis of his right front foot, which was managed successfully with
anticoagulants. Today, Zinger presents with a four day history of anorexia, vomiting, and
decreased urinations. He is dehydrated, depressed, and has a very small bladder. Zinger's

to clehydration, compromised cardliac function is a cause of pre-renal azotemia because of

Hyperphosphatemia and normal calcium: The most likely cause of hyperphosphatemia in
this patient is decreased glomerular filtration rate, regardless of whether the decreased
glomerular filtration rate is due to pre-renal, renal, or post-renal causes. Tissue necrosis can
also increase serum phosphorus by releasing intracellular phosphorus. Small animal patients

Hypermagnesemia: Like phosphorus, serum magnesium levels will increase as glomerular

rhabdomyolysis can lead to extracellular release of magnesium.

increased renal losses of potassium and hypokalemia. Hyperkalemia may develop when urine
production decreases in oliguric or anuric renal failure, which is possible with the history of
clecreasing frequency of urinations and a small urinary bladder despite diuretic therapy.
Because of the history of thromboembolic disease and the concurrent elevations in
phosphorus, magnesium, and CK, tissue necrosis should be considered a potential cause for
inadequately concentrated urine (See Chapter 5, Case 23).
Decreased HCO3 and increased anion gap: This is compatible with metabolic acidosis
associated with accumulation of unmeasured anions, such as uremic acids. In general, the
chloride will vary inversely with the HCO3, which is not the case in this patient and a mixed
acid/base disorder may be present. Blood gas analysis may be required for full characteri-
zation of the acid/base status. The history of cardiopulmonary disease and thromboembolic
Hypercholesterolemia: There are numerous potential causes for hypercholesterolemia in
small animal patients, including metabolic disorders and endocrinopathies. In this case,
hypercholesterolemia is probably associated with the renal disease.
314 Mamual of Veterinary Clinical Chemisty: A Case Study Aproach
Increased Creatine Kinase: This is evidence for muscle degeneration or necrosis, and raises
the possibility of another episode of thromboembolic complications of the cardiac disease.
Urinalysis: The 2+ protein in dilute urine with an inactive sediment is compatible with
glomerular loss of protein. A urine protein:creatinine ratio is recommended to further
evaluate urinary protein losses. Given the inactive sediment in this case, the proteinuria is
unlikely to be the result of blood contamination or lower urinary tract disease. Significant
glomerular protein loss is not always associated with hypoalbuminemia because of the
capacity of a healthy liver for compensatory upregulation of albumin production. Dehydration
can also mask hypoproteinemia, which may be the case in this patient since the serum
albumin is just at the lower end of the reference interval.
Case Summary and Outcome
Despite aggressive therapy, Zinger stopped producing urine and was euthanized. No
necropsy was performed, but it was strongly suspected that acute renal failure could have
been precipitated by additional thromboembolic episodes. The presence of hyperphos-

case can be compared with Lolita (Case 4), in which rhabdomyolysis resulted in elevated

"Diva" is 5-year-old spayed female domestic short haired cat. After being missing for seven
weeks, she was found in a garage. On presentation, she is obtunded, hypothermic (<90°F),
bradycardic (30 bpm), and has very slow respiratory rate. Diva is cachectic and has lost
approximately half of her previous body weight. Diva is profoundly dehydrated and blood
pressure cannot be measured. She was immedliately intubated for ventilation, and an
intraperitoneal bolus of warmed physiologic saline was administered. Diva was extubated
when she became responsive, and it was possible to collect blood samples for analysis and
begin intravenous fluid therapy. However, generalized seizures and tetany followed,
 culminating in respiratory arrest with resuscitation. She was placed on a ventilator and
weaned off over night. Parenteral nutrition was initiated on Day 2, at which time Diva was
very weak but more stable. A transfusion was given on Day 3.

is a normocytic normochromic anemia of variable severity throughout Diva's hospitalization.
Some of the decrease between Day 1 and 3 is because of dilution following correction of
fluid deficits and dehydration. Anemia of chronic disease and chronic malnutrition are the
most obvious causes for this anemia,although the patient should also be evaluated for
fleas/ticks and gastrointestinal parasites that could further depress the PCV. There also may
be a hemolytic component as Heinz bodies were noted on Day 1. The clinical significance of
Heinz bodies in cats depends on the number and size of the Heinz bodies. Sick cats

quite variable, and reversible hypoglobulinemia may occur (Kaneko). Other causes of
decreased globulin proteins include various immunodeficiency states that are unlikely in this
associated with hemorrhage, body cavity effusions, gastrointestinal lesions, or diffuse
exudative dermallesions (See Deputy, Case 14)
Increased ALP: There are fewer nonspecific causes of increased ALP in cats than dogs, and
some degree of hepatic lipidosis is possible. Many cats with clinically significant hepatic
lipidosis also will have elevations in bilirubin and ALT, which Diva does not have. Other
considerations for this increase include poor perfusion, sepsis, trauma, or hyperthyroidism
The latter is not as likely in a relatively young cat.
Increased AST: Increased AST most often indicates liver or muscle pathology, however the
ALT is not elevated to support hepatocellular damage. No CK levels are available to further
evaluate muscle status. As with the ALP, poor perfusion, trauma, sepsis, and hyperthyroidism
could elevate AST.

By Days 3 and 4, the classical laboratory abnormalities of hypophosphatemia,

Diva's presentation illustrates the relatively mild serum biochemical abnormalities that
accompany even profound starvation. During starvation in humans, metabolism shifts from
being primarily dependent on carbohydrates to fat, with ketone bodies and free fatty acids
supplying most of the energy in the body. Insulin levels drop. When carbohydrates are

increased demand associated with carbohydrate refeeding and this contributes to the
development of clinical signs (Crook). The extent to which these pathophysiologic processes
may be extrapolated to cats, which have a more protein-based metabolism is unclear (Zoran),

Low serum creatinine: This value may be attributed to the low muscle mass described in the

Hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia: Some proportion of the hypocalcemia is likely
dogs with protein losing enteropathy (Kimmel, Kull, Melzer). It is speculated that low calcium
and phosphorus levels may be related to poor intestinal absorption or impaired absorption of
Vitamin D. Prolonged diuresis may also contribute to renal losses of phosphorus.
Hypomagnesemia: Low serum magnesium may reflect poor absorption and gastrointestinal
losses, although renal losses cannot be excluded. Hypovitaminosis D, if present, could also
contribute to low serum magnesium levels. Like calcium, the biologically active fraction of
magnesium is ionized. Measurement of ionized magnesium is recommended if suspicious
clinical signs develop.
Panhypoproteinemia: Decreases in both albumin and globulins suggests nonselective

been receiving a low dose of corticosteroids. However, the change in GGT is relatively

underlying liver disease, or liver enzyme elevations may occur secondary to intestinal
damage. The precise causes cannot be determined and are similar to those described for
ALP and GGT.

Case Summary and Outcome
The liver appeared normal on ultrasonographic examination. Endoscopic biopsies of the
stomach revealed mild infiltration of the lamina propria by lymphocytes, plasma cells and
eosinophils. Multiple sections of small intestine contained a similar inflammatory cell
population and dilated lacteals, which were also evident on endoscopic examination. Dilation
of the lacteals may be seconcary to the inflammation and could improve with immunomodu-
lation. As a result, June's prednisone dose was increased, and another immunosuppressive
drug was added to the treatment regimen.
Familial protein-losing enteropathy of soft coated wheaten terriers was considered as a
potential diagnosis, however most of these dogs present at an earlier age, usually around 5
years old (Littman). The basis for this enteropathy is unclear, and evaluation of dietary factors
including gluten sensitivity have produced equivocal data (German). It may be important to
distinguish the familial syndrome from spontaneous protein-losing enteropathy because of
the poor prognosis associated with the familial disease (Littman). Scoring indices to grade

Very mild hyperglycemia: This change is compatible with stress.
Azotemia with poorly concentrated urine: Poorly concentrated urine with increased BUN

the biologically active ionized fraction should be measured to assess the potential for
magnesium-related hypoparathyroidism.
Hypomagnesemia: Low intake and increased gastrointestinal losses likely combine to cause
the hypomagnesemia. Because significant amounts of serum magnesium are protein bound,
Hyperproteinemia with hypoalbuminemia and hyperglobulinemia: Low albumin with
increased globulins suggests either decreased production of albumin or selective loss of
albumin. Decreased production of albumin occurs with inflammation because albumin is a
negative acute phase reactant. Severe or prolonged starvation can increase albumin utilization
and decrease production, but is unlikely in this case if Glamor's body condition is adequate.

ALP, and GGT make this less likely. Selective loss of albumin can result from glomerular
disease; losses can be quantified by measuring urine protein:creatinine ratios. Although renal
disease is strongly suspected in this case, there has been no evaluation of urine protein. Other
potential routes for protein loss include the gastrointestinal tract (there is a history of diarrhea)
and the draining tracts. Concurrent losses of globulins may be masked by markedly increased
production associated with inflammation (acute phase reactants and immunoglobulins).
Hyponatremia and hypochloremia: Excessive electrolyte losses via the kidney or gastroin-
testinal tract are likely, although third spaces losses into the thorax or via exudative lesions are

likely based on the clinical history and laboratory cata. Because significant respiratory disease

Case Summary and Outcome
Glamor was treated with intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and topical ophthalmic medications. Her
eye lesions did not respond to medical therapy, and the cornea eventually perforated and was
treated surgically. Glamor's condition remained critical with decreasing serum protein levels, 50
total parenteral nutrition was instituted along with plasma transfusions. Her breathing and
azotemia were improving with treatment, but several days later, Glamor began to bleed
excessively from venipuncture sites. Her coagulation times were within reference intervals, but
she was thrombocytopenic. Glamor dlied later that day. On necropsy, Glamor had multiple
pulmonary abscesses, severe small intestinal enteritis, and ulcerative colitis. Multiple foci of
necrosis were noted in both kidneys, compatible with the clinical suspicion of acute renal failure.
Multiple cases of renal failure in various species have been presented in previous chapters and
can be compared with Glamor. In particular, the calcium and phosphorus cata can be contrasted

suspected of having pre-renal azotemia (Case 8 and Chapter 5, Case 19) had hyperphos-
phatemia and normal to high total serum calcium. The presence of concentrated urine is
important in differentiating chronic renal failure from pre-renal azotemia. Dietary content of
calcium may also influence the serum calcium data in patients with compromised renal function.

Electrolyte and Acid/Base Evaluation
General Background
The regulation of electrolyte and acid/base balance is extremely complex. While a few basic
mechanisms clearly influence this balance, it may be very difficult to determine the exact
cause for an abnormality in an individual patient when multiple or complex disorders are
documentation of their significance in domestic animal species. Therefore, some of the
mechanisms for abnormalities in the cases that follow may be somewhat speculative. As we
have seen with many other analytes, the interpretation of indicators of electrolyte and
accompany a particular condition because of the influence of so many variables, including 
food intake, duration and severity of disease, or effects of treatment. Multiple examples of
some entities are included in this chapter to demonstrate the variability of clinical chemistry
abnormalities in patients with the same primary diagnosis.
Electrolyte concentrations in the blood reflect the electrolyte content of the extracellular fluid
and do not accurately reflect intracellular content or total body stores of that electrolyte.
Serum electrolyte values are the sum of gains and losses from the gastrointestinal tract,
kidney, skin, third space (body cavities and interstitium), and intracellular space. In addition,
serum electrolyte concentrations are influenced by the addition or loss of free water from the
vascular space, so they should be interpreted in the context of the hydration status of the
patient. For example, a bleeding patient proportionately loses both water and electrolytes,
so initially the serum electrolyte values will be normal despite volume depletion in the
intravascular space. Compensatory water retention by the kidney and increased thirst
until other mechanisms replace the needed electrolyte. The packed cell volume and total
 protein may provide additional information about free water balance, however primary or
secondary disease processes may influence the production and/or losses of erythrocytes and
protein. In some cases, multiple abnormalities combine to result in a normal value, which may
mask underlying pathologic changes.
Acid/base status may be evaluated using parameters on the routine serum biochemical
profile. HCO3, anion gap, and chloride can give information about acid/base status, but in
some cases, a blood gas analysis will be required for further evaluation. Acid/base and
whole. Patients with gastrointestinal and/or renal disease are particularly likely to have
acid/base and electrolyte abnormalities because of the central roles of these organs in the
uptake and elimination of these analytes. A complete discussion of the physiology of
electrolyte and acid/base biochemistry is beyond the scope of this book, and the reader is
Sodium
Sodlium is the major cation in the extracellular fluid, including the serum. Sodium is often
used by the body to drive cellular transport systems and water reabsorption. Serum sodium
 measurements are preferred because they less likely to be affected by the presence of
hyperlipidemia or hyperproteinemia, which may artifactually depress electrolyte
measurements performed using flame photometry. With direct potentiometric methods using
ion specific electrodes, there is no dilution of the samples and lipemic interference with

328 Manual of Veterinary Clinical Chemisty: A Case Study Approach
part of the assay, artifactual lowering of electrolyte concentrations may be observed with
severe lipemia. If both sodium and chloride are decreased in an obviously lactescent sample,
another methodology should be used to confirm concentrations of these electrolytes. This
As referred to above, serum sodium concentration reflects the ratio of sodium to water in the
vascular space and so may be affected by alterations in free water balance independent of
real changes in total body sodium. Likewise, proportional loss of both water and sodium will
result in normal serum sodlium concentrations despite dehydration and low total body
sodium. Serum sodium is primarily regulated by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system
antidiuretic hormone.
Hypernatremia
1. ↑ sodium intake
2. ↓ renal excretion of sodium
3. Water depletion with concentration of remaining sodium
Normal Serum Sodium
Proportional gain or loss of water and sodium
Hyponatremia
1. ↓ sodium intake
2. ↑ sodium loss
3. Accumulation of free water with dilution of sodium
Chloride
Like sodium, there is abundant chloride in the extracellular fluid, while there is a smaller amount
in the intracellular space dependent on the resting potential of the cell. Chloride is the principal
anion filtered by the glomeruli and participates in acid/base balance in addition to being an
important regulator of osmolality. Like sodium, movement of chloride across membranes can
proportional changes in sodium based on gains and losses or fluid shifts. When there is a
disproportionate change in chloride, acid/base status should be evaluated. To determine if the
change in chloride is proportional to that of sodium, a corrected chloride can be calculated
using the formula (Cl)corectea=(Cl) x midrange normal sodium/(Nat). In uncomplicated acicd/base
disorders, chloride will often vary inversely with the serum bicarbonate (also an anion). If this is
not the case, a mixed acid base disorder should be suspected. Methodologic considerations
are similar to those described for sodium. Additionaly, bromide from potassium bromide may
be measured as chloride by some analyzers resulting in artifactual increases in Cl .

2. With a disproportionate change in sodium, consider acid/base disorder, sequestration or

Potassium
Potassium is the major intracellular cation, however serum levels are approximately
equivalent to the extracellular fluid concentration, which is much lower. Therefore, the
majority of potassium is in the cell and is not routinely measured, making serum potassium
concentration a poor indicator of total bocy potassium. Potassium is required for the normal
function of many enzymes and is critical in generating the normal resting cell membrane
potential. Some clinical signs associated with hyper- and hypokalemia are the result of altered
membrane excitability because of changes in the resting potential of cells. Like sodium and
chloride, serum potassium may be measured using ion specific electrode or flame
photometry methods. Also like the other electrolytes, the serum potassium level reflects the
sum of intake and loss, however serum potassium concentration is further modulated by
because of its preclominantly intracellular location. Intracellular shifts of potassium can be
triggered by insulin and catecholamines, while tissue damage can result in the release of 
intracellular potassium. Inorganic acidosis associated with some types of diarrhea or renal
disease may cause hyperkalemia because potassium shifts out of cells to accommodate the

The cumulative effects of abnormalities in intake, excretion, and translocation can result in a

Bicarbonate
Bicarbonate is a major body buffer participating in acid/base homeostasis. It is produced
from water and carbon dioxide by red blood cells, renal tubular cells, and cells in the
stomach lining.
Increased Serum Bicarbonate (alkalosis)
1. Loss of hydrogen ion
2. Gain of bicarbonate
Decreased Serum Bicarbonate (acidosis)
1. Loss or depletion of bicarbonate
2. Increased production of acid
3. Decreased excretion of acid
Anion Gap
measured on the serum biochemical profile. Because electrochemical neutrality must be
achieved, the "anion gap" may be estimated by the difference in measured cations and anions.
Anion gap=([Na+] + [K+]) - ([Cl-] + [HCO3-])
Normal components of the anion gap include negatively charged proteins, organic anions,
phosphates and sulfates. Fluctuations in the serum content of these components can
influence the anion gap, as can accumulation of a variety of anionic organic acids such as
 lactic acid, ketoacids, or metabolites of compounds such as ethylene glycol. Therefore,
increased anion gap often implies acidemia.
Increased Anion Gap
1. Increased production or accumulation of endogenous acids
2. Increased exogeneous anions as a result of toxicity or metabolism of toxic compounds
3. Hyperalbuminemia associated with dehydration
Decreased Anion Gap (nonspecific change that does not often impact clinical
decision making)

Marked hyperchloremia: Physiologic explanations for the abnormality would be difficult to
formulate. Some type of artifact or interference is suspected based on the absence of other
abnormalities. In this case, consultation with clinicians regarding any potential effects of 
treatment revealed that the patient had received a loading dose of potassium bromide used
for his seizure disorder. This was detected by the ion specific electrode as chloride.
Case Summary and Outcome
Continued monitoring was suggested and diagnostic imaging was recommended to rule out
intracranial lesions. The owners elected euthanasia because of cost and guarded prognosis,

phosphorus may be noted in young growing animals, however this goat is mature.
Hypoparathyroidlism should be considered, although the calcium may be decreased in these
patients. If hypoparathyroidism is compatible with the clinical presentation, ionized calcium
may be performed as a superior indicator of the biologically active form of the mineral.
Finally, phosphorus may be released from cells with trauma or necrosis, which appears
possible based on the hyperkalemia, elevated AST, and marked increase in CK.
Rhabdomyolysis and tumor lysis syndrome are two specific conditions in which tissue
destruction may lead to marked hyperphosphatemia.
Hypoproteinemia: Although the total protein is low, both the albumin and globulin levels are
within reference intervals. Because both are at the lower end of the intervals, these values
should be monitored.
Hyperkalemia: This value is extremely high and may be incompatible with life. The
combination of hyperphosphatemia and hyperkalemia may be associated with anuric/oliguric
renal failure, however this patient is not azotemic. Additional clinical history could provide
more information about the potential for urinary obstruction, which is common in goats. As
described above, the concurrent hyperphosphatemia and hyperkalemia can also reflect tissue
levels in the serum of some species or breeds characterized by red blood cells with high
potassium content. latrogenic hyperkalemia may be caused by excessive potassium supple-
mentation, or by treatment with potassium sparing diuretics, drugs that inhibit the renin-
associated with diabetes mellitus because of failure of insulin mediated uptake of potassium
by cells. Hypoaldosteronism prevents adequate renal elimination of potassium, and some
gastrointestinal disorders are characterized by potassium accumulation.
Increased ALP: Increased ALP may be associated with hepatobiliary disease, however the
normal GGT makes this less likely. In this case, bone pathology or intestinal pathology also
could be considered, and it was later determined that this goat had undergone an
orthopedic surgical procedure prior to death.
Increased CK: The massive increase in this enzyme suggests severe muscle damage.
Increased Anion Gap: Increases in unmeasured anions may be due to poor tissue perfusion
or from release from damaged tissue.

less clear in Zinger, however, since the renal disease itself could have resulted in failure of
renal excretion of phosphorus and potassium and the elevation in CK.

Case 3 - Level 1
"Serengeti" is an 8-year-old intact male German Shepherd presenting with a history of eating
garbage many days ago. Since then, Serengeti has been vomiting once a day, and has been
anorexic and lethargic. He had diarrhea the day he ate the garbage, but after that has had
no feces and has been straining to defecate. He was treated with antibiotics yesterday. On
physical examination, Serengeti has a pendulous abdomen and muscle wasting with a
prominent spine. He is extremely depressed with increased respiratory rate. An oral
examination is not possible because, despite his depression, Serengeti still has the energy to
try to bite. His owners are concerned about cost of medical care.

Interpretation
CBC: Serengeti has a mature neutrophilic leukocytosis and lymphopenia compatible with a
corticosteroid response. Mild concurrent inflammation is also possible due to the
inflammatory nature of the abdominal fluid; however no toxic changes or left shift are noted
at this time. Serengeti is also polycythemic. In this case, a history of vomiting and diarrhea
with poor food intake is compatible with dehydration and a relative polycythemia.

diarrhea and third space sequestration with abdominal fluid accumulation obscured the
effects of dehydration. Polycythemia may also occur as a rare neoplastic condition with
autonomous proliferation of erythroid precursors (polycythemia vera) or may occur in
Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyponatremia and hypochloremia: Likely sources of electrolyte loss in this patient include
losses from the gastrointestinal intestinal tract and third space sequestration in the
abdominal cavity effusion. If hypertonic fluids are lost, this will ead to relatively greater losses
of electrolytes than water, resulting in low serum electrolytes. When isotonic fluids containing
proportional amounts of water and electrolytes are lost, fluid losses are frequently replaced
by water consumed by the patient, further diluting remaining electrolytes. Disproportionate
decreases in chloride (the corrected chloride is 99 mEq/L) are compatible with vomiting or
fluid sequestration. Currently, there are no abnormalities in the serum bicarbonate, although
it is approaching the upper limit of the reference interval. Serum chloride and bicarbonate

significant lowering ot serum sodium and chloride.
Hyperkalemia: Hypoadrenocorticism should be considered, given the combination of
hyperkalemia, hyponatremia and hypochloremia in this patient. The corticosteroid leukogram
would be unusual in a patient with adrenal insufficiency, while the history of gastrointestinal
signs and weakness is compatible with Addison's disease. Some types of gastrointestinal
disease or effusions may also be associated with the electrolyte pattern seen in Serengeti.
The mechanism is not always clear, but it is speculated that volume depletion and low renal
tubular flow rates may contribute to the development of hyperkalemia. Unless there is
impaired renal excretion, increased intake of potassium rarely causes hyperkalemia, although
this may be seen if intravenous fluids are administered that contain excessive amounts of
336 Manual of Veterinary Clinical Chemisty: A Case Study Approach
potassium. Treatment with beta-blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors
interferes with potassium excretion in the absence of renal disease. There is no evidence of
tissue trauma or acid/base abnormalities that would trigger translocation of potassium from
cells. In the context of the clinical history, uroabdomen seems unlikely, however measurement
of abdominal fluid creatinine could be performed to rule out this possibility.
Case Summary and Outcome
Serengeti's owners elected euthanasia because of financial concerns and the potential for
incurable disease. The clinical impression was that Serengeti's effusion may have been due to
neoplasia, possibly carcinomatosis, however a primary mass could not be identified at
necropsy (Figure 7-1). Other findings at necropsy included membranoproliferative glomeru-
lonephritis (apparently subclinical, although no urinalysis was performed), choleliths, benign
neovascularization, necrosis, inflammation, and prominent atypical mesothelial cells. The
anatomic pathologist felt that this lesion was most likely related to a previous penetrating
wound of the gastrointestinal tract, however no injury or septic focus could be located.
This case illustrates two important principles. The first is that electrolyte abnormalities
classically associated with hypoadrenocorticism (see Chapter 5, Case 23; Chapter 6, Case 13;
Chapter 7 Case 3) or uroabdomen (Chapter 5, Case 18; Chapter 7, Cases 12 and 21) may
occur secondary to cavity effusions or gastrointestinal disease. The second is the difficulty
distinguishing reactive hyperplasia from neoplasia in tissues that are predisposed to marked
reactive changes. The final dliagnosis in this case remained uncertain despite necropsy.

Case 4 - Level 1
"Cinder" is an 8-year-old neutered male Labrador Retriever presenting for progressive
lethargy, anorexia, and vomiting. Last month, the owners noticed that he had difficulty
getting up and down the stairs, so the referring veterinarian recommended aspirin. Cinder
began vomiting when he was treated with aspirin, so the medication was changed to
carprofen, which seemed to work better. Two weeks ago, Cinder became anorectic and has
not been drinking much water. This morning he was very weak, began to vomit, and have
diarrhea. On physical examination, Cinder's mucous membranes are markedly icteric, and he
is salivating. Capillary refill time and auscultation are normal. He does appear to be ataxic
and very weak.

Interpretation
CBC: Cinder has a mature neutrophilic leukocytosis and lymphopenia compatible with
corticosteroid effects with or without mild inflammation. The cause for nucleated erythrocytes
in this case is difficult to ascertain. Increased nucleated RBCs may accompany a regenerative
response, however, Cinder is not anemic. Nucleated RBCs may be present in the circulation
in association with endothelial cell damage or lesions in hematopoietic tissues such as the
bone marrow or spleen (Figure 7-2). They may also be seen in cases of lead intoxication.
When present in sufficient numbers, schistocytes indicate vascular pathology such as
disseminated intravascular coagulation (possible with the prolonged coagulation times and
slightly increased FDPs) or hemangiosarcoma, although they may also be noted with more
benign conditions such as iron deficiency.

showing nucleated red blood cell.
Serum Biochemical Profile
Low BUN: Low BUN often reflects polyuria and polydipsia with increased renal tubular flow
rates, however Cinder's clinical history does not include PU/PD. Low protein diets may also
contribute. Alternatively, decreased liver function can lower BUN. Other abnormalities of the
serum biochemical profile that sometimes accompany poor liver function include hypoglycemia,
hypoalbuminemia, and hypocholesterolemia. While all of these analytes are at the lower end of 
their reference intervals, none are low at this time. Examination of other laboratory data shows
Since none of these parameters are good indicators of liver function, measurement of blood
ammonia or serum bile acids is recommended. Ammonia would be preferred when there is
concurrent hyperbilirubinemia, because serum bile acid concentrations are expected to increase
with cholestasis regardless of liver function.

Hypoproteinemia with hypoglobulinemia: Hypoglobulinemia is most often associated with
remains within the reference intervals, although the abnormal coagulation profile suggests
failure of globulin production, but this is unlikely in an 8-year-old dog.
Hypokalemia: Gastrointestinal losses of potassium coupled with inadequate intake combine
to cause Cinder's hypokalemia.
and could not account for all of the increase in bilirubin. The other major differential diagnosis
for hyperbilirubinemia is cholestasis, which is corroborated by the increased ALP, although this
change is mild and not accompanied by an increase in GGT. Decreased liver function and sepsis
may also cause increased serum bilirubin. Because of the low BUN and prolonged clotting
times, the potential for clecreased liver function deserves further consideration.
Mildly increased ALP: There are many extrahepatic causes for increased ALP in the dog,
considerations include bone disease, endocrinopathies, and cholestatic liver disease. The
clinical history does not indicate a high degree of suspicion of bone disease, nor is the other
laboratory work compatible with endocrinopathies implicated in causing elevated ALP such
as hyperadrenocorticism or diabetes mellitus. Cholestatic liver disease seems logical given
the marked increase in bilirubin, however the minor elevation in ALP and normal GGT seem
inordinatelylowforcholestaticliverdisease.
Increased ALT and AST: ALT generally suggests hepatocellular damage, but does not
indicate cause. AST is less liver specific and can reflect more generalized tissue damage,
especially if the ALT does not change proportionally. Hepatocellular damage could be

Coagulation profile: PT and APTT indicate a defect of secondary hemostasis. Common
moderately increased fibrin degradation products because of either failure of clearance by a
cysfunctional liver or increased production associated with excessive breakdown of blood clots.
Case Summary and Outcome
Cinder's blood ammonia levels were within reference intervals. Because treatment with
carprofen has been associated with acute hepatic necrosis in dogs (MacPhail), a toxicity was
bleeding. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a small, bright liver suggesting a chronic process
documented on the serum biochemical profile. Autolysis precluded evaluation for acute
necrosis and documentation of any role for the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory treatment in

the progression of hepatic disease. In this case, the relatively minor elevations in both
cholestatic and hepatocellular enzymes may have reflected the small amount of residual
hepatic tissue.
Cinder's only electrolyte abnormality was isolated hypokalemia, which is relatively common in
domestic animal species with gastrointestinal disease because of the combination of
increased losses and decreased intake, but may also be seen with polyuria and anorexia for
similar reasons (Chapter 3, Case19).

Serum Biochemical Profile
Hypoglycemia: If this finding is verified by repeat analysis to rule out processing errors,
associated with poor nutrition, and some sources indicate that small dogs are more prone to
develop hypoglycemia secondary to decreased food intake. In most cases, however, food
deprivation must be chronic and severe to cause hypoglycemia. Decreased production
associated with liver failure is possible, however other analytes produced by the liver such as
urea, albumin, and cholesterol remain within reference intervals at this time. Sepsis is another
potential cause for hypoglycemia, but not supported by changes on the leukogram.
Neoplasia is also a consideration in an older patient.

converting enzyme inhibitor may potentiate losses of sodium or chloride and promote
renin angiotensin system should have their serum electrolytes periodically monitored and the
dose adjusted if necessary.
Increased ALP: As discussed in Chapter 2, increased ALP in the dog is a nonspecific change
that may be associated with drug effects, endocrinopathies, circulatory disorders, bone
pathology, and cholestatic liver disease. Severe cholestatic liver disease is less likely with a
normal bilirubin and GGT, and the history does not suggest a bone disorder, so
drug/endocrine effects or milder liver disease (possibly secondary to intestinal pathology) are
most likely in this patient.
Increased ALT: Although this is a mild elevation, it does indicate the potential for
hepatocellular damage and suggests that the increased ALP may reflect some hepatic
disease. The liver damage still may be secondary to intestinal inflammation, since liver
Endocrinopathies may cause increases in multiple hepatic enzymes.

such as pancreatitis. This certainly could be compatible with Fiero's clinical history, although
the clinical chemistry abnormalities are not classic for pancreatitis. Alternatively, serum
amylase may also increase in association with intestinal disease, which may be the case in this
patient. Two to three-fold increases in amylase can be the result of decreased glomerular
pre-renal decreases in glomerular filtration rate.
Case Summary and Outcome
Abdominal radiographs showed foreign material in the pylorus and proximal duodenum.
Thoracic radiographs were unremarkable. Fiero was stabilied with fluids prior to surgery for
the removal of the foreign material, which turned out to be plastic food wrapping. Because
of her liver enzyme elevations, liver biopsy samples were collected at the time of gastrotomy.
Microscopic examination revealed chronic active peri-portal hepatitis that was interpreted to
be secondary to the recent history of gastrointestinal disease. Steroid hepatopathy was
superimposed on the inflammatory process and may have accounted for the relatively
pronounced elevation in ALP compared to the other liver enzymes. Although corticosteroids
had not been prescribed for Fiero, increased endogenous steroids could have contributed to
the hepatopathy. The owners also stated that she may have inadvertently been given

levels of endogenously produced steroids due to her illness. Concurrent inflammation could
contribute to the mature neutrophilic leukocytosis. No toxic change or left shift are described
at this time, however these changes are not always present with inflammatory disease.
Serum Biochemical Profile
 Diabetes mellitus could be compatible with the clinical signs, although abdominal pain is not 
Elevated BUN with normal creatinine: The urine specific gravity suggests adequate urinary
concentrating ability. BUN may increase prior to creatinine with decreased tubular flow rates
associated with dehydration. Sepsis may also cause an increase in BUN with no
corresponding change in creatinine. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage or a high protein diet can
elevate BUN but the latter is unlikely in patient unable to eat.
Hypermagnesemia: Given the dehydration, this abnormality likely reflects pre-renal
decreases in glomerular filtration rate.
Manual of Veterinary Clinical Chemisty: A Case Study Approach
dietary in origin even during periods of anorexia. Hyponatremia generally reflects a relative
gain of water compared to sodium and chloride or excessive loss of electrolytes. The patho-
 physiology of Francesca's hyponatremia likely involves both mechanisms. She is experiencing
gastrointestinal losses of electrolytes associated with vomiting and diarrhea. In response to
the volume depletion, glomerular filtration rate declines. This results in increased isosmostic
reabsorption of sodium in the proximal tubule and decreased fluid flow in the distal tubules,
impairing water excretion. In addition, volume depletion will encourage release of
antidiuretic hormone, leading to further impairment in water excretion. Lastly, fluid losses are
often replaced with consumption of water because of increased thirst (note Francesca is
polydipsic), further diluting electrolyte levels in the circulation. Vomiting of the contents of
the proximal gastrointestinal tract associated with structural or functional obstruction is
associated with excessive loss of chloride (HCl), causing a hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis.
Hypokalemia: Francesca's low serum potassium is caused by inadequate intake to
alkalosis is compatible with vomiting of stomach contents or diuretic use, while hypokalemia
in association with metabolic acidosis is more frequently attributable to small intestinal
diarrhea, chronic renal failure, or distal renal tubular acidosis.
Increased HCO3 (alkalemia): Loss of hydrogen in addition to electrolytes because of the
vomiting of anterior gastrointestinal tract contents is causing the alkalosis.
Increased anion gap: Alkalosis and dehydration are potential causes for the increased anion
associated with dehydration and poor tissue perfusion. Blood gas analysis may be indicated
to follow the acid/base status of this patient.
Case Summary and Outcome
Francesca was taken to surgery and a corn cob was removed from her proximal small
intestine. The owners observed that it may have originated from a recently melted snow man
their children had made in the yard. Francesca was discharged and had an uneventful
recovery at home. Note that both Francesca and Fiero (this chapter, Case 5) had a history of
vomiting associated with foreign body ingestion with evidence of hypochloremia and
metabolic alkalosis, however Francesca had more pronounced electrolyte abnormalities. This 
is probably the result of Francesca's more protracted clinical course prior to surgical
correction of the small intestinal blockage, although in theory, Fiero's angiotensin converting
enzyme inhibitor treatment could have helped maintain her serum potassium levels. Despite
Francesca's more serious clinical signs, there are no liver enzyme elevations that suggest

mEq/L), which may be observed in patients taking furosemide. Replacement of fluids and
electrolytes lost through the gastrointestinal tract with oral water intake can dilute remaining
serum electrolytes. Congestive heart failure will evoke mechanisms of renal fluid retention
and increased thirst to increase intravascular water in an attempt to restore circulation to
dilute remaining serum electrolytes.
Hypokalemia: Similar to sodium and chloride, some types of diuretics cause renal potassium
wasting. This drain on potassium may be compounded by gastrointestinal losses and low intake.

function seems less likely because the BUN, glucose, and albumin are normal and the
cholesterol is increased. Serum bile acids would be a more sensitive way to evaluate liver
function deficits.
Increased ALP: As described above, markedly increased ALP is suggestive for cholestatic
disease, which would be supported by an increased GGT if available. There are numerous
potential causes for elevated ALP including some medications and endocrinopathies such as
diabetes or hyperadrenocortocism, which are not consistent with the history, physical
examination findings, and other clinical chemistry data.
Increased ALT and AST: Elevations in these enzymes indicate hepatocellular damage,
although muscle damage also could contribute to the increases. A creatine kinase
measurement could help cetermine if concurrent muscle damage is occurring.
Case Summary and Outcome
Abdominal ultrasound revealed a small liver, a moderate sized gall bladder with no evidence
of blockage, and a hypoechoic, slightly enlarged pancreas. Biopsy of the liver showed chronic
active hepatitis with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate, piece-meal necrosis, and moderate
portal fibrosis. Food was withheld from Snow due to the vomiting, and she was treated with
antibiotics, fluids and gastrointestinal protectants. When she was eventually fed, she
protein diet was implemented and ursodeoxycholic acid and actulose were added to her
treatment plan. A cardiology consult was requested by the owner, and Snow was found to
have 4+ mitral regurgitation and mild tricuspid regurgitation without evidence of heart failure
and excellent contractility. Cardiology recommended changing the treatment of her cardiac
disease to an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor with furosemide as needed to control
clinical signs once her liver disease was better controlled. Eight weeks after discharge, Snow
was re-evaluated and was doing very well with no clinical signs of liver disease and a normal
serum bilirubin. The owners had noted an increase in her coughing, however radiographic
evaluation showed clear lung fields and reduced heart size compared to her last evaluation.
Snow's case demonstrates the interaction between the effects of medication and multiple
disease processes. Like Fiero (Chapter 7, Case 5), the diuretic therapy may have potentiated
the development of electrolyte abnormalities associated with vomiting and anorexia. Patients
taking medications that could influence electrolyte homeostasis should have their serum
electrolyte levels monitored periodically. In some cases, doses of medications must be
adjusted or alternative therapies instituted in response to laboratory abnormalities.

Case Summary and Outcome
Delaney's septic abdomen was treated by placement of indwelling abdominal drains and
serial abdominal lavages. Later, both jugular veins dleveloped thromboses and Delaney's
350  Mamual of Veterinary Clinical Chemisty: A Case Sudy Approach
abdominal incisions became infected. Despite these complications, her serum biochemical
profiles normalized and she responded well to treatment. She was discharged on antibiotic
therapy and with a wound care plan to complete her recovery at home.
Delaney experienced loss of water in excess of electrolytes, leading to increased serum
electrolyte concentrations. Replacement of this water with appropriate intravenous fluids or
even just increased oral water intake can correct the imbalances. Sometimes water loss alone
or even restricted access to water leads to increased serum electrolytes (See Chapter 5, Case
1). Delaney can be compared with previous cases (6, 7) in which the relative losses of water
and electrolytes were reversed and excess water was consumed or retained. This illustrates
the importance of considering water balance in addition to electrolyte balance when
interpreting serum electrolyte data.

Interpretation
A CBC was not done.
Serum Biochemical Profile
Azotemia with isosthenurina: Failure to concentrate urine in an animal with increased BUN
and creatinine is compatible with renal azotemia. Although the hydration status was not
specifically evaluated, Humphrey's azotemia may be complicated by pre-renal factors.
Hyperphosphatemia: This is most likely due to decreased glomerular filtration rate resulting
in tailure ot the kidney to eliminate phosphorus.
Hypoproteinemia: Serum albumin and globulin are within the reference intervals, however,
they are both at the lower end of normal resulting in a lower total protein. Because the serum
albumin is at the lower limit of the reference interval, decreased production or increased
losses ot albumin are possible. Although the dipstick evaluation ot protein in the urine was
negative, further evaluation of the dilute urine by performing a urine protein:creatinine ratio
would be more sensitive. Decreased liver function also may result in decreased production of
albumin, but additional tests would be needed to evaluate this possibility. Failure to eliminate
Hyponatremia and hypochloremia with normal HcO3: The decrease in chloride is slightly
low serum values, the diagnostic focus is on increased losses, including gastrointestinal, renal,
third space, and cutaneous. Humphrey's damaged kidneys likely cannot regulate sodium
balance, which could lead to increased renal losses. This could be quantified by performing a
urinary fractional excretion of sodium. Disproportional losses of chloride may be related to
acid/base abnormalities, however the serum bicarbonate is currently within the reference
intervals. Blood gas analysis is needed to uncover a mixed acid/base abnormality when the
chloride and bicarbonate do not vary inversely as they typically do.
Hyperkalemia: Polyuric renal failure is often associated with hypokalemia, because the rena
tubular flow rate of remaining functional nephrons is high, promoting kaliuresis. In contrast,
anuric/oliguric renal failure is often accompanied by hyperkalemia because of low single
is cellular translocation associated with profound tissue trauma, both of which are unlikely in
this case.
Case Summary and Outcome
laboratory abnormalities did not improve, and he produced progressively smaller amounts of
urine over time. Because of his poor response to therapy and the likely chronic and
irreversible nature of his disease, Humphrey was euthanized. At necropsy, Humphrey's tissues
were dliffusely edematous, suggesting fluid retention and the inability of his kidneys to
eliminate a fluid load. Tubulointerstitial nephritis, fibrosis, and mineralization were evident in
both kidneys. The lesions were worse in the right kidney, which had severe degeneration of
remaining tubules. The cause of the renal failure could not be determined due to the chronic
nature of the lesions.
Electrolyte abnormalities associated with renal disease may be quite variable depending on
fluid and food intake, use of medications, other concurrent disease processes, and the stage
of renal failure (polyuric vs. oliguric/anuric). Although not emphasized in this book, many
animals with chronic renal disease who are eating well and have access to water will have
352 Manual of Veterinary Clinical Chemisty: A Case Study Aproach
normal serum electrolyte levels. Obstruction of urine flow, uroabdomen, or anuric renal
failure are often associated with hyperkalemia (Chapter 5, Cases 7, 9, 18). In contrast,
patients with polyuric renal failure are predisposed to hypokalemia, particularly if they are
anorexic (Chapter 5, Case 10) or have concurrent third space or gastrointestinal losses
(Chapter 5, Case 11, 20). Marked and potentially dangerous fluctuations in serum potassium
may occur in renal failure patients that undergo rapid changes in glomerular filtration rates
associated with relief of severe dehydration or urinary blockage. Alterations in serum sodium
and chloride with renal failure are somewhat less predictable than potassium and reflect
changes in these electrolytes relative to water. Note that because of fluctuations in water as
well as electrolytes and the potential for cellular translocation, serum electrolytes values are
not reliable indicators of total body electrolyte stores. Damaged kidneys may be somewhat
less able to excrete a sodium load, or to conserve sodium (Chapter 5, Cases 15, 17, 19).
Note that the pattern of hyponatremia, hypochloremia, and hyperkalemia was present in a
patient with abdominal effusion (Serengeti, Chapter 7, Case 3), and could be compatible with
poorly concentrated urine for their degree of dehydration (See Chapter 5, Case 23 and
Astra, Chapter 7, Case 13), it may be very difficult to distinguish renal failure from hypoad-
renocorticism based on electrolyte abnormalities alone. In Humphrey's case, age and species
prioritized renal disease over an endocrinopathy.

Interpretation
CBC: Darla is lymphopenic, which suggests corticosteroid effects, although there is no
mature neutrophilia or monocytosis. Lymphopenia is one of the most consistent features of
the corticosteroid leukogram, while other characteristic changes are not always present.
Decreased lymphocyte counts may also be the result of viral mediated lysis or loss via the
gastrointestinal tract.
The hematocrit is low normal, while the red blood cell count and hemoglobin are decreased.
Darla has evidence of hemorrhage including hematuria and hypoproteinemia, as well as
clinical signs which could be related to anemia such as weakness, tachycardlia, and tachypnea.
Therefore, even though her hematocrit is within the reference interval, it may not be
"normal". Although baseline data was not available for Darla, a rapid drop in hematocrit
from the upper end of the reference interval to the lower end could have significant
physiological effects. While clinical signs may be related to the degree of anemia, they also
reflect the rate of decrease in erythrocyte mass. Also, keep in mind that following acute
hemorrhage, it may take up to 24 hours to manifest the full decrease in PCV and total

affecting calcium metabolism, nor is there evidence of pancreatic or gastrointestinal disease.
Hypoproteinemia with hypoalbuminemia and low-normal globulins: Low protein values are
associated with both increased losses and decreased production. In this case, we are already
suspicious of blood loss. There is no evidence of other routes of protein loss such as third
space fluid accumulation, skin lesions, or gastrointestinal disease at this time. Because serum
albumin is relatively lower than serum globulin levels, selective glomerular loss of albumin is
possible. A urinalysis could be performed to quantify protein loss in the urine, however this
test will not dlistinguish proteinuria due to glomerular lesions from protein associated with
hematuria originating in other parts of the urinary tract. In these cases, it is often most
nephropathy. Decreased production of protein, predominantly albumin, can be the result of
starvation but requires prolonged or severe food deprivation and poor body condition would
be evident. Liver failure may also result in decreased synthesis of albumin. Although two liver
enzymes are elevated, most analytes on the routine clinical chemistry panel that reflect liver
function appear to be within reference intervals (BUN, glucose, and cholesterol). Because
354 Mamual of Veterinary Clinical Chemistry: A Case Study Approach
these analytes are neither sensitive nor specific indicators of liver function, serum bile acids
or blood ammonia measurements should be performed in patients with suspected liver
failure. Albumin is a negative acute phase reactant, and its production may be
inflammation on the CBC.
Hyponatremia with proportional hypochloridemia: Both increased osses and dilution are
likely factors contributing to low serum sodium and chloride. Hemorrhage results in loss of
electrolytes proportional to the loss of fluid. Like the fall in PCV and total protein,
water by drinking and as hypotension results in the retention of free water by the kidney due
to the action of antidiuretic hormone. Similar mechanisms also may occur when fluids are lost
via the gastrointestinal tract, skin, kidney, or into third spaces. Retention of free water can
dilute sodium and chloride during pregnancy or congestive heart failure, while the osmotic
effects of hyperglycemia can draw water into the circulation from the extravascular space in
diabetic patients. Low sodium and chloride are rarely the result of dietary deficiency in smal
animal patients on commercial diets, even if there is a history of anorexia
abnormalities in sodium and chloride. There is loss of potassium due to hemorrhage with
hypokalemia.
Increased HCO3: Alkalemia may be associated with the hyperventilation as excessive carbon
dioxide is lost when Darla increases her respiratory rate to compensate for the developing
anemia and hypoxia.
Mildly increased ALP: There are many extrahepatic causes for increased ALP in the dog.
including corticosteroid effects which are suggested by the lymphopenia. This abnormality is
mild and not accompanied by a change in GGT, so a thorough medication history should be
taken to rule out drug induction. Other considerations include bone disease,
endocrinopathies, and cholestatic liver disease. Liver disease is unlikely with the normal GGT
and bilirubin. This analyte should be re-evaluated and further work-up is indicated if the
increases are persistent or increasing over time. Chapter 2 may be consulted for a complete
discussion of hepatic and extrahepatic causes of increased ALP.
In Darla's case, hypoperfusion or poor oxygenation of the liver should be considered as a
potential cause for hepatocyte damage. Because the ALP also is elevated, primary liver
disease cannot be ruled out. Repeat serum biochemical profile after Darla's anemia is
addressed will help determine the appropriate clinical course.

may also cause hypophosphatemia, however these conditions generally are associated with
hypercalcemia, while Isis has hypocalcemia.

degree of hyponatremia (82 x 146/132), it becomes 90.7, still significantly below the
reference interval. Increased losses of sodium and chloride may be occurring through the skin
because of the degloving injury. Because diuretic therapy is being used, further sodium
angiotensin system stimulates increased proximal tubular reabsorption of sodium and water.
Because of this, less fluid arrives at the distal parts of the tubule responsible for free water
excretion. In addition, non-osmotic stimulation of antidiuretic hormone release further impairs
water excretion, leading to dilution of electrolytes in the plasma. Diuretics like furosemide
inhibit chloride reabsorption and can slightly increase bicarbonate as well. Hypochloremia is
associated with alkalosis.

associated with renin-angiotensin system activation. Inadequate delivery of sodium to the
distal tubule can predispose to kaliuresis, and diuretic use will exacerbate renal losses of
potassium. The diuretic efect may be worse in cats than other species and is more
pronounced if electrolyte intake is decreased because of anorexia.
Increased HCO3 (alkalemia): The effects of the diuretic therapy and chloride depletion
contribute to the increased HCO3. Because of the potential for concurrent respiratory issues in
this patient, a blood gas analysis may provide further information about the acid/base status.
Increased AST: This abnormality is mild and probably reflects tissue damage associated with
perfusion deficits.
Hyperamylasemia: Increased serum amylase in this case is attributed to decreased
glomerular filtration rate. Concurrent pancreatic disease cannot be ruled out, however
amylase is not a good indicator ot pancreatitis in cats.

Case Summary and Outcome
Intravenous fluid treatment was discontinued and Isis was treated with diuretics to correct the
fluid load that was thought to have precipitated the congestive heart failure. She responded
well and ultimately recovered from her wound. Various diuretics influence electrolyte
homeostasis (See Snow, Chapter 7, Case 7), so the specific medication should be chosen
carefully and serum electrolyte values should be monitored.
This case is similar to Darla (Chapter 7, Case 10), who was experiencing isotonic fluid losses
that were replaced with water, leading to low serum electrolyte concentrations. Isis's
electrolyte abnormalities were further complicated by intravascular volume expansion due to
iatrogenic fluid overload and secondary heart failure.

cycles of antibiotic treatment. At that time, abdominal radiographs were unremarkable. Two
months ago, the hematuria recurred but dlid not resolve despite prolonged antibiotic therapy.
Four days ago, Weasel was presented for further work up for the hematuria. The owners
noted that Weasel does not appear to strain, but will urinate, move a few feet, and then
urinate a smaller amount which is usually bloodier than the initial urine. He seems to be
urinating at the same frequency as he always has. Other than the hematuria, he seemed to
be normal and healthy. On physical examination, Weasel appeared well hydrated with normal
vital signs and auscultation. However, he was tense on abdominal palpation, and abdominal
ultrasound revealed a mass along the ventral aspect of the bladder wall close to the neck.
Surgical removal of the mass was scheduled for the following week. However, Weasel's
condition deteriorated over the past 4 days, and he returned to the hospital due to lethargy.

Interpretation
CBC: Weasel has a mature neutrophilic leukocytosis and a lymphopenia compatible with a

Hyperglycemia: Both endogeneous and exogenous corticosteroids can cause hyperglycemia.
Diabetes mellitus should also be considered. Diabetic patients may present with signs of
urinary tract dlisease because of polyuria/polydipsia or concurrent urinary tract infections,
however the dlegree of hyperglycemia is mild at this time.

cannot be ruled out at this point, however the clinical history does not include a clear
hyperproteinemia are not present. Renal failure is possible, however the presence of a mass in
the urinary bladder suggests a post-renal cause for azotemia. The recent onset of abdominal
distention could be compatible with a ruptured urinary bladder. Weasel has melena and
digestion of blood in the intestinal track that may contribute to a mild increase in BUN.
Hyperphosphatemia: This abnormality is due to failure of elimination of phosphorus in the
kidney.
Hypermagnesemia: Like phosphorus, retention of magnesium is attributed to failure of
elimination through the kidney.

corrected chloride is 98 mEq/L, so not all of the decrease in chloride may be accounted for
by forces acting on sodium concentration. Given the distended abdomen, third space loss of
both electrolytes is likely, and inability to eliminate water in the urine can cause dilutional
hypotension or low plasma osmolality. Vomiting may contribute to chloride loss. Corrected
hypochloremia is typically associated with alkalosis, however Weasel has a low bicarbonate
and increased anion gap compatible with a metabolic acidosis, therefore a mixed acid/base
disorder is suspected. A blood gas analysis will further characterize the acid/base status.

to a large number of extrahepatic influences, including metabolic and hormonal disorders.

absence of primary liver disease, including in response to corticosteroids. Elevations in AST
are less liver-specific than ALT.
Hypercholesterolemia: Because dogs are have a predominance of high density lipoproteins,
hypercholesterolemia is unlikely to cause clinical disease but is often used as an indicator of
disease (possible because of the hyperbilirubinemia and elevated liver enzymes), and renal
disease (possible because of the azotemia). Post-prandial effects should be considered, but
Weasel has been anorectic
Hyperamylasemia: The change in this analyte is less than two-fold, thus may be explained by
decreased glomerular filtation rate. Pancreatic or intestinal pathology may also contribute
predominance of neutrophils suggests suppurative inflammation, which appears to be sterile
at this time. Consideration should be given to chemical peritonitis such as uroabdomen (most
likely) or bile peritonitis (less likely with clinical history and absence of bile pigment).
Comparision of abdominal fluid and serum creatinine measurements can help confirm the
presence of urine in the abdomen.
360Mamual of Veterinary Clinical Chemisty: A Case Study Approach
Case Summary and Outcome
Weasel was sent to surgery for abdominal lavage and surgical correction of suspected urinary
bladder rupture. Four liters of urine were removed from his abdomen at surgery and a liver
biopsy was collected to investigate the potential for liver disease suggested by the liver
positive contrast cystogram revealed urinary bladder leakage through the ventral bladder wall.
He went back to surgery, where one liter of serosanguinous fluid was removed and a puncture
wound was repaired that was assumed to be the result of stay sutures or the needle used to
leak test the incision. Weasel recovered well, and was discharged on piroxicam for the
transitional cell carcinoma that was diagnosed by cytology of his bladder mass.
Weasel's data should be compared with Sloop's (Chapter 5, Case 18). Sloop also had a
diagnosis of uroabdomen, with a distended abdomen, azotemia, hyperphosphatemia,
hyponatremia, hypochloridemia and increased anion gap. Unlike Weasel, Sloop was
hyperkalemic and had normal serum bicarbonate compared with Weasel's acidemia. This
variation reflects the interindividual differences that often occur between individuals with
of urine for a more prolonged period, leading to accumulation of greater amounts of
potassium, while Weasel is less able to compensate for the developing acidosis. Weasel's
that Weasel has underlying renal disease that interferes with renal regulation of acid/base
status, although differences in the pre-renal contribution to azotemia may also influence the
data. It should be noted that the degree of azotemia does not correlate with glomerular
filtration rate in a linear fashion, and direct comparison of glomerular filtration rates between
individual animals using the BUN and serum creatinine is problematic (see the introduction to
Chapter 5 for further discussion of interpretation of BUN and serum creatinine).

Interpretation
CBC: There is a mild lymphocytosis with no associated morphologic abnormalities. This may
be attributable to the effects of epinephrine. Alternatively, antigenic stimulation can
increased lymphocyte numbers in the circulation. This interpretation would be strengthened
if reactive lymphocytes were present. Lymphoid neoplasia could be considered but is less
with appropriate history and serum biochemical data can suggest hypoadrenocortism.
There is a mild normocytic anemia with evidence of hemolysis. Because erythropoiesis never
results in excessive hemoglobin content in cells, the increase in MCHC is interpreted to be
artifactual and related to the hemolysis. It cannot be determined whether the hemolysis is in
vitro or in vivo, however the presence of small numbers of schistocytes and spherocytes is
mediated damage to erythrocytes. Less frequent causes include zinc toxicity, snake or bee
envenomation, and erythrocyte metabolic abnormalities. In small numbers, this finding may

leukogram to suggest inflammation.
Serum Biochemical Profile
Azotemia: Astra's urine is not optimally concentrated, suggesting that there may be a renal
cause for the azotemia, although a pre-renal component is almost certainly superimposed.

nesemia, hyperamylasemia, and possibly the hyperkalemia. Before renal azotemia can be
confirmed, other extra-renal causes of poor urinary concentrating ability should be
considered. Liver failure is unlikely given the normal bilirubin, cholesterol and high BUN,
however the albumin is low. Serum bile acids or blood ammonia are required to confirm liver
dysfunction. Osmotic diuresis is also unlikely with normal urinalysis, and there is no history of
medullary washout is the reason for the poorly concentrated urine, appropriate electrolyte
supplementation and fluid therapy should correct the problem.
Electrolyte and Acid/Base Evaluahion 363
Hyperphosphatemia and hypercalcemia: Renal failure, vitamin D toxicity, and hypoadreno-
corticism can lead to these changes. Both renal failure and hypoadrenocorticism are
compatible with the other laboratory data and in both, inadequate glomerular filtration rate
for elimination of phosphorus leads to its accumulation in the blood. Hypoadrenocorticism is
a cause of hypercalcemia in dogs, but is not associated with increases in ionized calcium and
the increased calcium is therefore not pathogenic. Diminished renal excretion because of
and the calcium level should normalize quickly after initiation of therapy. The most common
cause of hypercalcemia in dogs is hypercalcemia of malignancy, which cannot be ruled out in
this case. Increases in ionized calcium can cause both reversible and irreversible rena
parathyroid hormone (PTH) and parathyroid hormone related protein (PTHrP) can help
differentiate various causes of hypercalcemia, but is not necessary in this case.
Hypermagnesemia: Decreased glomerular filtration rate is the cause for the high
magnesium.
Hypoalbuminemia: Albumin may be decreased because of inadequate production or
low serum albumin. Other laboratory abnormalities that may also occur with poor liver
function are not present (see above), however serum bile acid measurement could be
considered if other explanations for hypoalbuminemia are not applicable. The liver may
decrease albumin production in response to inflammation, however the globulin levels are
not elevated, nor is there evidence of inflammation in the CBC. Nutritional factors are an
loss and is in poor body condition, suggesting that albumin may be low because of 
inadequate protein intake and body stores. Albumin may be diluted in patients with
accumulation of fluid in the circulation, which could also result in hyponatremia and
glucose in the circulation, which is not the case here. Excessive selective loss of albumin from
protein:creatinine ratio may be a better measure of this in a patient with relatively dilute
urine. Nonselective loss of protein into body cavity effusion, via exudative skin lesions, or into
serumglobulin.

and hypochloremia, which are approximately proportional. Given her history, gastrointestinal
losses are possible. The potential for third space and dermal losses should be evaluated in
the context of the clinical information. Renal losses should also be considered, and can be
quantified by performing urinary fractional excretions. Patients with hyponatremia should
have low urinary fractional excretion of sodium as the bocy attempts to conserve the
electrolyte. Normal to increased fractional excretion under these circumstances would be
abnormal and reflect either renal disease or hypoadrenocorticism (lack of aldosterone to
signal the need to conserve sodium by the kidney).

Hyperkalemia: Polyuric renal failure is often associated with hypokalemia because of enhancec
urinary potassium loss. It is only when glomerular filtration is markedly limited or when urine
cannot be eliminated from the body that hyperkalemia ensues. Astra has marked dehydration
and clinical evidence of poor perfusion, including weak femoral pulses and prolonged capillary
because of aldosterone deficiency. Cellular translocation in response to acidosis is also possible,
Decreased anion gap: The low albumin and abnormal electrolyte values may decrease the
anion gap.
Increased AST: This most likely reflects tissue damage secondary to poor perfusion.

glomerular filtration rate. Gastrointestinal disease also can be associated with increased
but is not required to explain this data.
Urinalysis: The bactiuria indicates either contamination or a urinary tract infection.
Case Summary and Outcome
Based on the suspicion of hypoadrenocorticism, an ACTH stimulation test was performed.
Both pre and post-stimulation values were <1.00 μg/dl, compatible with a diagnosis of
antibiotics for the urinary tract intection.
These electrolyte abnormalities are classic for hypoadrenocorticism, however they are not
could potentially have hypoadrenocorticism. In some cases, the absence of any features of
the corticosteroid leukogram despite signs of severe illness may be a clue. Hyponatremia,
hypochloremia and hyperkalemia may also characterize other processes in addition to hypo-
adrenocorticim. These conditions include primary gastrointestinal disease (DiBartola), cavity
effusions (Chapter 7, Case 3) including uroabdomen (Chapter 5, Case 18), or renal failure
(Chapter 7, Case 9). Astra is a good example of extra-renal factors resulting in laboratory
data that could suggest primary renal disease. Astra is azotemic with relatively dilute urine,
hyperphosphatemia, hypermagnesemia, and hyperkalemia. All of these changes may result
from decreased glomerular filtration rate as was the case for Humphrey (Chapter 7, Case 9).
Low sodium and chloride could be attributable to primary renal dysfunction, in which case
urinary fractional excretions of these electrolytes would be high. Typically, appropriate fluid
therapy will correct electrolyte abnormalities and temporarily restore urinary concentrating
ability in patients with hypoadrenocorticism, while patients with renal failure will continue to
produce dilute urine.

Interpretation
CBC: Twix has a leukocytosis with increased band neutrophils, toxic change, and
monocytosis, indicating inflammation (Figure 7-4). The microcytosis may be due to age
associated differences in red blood cell size (Adams). Thrombocytosis is often associated with
inflammation in large animal species.

bovine blood film.
Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: Stress is the most likely explanation for the hyperglycemia, however since
the transition to ruminal digestion does not occur in calves until 3 to 4 weeks of age, serum
glucose levels may be somewhat higher than in the adult.
Azotemia: Twix is mildly azotemic. Without a urine specific gravity, the azotemia is difficult to
classify, however the history and physical examination suggest pre-renal azotemia due to
dehydration.
Hypoproteinemia: Both albumin and globulin levels are within the reference intervals,
making the significance of the low total protein difficult to interpret. Neonatal animals often
have lower serum total protein values because of relatively greater total body water content

be reassessed after fluid deficits are corrected.
Hypernatremia and hyperchloremia: In this case, isotonic or hypotonic fluid losses combined
with supplementation with hypertonic to isotonic fluids leads to relative water deficit and
accumulation of excessive electrolytes. Most patients that have access to water and have
adequate renal function will still be able to regulate serum electrolyte concentrations.
Unfortunately, Twix did not have access to water, but it is likely that she has normal renal
function and the mild azotemia is pre-renal.
Decreased bicarbonate (acidemia): Loss of bicarbonate containing fluids in the diarrhea is
the likely cause of the low bicarbonate.
Increased ALP: While an increase in the ALP could be compatible with hepatobiliary disease,
bone growth in young animals also will elevate this value and complicate interpretation.
Increased GGT: Elevation in serum GGT is a more specific indicator of liver disease in large
animal species than ALP, however it may also be influenced by age-related phenomena such
Electrolyte and Acid/Base Evaluahion 367
as peripartum elevations following colostrum ingestion. In addition, liver damage may occur
secondary to intestinal disease and/or hypoperfusion. The normal SDH suggests that
increases in ALP and GGT may be due to extra-hepatic causes such as bone growth and
colostrum ingestion, respectively. While less likely, it is possible that liver damage occurred
which has a very short serum half life and rapidly decreases after cessation of injury.
Increased AST and CK: These enzyme elevations suggest muscle damage, potentially related
to medical intervention or transport. The AST is less tissue-specific than the CK and could
also be related to hepatocellular damage.
Case Summary and Outcome
Twix was treated with intravenous fluids containing bicarbonate until the acidosis resolved,
then she received oral milk replacer. Sodium and chloride supplementation was gradually
decreased until her electrolyte abnormalities were corrected. She was also treated with
antibiotics. Fecal samples were evaluated for Salmonella, corona virus, rota virus, and
Escherchia coli, and a non-hemolytic E. coli was cultured. Twix responded well to therapy and
was released from the hospital.
Like Delaney (Chapter 7, Case 8), Twix likely experienced loss of hypotonic fluids, leading to
concentration of remaining electrolytes in a smaller volume of intravascular water. Generally,
this will stimulate thirst and water intake, so in both patients, restricted access to water may
have contributed to the electrolyte abnormalities. Loss of isotonic fluids can also result in
hypernatremia and hyperchloridemia if electrolytes are over-supplemented as was the case
for Twix. This is roughly the opposite process that occurred with Darla (Chapter 7, Case10),
water, diluting remaining electrolytes in the blood. These cases show that gains and losses of

with diabetes mellitus. Jason is being treated with insulin, but he has had worsening polyuria
and polydipsia despite increasing doses of insulin. Several weeks ago, hematuria was noted
and Jason was treated with antibiotics. Jason typically has an excellent appetite, but had
been eating less prior to the turkey episode. On presentation to the referring veterinary
practice 2 days ago, mineral opacities were seen on survey radiographs. A subsequent
abdominal exploratory merely revealed an area of ileus, which was evacuated with no
evidence of obstruction. At that time, the liver was enlarged and fatty in appearance. A
biopsy was taken, however no results are yet available. Two days after surgery, Jason was
referred to the teaching hospital because of declining status and inability to maintain
hydration despite fluid therapy. On presentation, Jason appears obtunded, dehydrated and
shocky. He has bilateral diabetic cataracts and a non-painful but doughy abdomen. He has
numerous decubital ulcers, with a large decubital ulcer over his left lateral hock.

Interpretation
CBC: Jason has a moderate neutrophilic leukocytosis with a mild regenerative left shift,
lymphopenia, and monocytosis. Corticosteroid effects could contribute to the increased
mature neutrophils, lymphopenia and monocytosis, while the regenerative left shift suggests
inflammation is also playing a role in the leukogram changes. Jason has a microcytic
hypochromic anemia, which suggests the potential for an iron deficiency anemia, especially in
combination with the thrombocytosis. A portosystemic shunt may be accompanied by
microcytosis but is unlikely with the other clinical and laboratory data. Some Japanese breeds
normally are microcytic (Akita or Shiba Inu).
Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: Although this level of blood glucose is compatible with other causes of
hyperglycemia such as stress, corticosteroid treatment, or pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus is
the most likely cause given Jason's history.
Decreased BUN: The low BUN may be related to the polyuria/polydipsia and increased
tubular flow rates. A low protein diet could contribute. Decreased liver function is possible
given the microcytosis and hypoalbuminemia, however it is not specifically evaluated here.
The creatinine is at the lower limit of the reference interval and may reflect
polyuria/polydipsia or muscle wasting.
Hypocalcemia with normal phosphorus: The low serum albumin may account for some of
the hypocalcemia but will not impact ionized calcium. Laboratory error does occur, so the
test could be repeated to verify the abnormality. Other considerations in this case include
hypoparathyroidism or Vitamin D deficiency are possible, however they are rare and often
associated with hyperphosphatemia, which is not present here. lonized calcium could be
measured to further clarify Jason's calcium status.
Mild hypoalbuminemia: Decreased intake, decreased production or selective losses result in
hypoalbuminemia. Jason has been anorexic with muscle wasting, suggesting that poor
liver function, however further testing is required to assess this possibility. Selective loss of
albumin through the glomerulus could be occurring, and a urinalysis or urine
protein:creatinine ratio should be performed to quantify proteinuria. It is important to
remember that urine protein may be elevated in association with occult urinary tract
infections, which are common in diabetic patients.
when there is a disproportionate deficit of free water and may be associated with hypotonic
fluid losses (renal, gastrointestinal, third space, cutaneous). Restricted access to water alone,
or in concert with the hypotonic losses could also cause these elevations. In Jason's case,
glucose in the urine causes osmotic diuresis and fluid loss. Gastrointestinal fluid losses are
also likely, while no mention is made of an effusion or significant skin disease. Jason's
pressure sores suggest that he was unable to move adequately to drink water, and his access
to water may have been restricted associated with the enterotomy. Intravenous fluid therapy
losses with isotonic fluids could exacerbate the electrolyte excesses.
370 Mamual of Veterinary Clinical Chemisty: A Case Study Approach
Increased CK: The elevated CK may be related to muscle damage from inability to move and
the development of pressure sores. Other potential causes include iatrogenic manipulation
such as surgery and intramuscular injections.
Case Summary and Outcome
Jason was treated with antibiotics and intravenous fluids appropriately adjusted for his
electrolyte abnormalities. He also received insulin and medication to control pain. His
decubital sores were treated and he was frequently repositioned. By the next day, Jason was
able to roll over on his own and was supported to drink small bowls of water every 2 hours.
He was also given frequent small meals. Jason was hospitalized for almost two weeks, but
showing moderately well controlled diabetes. The wound on his left hock was also healing.
but required continuing care at home. The liver biopsy collected at surgery showed fatty
change compatible with the history of diabetes.
Like Twix, the calf in the Case 14, this chapter, fluid losses (renal due to osmotic diuresis in
this case, gastrointestinal in the previous case) combined with restricted access to water led 
to hypernatremia and hyperchloremia. Serum electrolyte data and acid/base status can be
quite variable in diabetic patients depending on food intake, degree of polyuria, and any
reference interval (Hooligan, Chapter 3, Case 20), while other patients may have
hyponatremia and hypochloridemia associated with relative water excess because of the
osmotic effects of hyperglycemia (Marion, Chapter 3, Case 18). It is likely that Hooligan and
Marion had free access to water during their illness.

Hyperglycemia: Given the history of diabetes mellitus, the hyperglycemia is attributed to this
previously diagnosed condition. Exacerbation by stress cannot be ruled out.
Mild azotemia: Increased BUN and creatinine indicate a decrease in glomerular filtration
rate. However, ruling out a potential renal component of azotemia in diabetic patients can be
complicated by the osmotic diuresis caused by the presence of glucose and ketones in the
urine, which prevent proper concentration of urine by normally functional kidneys. Some
degree of pre-renal azotemia is also expected.
372
Manual of Veterinary Clinical Chemisry: A Case Study Approach
Hyperphosphatemia: Phosphorus is not being eliminated at normal rates because of the
decreased glomerular filtration rate.
Hypocalcemia: The cause for the mild decrease in total serum calcium is not apparent here
Mild deviations from normal may be the result of laboratory error, and should be verified. If
ionized calcium may be normal and should be measured if clinically indicated.
Hypochloremia with normal serum sodium: Like the low calcium level, the ceviation of
history of vomiting, which could lead to loss of chloride.
Low serum bicarbonate (acidemia) with increased anion gap: This combination of
perfusion cannot be ruled out. Other unmeasured anions may include exogenous
and clinical information, could present with some similar changes on the profile, including
increased anion gap, azotemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia.
Increased ALP and GGT: These enzymes often indicate cholestasis. Liver disease is common
in older cats and cannot be ruled out here, although no hyperbilirubinemia or bilirubinuria is
roidism, also may cause increased serum activities of these enzymes.
Increased ALT and AST: Elevations in these enzymes suggest hepatocellular damage, but
Hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia: Postprandial effects are unlikely in this
serum lipids. In diabetes mellitus, inadequate insulin action reduces lipoprotein lipase activity
in addition to the generalized recruitment of lipids as an energy source during perceived
tissue "starvation."
Case Summary and Outcome
Decker was stabilized in the hospital and sent home, where he continued to do well on a
higher dose of insulin. As discussed in the previous case, some patients with diabetes mellitus
have normal or nearly normal serum electrolyte values, especially if there are no accompanying
gastrointestinal issues and the patient is able to drink water. Decker's hypochloremia was more
likely due to the vomiting than the actual hyperglycemia. Likewise, dehydration secondary to
osmotic diuresis can cause prerenal azotemia in some patients like Decker and Hooligan
(Chapter 3, Case 20), but not others (Jason, Chapter 7, Case 15; Marion and Amaryllis
Chapter 3, Cases 18 and 19). Still others may have low BUN and serum creatinine as a result of
compensated polyuria/polydipsia and/or muscle wasting (Decker and Gerhardt, Chapter 5,
Case 22). Other laboratory abnormalities that can be commonly associated with diabetes

exacerbate or precipitate clinical diabetes.
Increased BUN with low creatinine: Increased BUN with normal or low creatinine may occur
with mild pre-renal or renal decreases in glomerular filtration rate. The increased BUN in this

 osmotic diuresis. Vomiting could further contribute to potassium loss, and insulin therapy
may lead to translocation ot potassium into cells.
Decreased serum bicarbonate (acidemia): The production of organic acids such as ketoacids
is the likely cause of the acidemia. In most cases, this would cause an increased anion gap,
however the accumulation of unmeasured anions is counterbalanced by electrolyte
abnormalities. Large amounts of ketoacids also may be eliminated in the urine, so polyuria

Case Summary and Outcome
Smooch was treated with antibiotics and gastroprotectants along with insulin therapy for her
diabetes. Although becoming regenerative, her anemia worsened and she became hypopro-
teinemic secondary to gastrointestinal hemorrhage. As a result, she required a blood
transfusion. Her pneumonia gradually improved during her hospitalization. In addition, her
ketosis eventually resolved, and she was discharged on insulin with a nasogastric tube for
nutritional support. The dose of corticosteroids was reduced in order to minimize its effects
on the gastrointestinal tract and to improve sensitivity to insulin therapy.

should be monitored carefully when insulin therapy is instituted because insulin will cause
some translocation of serum potassium into cells. Rapid and dangerous fluctuations in
potassium may occur during treatment for diabetes even if the initial serum potassium values
are within reference intervals, so levels should be monitored carefully during initia
stabilization.

decrease with impaired liver function such as glucose, BUN and cholesterol appear to be

be needed to rule out liver dysfunction. Iron deficiency may be a more likely explanation of 
the anemia. Zippy has melena, which is a common cause of iron deficiency in older dogs.

Increased ALP: Diabetes mellitus is one of the endocrinopathies that may be associated with
elevations in some liver enzymes. A concurrent corticosteroid induction cannot be ruled out.
Given the normal bilirubin and ALT, primary liver disease seems less likely at this time.

hepatocellular damage, the ALT usually will also be increased, but is not the case here.

Case Summary and Outcome
Despite therapy, Zippy's clinical condition continued to deteriorate after presentation, and he
became anuric. The marked difficulty breathing suggested the potential for pulmonary
thromboembolism. His melena continued, and he began to vomit large amounts of blood.
The degree of Zippy's hyperglycemia is unusual compared with the other cases of diabetes in
this book (Chapter 3, Cases 18, 19, 20; Chapter 5, Case 22, and the preceeding three cases in
this chapter), and is the most likely to cause significant shift of fluids from the interstitial to the
intravascular space, diluting electrolytes. Refer back to the Case Summary and Outcome for
the previous case (Smooch) for further discussion and comparison of variable electrolyte

"Stowaway" is a 3-year-old female alpaca presenting with a one week history of lateral
recumbency, bruxism, decreased appetite, and dullness. Several months ago, Stowaway gave 
birth to a cria, was down for 2 days, and did not produce milk. At that time, she was
hospitalized for several days, diagnosed with gastrointestinal parasitism and treated. Three
months later she had another episode of recumbency and fecal flotation revealed parasitism.
Stowaway again responded well to treatment and gained weight. At this presention, the
alpaca is depressed and in sternal recumbancy. Stowaway is thin and has bilateral gut sounds

medullary washout could interfere with renal concentrating ability in addition to any
concurrent renal disease.
Hypoproteinemia with hypoalbuminemia: Hypoalbuminemia with normal globulins often
implies either selective glomerular loss of albumin or decreased production of albumin
associated with liver failure or malnutrition. Liver failure cannot be ruled out, but is less likely
with normal serum bilirubin, ALP and GGT. Stowaway is thin, so nutritional factors may
impact protein balance. Proteinuria was not detected on the urinalysis, however with
relatively dilute urine, a urinary protein:creatinine ratio would be a more sensitive test for
glomerular protein loss. The history of parasitism indicates the potential for gastrointestinal
losses of protein, however these are often nonselective losses. In some cases, increased
production of globulin proteins associated with an acute phase reaction or immune
stimulation may be masked by simultaneous nonselective protein loss, resulting in serum
globulin value within the reference interval.

Hypokalemia: Decreased intake is more likely to influence the serum potassium level than
sodium and chloride levels. Potassium losses via the kidney and gut may also contribute to

Increased bicarbonate (alkalosis): Sequestration or loss of acid containing gastrointestinal
secretions due to upper gastrointestinal stasis is the likely cause for this abnormality.

sodium and chloride is prioritized at the expense of hydrogen loss in the urine.
Abdominal fluid: Because of the relatively low cell count consisting of macrophages and high
value typically used for exudate, and repeat sampling may be justified to rule out the
possibility of an early inflammatory reaction.
Case Summary and Outcome
Treatment with intravenous fluids, gastroprotectants, and pain medication resulted in
normalization of the electrolyte and acid/base abnormalities, however Stowaway was persistently
azotemic. Radiographs showed distended and gas filled small intestines with a severely dlilated
intestinal segment in the caudal abdomen. Increased opacity in the second and third gastric
compartments was also noted. The radliologist concluded there was a mechanical or functional
obstruction, which would be compatible with the clinical chemistry data. Because she continued
to be anorexic and recumbent, Stowaway was euthanized. At necropsy, Stowaway had an
annular, sharply demarcated and narrow focus of necrosis in the spiral colon that was compatible
with ischemic necrosis secondary to thrombosis or focal strangulation. The potential for embolic
disease was supported by the presence of multifocal acute thromboemboli in the lungs. Renal

development of thromboembolic disease.
While Stowaway's hyperglycemia and electrolyte abnormalities would be compatible with
diabetes melitus in other species, the degree of hyperglycemia that can be associated with
stress or illness is exaggerated in camelids. The marked degree of hyperg lycemia makes osmotic
and best explains the disproportionate hypochloridemia. Finally, diabetes mellitus is most often
associated with acidosis (Chapter 7, Cases 16, 17, 18), while the metabolic alkalosis present in
this case is more compatible with loss or sequestration of fluid in the upper gastrointestinal tract.

renal, or post-renal causes. Other potential causes of hyperphosphatemia include severe
tissue damage. Small animal patients in renal failure may have high, normal, or low serum
calcium levels, and ionized calcium levels may not correlate with total calcium levels as they
often do in healthy animals. In a small study of cats with urethral obstruction, 75% had low

for these changes is available in Chapter 5, Case 7 (Ringo). The low albumin may make a small
contribution to the decrease in total calcium due to a decrement in protein bound calcium.

proteinuria. Decreased production is unlikely as there is no clear evidence of liver disease, nor is
the cat malnourished.
Hypochloremia and hyponatremia: Given the clinically apparent dehydration, the slight
hyponatremia and hypochloremia are likely due to loss of electrolytes in marginal excess of
water. This may occur with acute renal failure or vomiting. Third space losses such as
uroabdomen can also result in these electrolyte changes and the integrity of the urinary
bladder should be evaluated. The decrease in chloride on Day 1 is slightly greater than the

Hypercholesterolemia: The hypercholesterolemia is mild, however it may be a marker for
various metabolic derangements, endocrinopathies, and hepatic or renal disease (See Chapter
3). Like hyperbilirubinemia, this abnormality appears to be resolving and should be monitored

Hypochloremia: By Day 2, the mild hyponatremia has been corrected, and there is a dispro-

changes in renal tubular flow rates and fluctutations in acid/base status. On Day 2, urine flow
indicate a mixed acid/base disorder. The low anion gap on day 2 probably reflects hypopro-
teinemia, while the markedly increased HCO3 suggests alkalemia. The dramatic change in
acid/base status over one day in this case is due to overzealous administration of sodium
bicarbonate in response to the previous acidemia.
Case Summary
Simba can be compared with Ringo (Chapter 5, Case 7). Both cats had clinical signs compatible
dilute urine. Both cats were hyperkalemic because the urinary obstruction prevented adequate
potassium excretion. Both cats also had low serum chloride, with serum sodium values low or
mear the lower limit of the reference interval. Both cats also had serum bicarbonate levels near
the lower limit of the reference interval initially (possibly uremic acidlosis or lactic acidosis), but
Simba's treatment with bicarbonate induced an iatrogenic alkalosis on Day 2. Another
significant change in Simba's blood work on Day 2 is the rapid drop in serum potassium level
that is associated with relief of the urinary tract obstruction and subsequent diuresis. It is likely

result in a pre-renal component as well.
Hypocalcemia: Gastrointestinal disease, renal disease, and sepsis may be associated with
hypocalcemia in Equidae (Toribio). José has evidence of urinary obstruction. Hypocalcemia is
most typical of acute renal failure and is often accompanied by hyperphosphatemia, which is
not present here. Sepsis is possible given the inflammatory leukogram. Poor gastrointestinal

relatively high concentration of chloride, and this may be an additional route for loss of
electrolytes if Jose has been sweating due to pain. Osmotic draw of additional fluid from

association with metabolic alkalosis, which is present in this case. Digestive disturbances
resulting in loss or sequestration of chloride containing fluid can lower serum chloride, and
this may be possible considering the decreased gut sounds and failure to pass manure.
Hyperkalemia: Accumulation of potassium in the serum can occur when glomerular filtration

permeable serosal lining.
Increased bicarbonate (alkalemia): Sequestration or loss of acid or chloride containing fluids
will precipitate alkalosis. Alkalosis also may be perpetuated by the need to conserve sodium
and the relative deficit of chloride. When sodium is resorbed in the proximal tubule, an anion
must follow to maintain electrical neutrality. When chloride is not available in adequate
quantities, increased amounts of sodium are present in the distal tubule. Sodium resorption
will be coupled with hydrogen loss and generation of bicarbonate, maintaining the alkalosis.
Increased ALP and GGT: The combination of elevations in ALP and GGT suggest
hepatobiliary disease. Severe cholestasis seems unlikely because the serum bilirubin is within
reference intervals. In large animal species, the GGT is considered a more reliable indicator of
liver disease, and it is compatible with liver damage associated with hyperlipidemia. The GGT
value should be interpreted with caution, however, because the upper limit of the GGT
reference interval for donkeys and burros may be two to three times greater than that of
potentially leading to errors of interpretation.
Increased AST: This enzyme is a nonspecific indicator of tissue damage, possibly liver in this

the increase in AST is more likely to be associated with liver damage than muscle injury.
Hypertriglyceridemia: Increased serum triglycerides can be associated with metabolic
disorders, particularly hyperlipemia in horses, ponies, and donkeys. Note that serum
triglyceride values may be slightly higher in healthy donkeys compared to horses. Fasting

triglyceride synthesis and fatty infiltration of organs, including the liver. In this case, the
Case Summary and Outcome
Jose was taken to surgery for correction of his uroabdomen. Nutritional support was instituted
and he recovered from his hyperlipidemia. Like Simba, the obstructed cat (Chapter 7, Case
20), the inability to excrete urine from the body leads to excess potassium accumulation and
azotemia. In Jose's case, the cause of the hyponatremia and hypochloremia is somewhat
clearer than for Simba. In addition to loss of electrolytes into the effusion, the same osmotic
effects that cause intravascular fluid shifts that diluted sodium and chloride in the
hyperglycemic alpaca (Chapter 7, Case 19) and cases of diabetes occur here as well. Sweating
is also a route for electrolyte loss in Equidae. The secondary hyperlipidemia could cause
artifactually low values for electrolytes if indirect potentiometry or flame photometry
methodology were used. Secondary metabolic disease may develop in anorexic horses,

the numbers of band neutrophils remain within the reference interval. Small numbers of
result of endothelial injury or lesions in hematopoietic tissues. In this case, hypoxemia
associated with diminished cardiac function or sepsis may cause endothelial damage and
release of erythroid precursors.
Serum Biochemical Profile
Hypoglycemia: Because of the inflammatory leukogram and the cytologic appearance of the
pericardial fluid, sepsis is an important differential diagnosis for the hypoglycemia, assuming
that no processing errors occurred. The hypoglycemia is mild and may not be associated with
clinical effects.

Manual of Veterinary Clinical Chemisty: A Case Study Approach
Increased BUN with normal creatinine: Because a urine specific gravity is not available for
this patient, renal function is dlifficult to evaluate. BUN may increase prior to creatinine early
in renal compromise or with decreased tubular flow rates associated with dehydration or
other causes of pre-renal azotemia such as decreased cardiac output. Sepsis may also cause
an increase in BUN but no change in creatinine. Consumption of a high protein diet can
elevateBUN.
Hyperphosphatemia: Decreased glomerular filtration rate is a common cause of hyperphos-
phatemia and is consistent with pre-renal azotemia in a patient that is dehydrated or has
impaired cardiac function. Tissue necrosis may increase serum phosphorus. However, there is
little evidence to support this mechanism without a CK, only a mildly increased AST, and the
potassium within reference intervals. Because the calcium is also low, hypoparathyroidism
also may be considered. The most likely cause of the hypocalcemia is decreased protein
bound calcium secondary to the hypoalbuminemia.
Hypoalbuminemia and normal globulin: Isolated hypoalbuminemia may be attributable to
coagulation times. However, other substances produced by the liver such as urea and
cholesterol are not decreased. Specific tests of liver function such as serum bile acids or
blood ammonia could be performed as more sensitive and specific indicators of liver
function. Alternatively, the liver may decrease production of albumin in response to
context of the neutrophilia and septic pericardial effusion. Decreased production due to
starvation is unlikely in a patient with adequate body condition. Albumin also may be
selectively lost via the glomerulus, and could be evaluated by urinalysis. Nonspecific protein
losses into third space including the pericardial sac usually result in decreases in both albumin
and globulins. Repeated drainage of the pericardial effusion can contribute to the hypoalbu-
minemia. Loss of globulins by this route may be countered by increased production with
inflammation, resulting in globulin values that fall within the reference interval. Lastly, dilution
of albumin may occur in fluid loading states such as congestive heart failure, which could be
an issue here because of the pericardial effusion.
Hyponatremia and hypochloremia: Similar to protein, serum levels of sodium and chloride
reflect the balance of intake, losses, and dilution. Routes of electrolyte losses are similar to
protein and include the kidney, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and third space. In Pat's case, third 
space loss into the pericardial cavity, especially with repeated drainage, could deplete
electrolytes. Electrolyte loss via the kidneys may be evaluated by measuring urinary fractional
excretions, however these are rarely performed in routine practice. The absence of significant
signs of gastrointestinal disease makes this route unlikely. Hemodilution or hemoconcen-
tration also may alter serum electrolyte concentrations if free water changes are dispropor-
tionate to gains or losses of electrolytes. In the case of congestive heart failure, poor
water intake and free water retention, effectively diluting sodium and chloride. Most
domestic animals on commercial diets will not have dietary deficiency or excess of sodium
andchloride.
Hyperbilirubinemia: The septic process described above may be interfering with
hepatocellular uptake of bile, resulting in a mild hyperbilirubinemia. Increases in ALP, ALT,
increased bilirubin, although the cholestatic enzyme GGT is not elevated. Hemolysis as a
cause of the mild increase in serum bilirubin is unlikely give the normal PCV. If the hyper-
bilirubinemia persists after successful treatment of the infectious process, further
Electrolyte and Acid/Base Evaluaion 393
investigation of the potential for liver disease should be considered.
Increased ALP with normal GGT: Extrahepatic causes of liver enzyme elevations should
always be considered in addition to the potential for hepatobiliary disease. Both sepsis and
cardiovascular disease have the potential to elevate serum liver enzyme activities in the
absence of primary liver pathology. A thorough drug history should be taken to rule out
effects of medications, and concurrent endocrinopathies need to be considered for their
potential to impact liver enzymes.
Increased ALT and AST: ALT is relatively liver specific in small animal species and generally
reflects hepatocellular damage. AST is present in the liver, but is less specific and will
expected to cause hepatocellular damage, but may injure other tissues as well.
Coagulation profile: Both the PT and APTT are prolonged, indicating a defect of secondary
hemostasis. Both liver disease and sepsis may impair hemostasis. Disseminated intravascular
coagulation is not yet occurring based on the normal platelet numbers and fibrin
degradation products.
Case Summary and Outcome
Based on the initial data, Pat was treated with fluids and antibiotics. Echocardiography
and a small left ventricle with moderate function. Because of the persistent pericardial
effusion, a multi-hole catheter was placed for continuous drainage. Later, Pat had surgery to
remove a section of the pericardium. Histology revealed severe fibrinopurulent bacterial

material. Over the five days following surgery, Pat became progressively more bright and
alert. Drainage collected from the chest tubes showed diminishing inflammation, and tubes
were removed. Pat was discharged on long-term combination antibiotic therapy.
Like Snow (Case 7) and Isis (Case 11) in this chapter, poor perfusion due to cardiovascular
compromise could lead to free water retention and dilution of Pat's serum electrolytes. In
Pat's case, loss of electrolytes into the pericardial effusion would also potentiate
associated with the use of diuretics for her heart disease. Isis experienced cutaneous loss of
electrolytes through her degloving wound. Pat's serum potassium levels are currently within
the reference interval. However, serum potassium levels do not accurately reflect total body
potassium stores, which may be low due to the efusion, anorexia or vomiting. Poor renal
perfusion associated with septic shock may promote higher serum potassium. Serum
potassium values may fluctuate rapidly in response to therapy or changes in Pat's medical
condition. Unlike Snow, Isis and Pat may have experienced nonselective protein losses as
well. Isis was able to maintain serum protein levels while Pat developed hypoproteinemia.
Serum protein levels may also be affected by water retention and dilution.

Interpretation
CBC: There is a marked mature neutrophilic leukocytosis with toxic change compatible with
inflammation, the source of which is the thoracic cavity. Diamond also has a normocytic,
normochromic anemia that is interpreted to be non-regenerative. A reticulocyte count is
needed to confirm this conclusion. Anemia of chronic disease is a likely contributor, however
given the relatively low protein, acute hemorrhage should also be considered. Infectious
also suggests that a bone marrow disorder should be considered, however decreased
platelets may be associated with increased consumption secondary to hemorrhage or
inflammatory disease rather than failure of production. Patients with a septic focus may
develop disseminated intravascular coagulation, which can cause moderate thrombocy
topenia due to increased consumption.

Diamondwouldbenefitfromsupplementation.
Hypoproteinemia with hypoalbuminemia and borderline-low globulins: Dilution, decreased
production, and increased losses are the basic mechanisms tor low serum protein values. No
specific evaluation of hydration status was mentioned in the clinical history, however with the
history of lethargy and anorexia, Diamond is more likely to be dehydrated than overhydrated
associated with malnutrition, however the decrease in protein associated with poor intake is
usually milder than the seen here. Because there is evidence of inflammation, albumin
production may be low because it is an acute phase reactant. Poor liver function also may
result in low albumin production, however this seems less likely in the context of the clinica
history. Increased losses into the septic effusion in the thorax is a major contributor to the

Decreased intake is also not likely to be important. Loss into the effusion is the most likely
cause for the abnormality, although other sources of increased loss cannot be ruled out. The
additional decrease in chloride that cannot be accounted for by the change in sodium is
attributed to the alkalemia.
decreased intake may also be a factor for this electrolyte. Acid/base abnormalities are often
cited as a cause for cellular translocation of potassium
Alkalemia (increased HcO3): The alkalemia may be due to metabolic alkalosis or a

Case Summary and Outcome
 Pleural effusion was documented radiographically, and Diamond experienced respiratory
arrest during bilateral chest tube placement. She was successfully resuscitated and placed on
a ventilator overnight. She responded to antibiotic treatment for the septic process in her
thoracic cavity and was eventually weaned from the ventilator.
 Diamond's data may be compared with June (Chapter 4, Case 11), who also had pyothorax.
Both cats had hyponatremia and hypochloridemia, but June was able to maintain her serum
potassium level while Diamond was hypokalemic. Both experienced significant protein losses
along with electrolyte depletion associated with the effusions. Both cats also had mild hyper-

hypoglycemia may be considered. The inflammatory leukogram and poor clinical condition at
presentation are compatible with sepsis. Impaired liver function associated with a congenital
portovascular anomaly is possible and supported by other laboratory indicators indicative of
poor hepatic function, including low BUN, hypoalbuminemia, hyperbilirubinemia, decreased
serum cholesterol and prolonged coagulation times. Evaluation of liver function by
measurement of serum bile acids or blood ammonia is strongly recommended. The young
age of the patient makes paraneoplastic hypoglycemia unlikely. Although Caviar clearly has
poor body condition and nutritional deficits, this is rarely a cause of hypoglycemia by itself
(See Belinda, Chapter 4, Case 1; Marsali, Chapter 5, Case 3; Diva, Chapter 6, Case 16).
Decreased BUN and creatinine: Decreased BUN may be related to potentially compromised
liver function. Low creatinine is attributed to poor body condition and low muscle mass

with the history of chronic diarrhea as well as gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Hemorrhage may
be secondary to defects in hemostasis as indicated by the prolonged coagulation times.
Given the chronicity of the problem, other causes of diarrhea and protein losing enteropathy
need to be evaluated in this patient. Nutritional factors may further compromise Caviar's
ability to compensate for ongoing losses and to maintain serum protein levels. Compounding

Globulin levels in young animals may be slightly lower than aged animals because they have
been exposed to fewer antigens.
Hyponatremia with low normal chloride: Gastrointestinal losses of electrolytes are
resulting in retention of free water by the kidney in response to hypovolemia and dilutional
effects. The chloride is relatively high compared with sodium, however the serum
bicarbonate remains within the reference interval. This is compatible with a mixed acid/base
disorder, and blood gas analysis should be considered.
Hyperkalemia: Assuming that significant hemolysis or release from damaged tissues is ruled
out, decreased urinary excretion of potassium should be evaluated. This commonly occurs if
urine cannot be eliminated from the body such as with oliguric/anuric renal failure, urinary
tract obstruction, or ruptured urinary bladder. Although a urinalysis is not currently available,
consistent with hypoadrenocorticism, however Caviar would be a very young dog to present
with this condition. Alternatively, some dogs with primary gastrointeintal disorders may
develop these electrolyte abnormalities, resembling hypoadrenocorticism. This occurs
because of diarrhea-induced losses of water, sodium and chloride result in volume
contraction and subsequent low renal tubular flow rate and potassium retension. Because
whipworm infection has been documented in dogs with this pseudohypoadrenocorticism
syndrome, a fecal floatation is warranted.

hyperbilirubinemia. The slight elevation in ALP and normal GGT make significant cholestasis less
likely. Because Caviar is anemic, the blood film should be evaluated for evidence of hemolysis.
Increased ALP: The cause of this mild abnormality may be difficult to determine in a dog
with a complex clinical presentation. Extra-hepatic causes of increased ALP include bone
growth in young dogs and the effects of medications and hormones. Mild cholestasis could

Intestinal loss secondary to protein losing enteropathy
Coagulation profile: Prolongation of coagulation times may occur with decreased liver
function due to failure to produce coagulation factors. This may be compounded by impaired
gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin K, resulting in vitamin K deficiency and production of
inactive coagulation factors.

Case Summary and Outcome
Caviar was treated with antibiotics, intravenous fluids, plasma, and dextrose. Her condition
floatation. Postprandial serum bile acids were 221 μmol/L (reference interval = 0-25),
confirming poor liver function. A large extrahepatic vascular shunt was demonstrated by
abdominal ultrasound, however there was concern about the possibility of concurrent
intestinal disease, including lymphangiectasia or infectious enteritis. Caviar stabilized with
medical therapy and underwent surgical correction of the shunt. She began to eat and
developed ascites. Another surgery was performed to attempt to reduce the constriction of
the shunt, but it was not possible to remove or enlarge the constrictor. She responded to
symptomatic therapy and was discharged to the care of the referring veterinarian.
In Caviar's case, the combination of increased gastrointestinal losses of electrolytes with poor
perfusion and inadequate renal excretion of potassium produced electrolyte abnormalities that
could be associated with hypoadrenocorticism (Case 13), uroabdomen (Case 21), and other
causes of third space losses such as effusion (Case 1). In previous cases of electrolyte
depletion associated with hypoglycemia, the decreased blood glucose has been due to sepsis
(Pat, Chapter 7, Case 22), but Caviar's hypoglycemia is due to inadequate liver function.

Interpretation
CBC: Albus has leucopenia characterized by marked neutropenia and mild toxic change
suggestive for acute inflammation or endotoxemia, likely related to intestinal disease.
Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: Diabetes mellitus is rare in horses, and the hyperglycemia in this case is
related to stress or excitement.

disease (see Faith, Chapter 5, Case 19).
Hypoproteinemia with hypoglobulinemia: Hypoglobulinemia is most often associated with
concurrent hypoalbuminemia and reflects non-selective protein losses into the gut, third
reference intervals. Isolated hypoglobulinemia can reflect failure of passive transfer in
neonatal animals, but globulins remain somewhat low until antigenic exposure of initially
naive animals increases immunoglobulin production over time. Albus is likely to have had
serum globulin levels at the lower end of the reference interval prior to his illness as an age-
immunodeficiency syndrome of Arabian foals can result in failure of globulin production.
Mild hyponatremia with disproportionately greater hypochloridemia: Gastrointestinal
losses of sodium and chloride are contributing to these abnormalities. Decreases in chloride
that are disproportionate to changes in sodium are often associated with alkalemia. When a
mixed acid/base disorder is suspected. In Albus, poor perfusion and lactic acidosis may lead
to increased amounts of lactate in the urine. Because lactate cannot be resorbed by the renal
tubules, sodium excretion in the urine is increased to maintain electrical neutrality
Consequently, chloride resorption in the proximal and collecting tubules does not occur
sodlium, which is failing to occur.
Hyperkalemia: Accumulation of potassium in the serum can occur when glomerular filtration
rate drops sufficiently to prevent elimination of potassium in the urine. Additionally, inorganic
acidosis can cause a transcellular shift of potassium outside of cells. Other potential causes
402 Mamual of Vveterinary Clinical Chemisty: A Case Sudy Approach
for hyperkalemia that are unlikely in this particular patient based on the clinical history and
laboratory work would include massive tissue necrosis or rhabdomyolysis, hypoaldosteronism,
and effects of drugs such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or trimethoprim-sulfa
antibiotics. Rhabdomyolysis and tissue necrosis are unlikely given the very mild increases in
enzymes such as CK.
High anion gap acidosis: The high anion gap is the result of accumulation of unmeasured
anions. Possibilties for Albus include uremic acids, and lactic acidosis secondary to
dehydration and poor perfusion.
Increased ALP and LDH: Liver enzymes may increase secondary to intestinal disease due to
bacteria, endotoxin, or inflammatory mediators. Hepatocellular hypoxia may result from
systemic inflammation and circulatory imbalances. Ascending biliary infection or regurgitation
of intestinal contents into the common bile cuct associated with increased luminal pressure
with proximal enteritis all had liver esions that were attributed to the intestinal disease,
supporting the interpretation that liver enzyme elevations can occur secondary to enteritis
(Davis). While hepatocellular injury is the most likely cause for the increased serum LDH, this
enzyme is not liver specific and may also originate from muscle tissue. ALP may also be high
in young animals due to bone growth.
Increased CK: This enzyme indicates muscle damage. Muscle damage may occur as a result of
transport or medical procedures such as intramuscular injections. If Albus is painful, he may
self-traumatize and cause muscle damage. Although connective tissue in general is resistant to
the effects of hypoxia, poor perfusion could contribute to muscle damage in some cases.
Case Summary and Outcome
compared with Delaney (Chapter 7, Case 8), who had much less complicated laboratory data.
Delaney illustrates gastrointestinal disease in which electrolyte losses are minimal, while free
water retention or increased intake to compensate for ongoing fluid losses, resulting in
hyponatremia and hypochloremia. Note the low sodium and chloride with high potassium, a
has no apparent acid/base abnormalities, enteritis and fluid imbalances contribute to the
development of a high anion gap metabolic acidosis in Albus.

Overview
Step 1: If electrolyte levels are high, consider
Increased input through diet or therapeutic interventions (Case 1, and 14)
 Decreased elimination, particularly through the kidney (Case 9, 13, 20, and 21)
Concentration of electrolytes in a smaller volume of fluid (Case 8, and 15)
Electrochemical compensation for acid/base abnormalities
Step 2: If electrolyte levels are low, consider
Decreased input via diet, mostly for potassium (Case 4, and 11)
Electrolyte loss:
Gastrointestinal tract (Case 4, 5, 6, 7, 18, 19, 24, and 25)
Kidneys (Case 9, 13, 18, and 19)
Third space (body cavities, interstitium) (Case 3, 20, 21, and 23)
Cutaneous osses (Case 11, and 21)
Hemorrhage (Case 10, and 24)
Dilution (Case 9, 10, 12, 17, 18, 21, and 22)
Electrochemical compensation for acid/base abnormalities
Step 3: If electrolyte values are normal, but the patient has potential sources of retention or
Step 4: If the patient is alkalotic (high bicarbonate), consider bicarbonate retention, acid
sequestration or depletion (Case 5, 6, 10, 11, 19, and 21)
Step 5: If the patient is acidemic (low bicarbonate), consider loss of bicarbonate or acid
retention (Case 12, 18 and 25)
Step 6: If the patient has an increased anion gap, consider hyperalbuminemia with
dehydration or accumulation of endogenous or exogenous organic acids (Case 6, 12, 17, 18,
20, and 21)
