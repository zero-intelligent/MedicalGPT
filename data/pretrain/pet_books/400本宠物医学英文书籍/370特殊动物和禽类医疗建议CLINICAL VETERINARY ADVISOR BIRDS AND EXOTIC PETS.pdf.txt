 prognosis, especially for hepatic coccid-

better prognosis. Subclinical infections

the patient has a good to excellent
 prognosis for full recovery with sup-
 portive care in 2 to 4 days. However,
the dramatic appearance of FRS, its
 similarity to spinal trauma, and lack of
rapid recovery can lead owners to
elect euthanasia if they are not coun-
 seled about the prognosis.
PREVENTION
● In most cases, no apparent precursors
to FRS are noted. However, hypokale-
 mia may contribute to development of
the disease.
● Warn clients to avoid the following:

1.
Adhere strictly to the protocol and make a note of any side effects which are observed during the treatment.
2. The myelosuppression is the most important factor in monitoring. Other side effects might include vomiting, diarrhea, or nausea.
Systemic antibiotic therapy might be indicated very early in the protocol. L-AsP has the potential to cause anaphylaxis (I have
not seen it, yet). In case any reaction is noticed after the first dose, premedicate with dexamethasone (1 mg/kg SC) 10 min
before the subsequent treatments.
 3. As indicated in the protocol, a 25% reduction of the myelosuppressive drugs should be initiated if the CBC shows a severe drop
(segmented neutrophil count < 1000/μL). The myelosuppressive drugs are CTX, CYTOSAR, MTX, LEUK, and PCB. Start antibiotic
therapy to prevent secondary infection.
4. When toxic side effects occur use the scale below in order to grade the toxicity.
5. The Cytoxan elixir (injectable drug prepared as oral medication) is usually prepared by a compounding pharmacy. Lactated
Ringer's solution is given to avoid sterile cystitis.
6. Eventually we want to publish results and kindly ask you to share your findings (toxicity, blood work results, and outcome)
with us.
7. If an animal should die during the therapy, try to get a necropsy, as any information available is vital.

Convulsive syncope (anoxic) and aroxic-epileptic seizures are syncopal events generally caused by cardiac arhythmias that produce profound syncope, temporary
