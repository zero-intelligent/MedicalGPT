pleasuretowritetheForewordforthenewManualofAnaesthesiaand

subject of analgesia is covered in depth,and in response to changing
trendsinpet ownership thereis a much expanded section on anaesthesia
ofexotic species.Recentinnovationsinboth thepharmacologyof new
drugs and the introduction of new equipment arefully discussed.
I am sure that practitionerswill give a bigwelcome to the section on
anaesthesia in the clinical setting, in which the regimens appropriate for
different types of surgery are discussed. In addition, the chapter dealing

Preface
A sound understandingofgeneralanaesthesiaisvitalforallpractitioners,
whatever their primary area of expertise.In addition,adequate pain
controlafter injury,either traumatic or surgical,is one of the most
important responsibilities of all veterinary surgeons.
Thismanual,withcontributionsfromadistinguishedpanel ofinter-
national experts,offers the clinician a practicaland easily accessible
guide to anacsthesia and analgesiain small animals.Basicprinciples and
pharmacology are clearly explained,followed by anaestheticmanage-
mentinthe clinical setting.Withincreasingspecialization in practice and
increased clientexpectations,thecomplexityofsurgicaltechniques and
the types of patient they are performed upon have grown apace.One aim
of thismanual,therefore,hasbeentodescribe theperioperativemanage-
ment of patients with pre-existing pathology and itsinfluence on the
course of anaesthesia.Anunderstanding of these spccial requirements is
essentialfor asuccessfuloutcome
Uniquely,the manual includes information on differences between
UK and North American practice.Although the tcxl retains British
Pharmacopoeia names for drugs,where these are differentfrom their
North American counterparts theUS Pharmacopoeia nameis given at
first use in each chapter.

CIRCULATION
Management andmonitoring of the circulation during
thepostoperativeperiodis important to ensure a rapid
smoothrestoration of physiologicallynormalcardio-
vascular variables.Heart rate and rhythm,pulse rate
and quality,mucous membrane colour and capillary
refill time should all bc rcgularly and frequently as-
sessed to identify promptly any adverse trends in the
patient'scondition.Monitoringof central venous pres-
sure and mean arterial pressure can be expensive but
provides accurate and often invaluable information.

Factors affecting MAC
Circadian rhythms
Metabolic acidosis - causes a slight decrease in MAC (methodology affects the results)
Hypoxia - MAC is decreased when PaO, is below 38 mmHg
Anaemia - when oxygen (O,) content is <4.3 ml O/100 ml blood (haematocrit = 13%), MAC is decreased
Hypotension - dccrcasesMAC
Neurotransmitter release -increases MAC
Age-older animals require less anaesthetic
Temperature - inereasing temperature inereascs the cercbral mctabolie rate of the brain and increases MAC
Thyroid function - whole body O, consumption minimally affects MAC; in dogs, changing from gross
hypothyroidism togrosshyperthyroidismincreasesMAC by only20%
requirement when they are accompanied by changes in brain sodium concentrations
Lithium - decreases MAC
Calcium - very high cercbrospinal fluid (CSF) calcium ion concentrations produce a state
resembling general anaesthesia
Bromine-decreases MAC
Sodium
Hypernatraemia - increases MAC
Serum and CSF hypo-osmolality dilute CSF sodium and decrcasc MAC
Narcotics -decrcase MAC
Sedatives and tranquillizers - decrease MAC
Local anaesthetics - decrease MAC
Pregnancy - decreases MAC
Other inhalant anaesthetics(nitrous oxide)-decrease MAC
FactorsNOT affectingMAC
Type of stimulation
Duration of anaesthesia
Species - from species to species MAC varies by 10-20%. Interspecies variation may be explained by
variations in techniques
Sex
Hypocarbia and hypercarbia within the range of 14-95 mmHg
Metabolic alkalosis
Hypoxia and hyperoxia - within the range of 38-500 mmHg, oxygen does not affect MAC. Below 38
mmHg, hypoxia induces progressive narcosis and reduces MAC
Hypertension
Elcctrolytes and osmolality
Potassium - no effect
Hyperosmolality -no consistentchange inMAC

drugs such as butorphanol aremore likely tobe use-
ful in birds than conventional u-agonists,such as
morphine.
Steroids
Birds are very susceptible to the deleterious side
effectsofglucocorticoids,anddosesshouldbekeptto
a minimum.Theuseofultra-short-actingsteroidssuch
as hydrocortisone sodium succinate (10mg/kg i.v.) or
prednisolone sodium succinate (11-25mg/kg i.v.)

PRE-ANAESTHETICPREPARATIONS
Given the problems discussed above,a thorough
clinical examination is essential.If the animal is
likely tobedehydrated,anaesthesia shouldbepost-
poned if this is practicable and fluid therapy given.In
small mammals this is easily achieved by intraperito-
neal or subcutaneous injection of an appropriate fluid

Although this prevents struggling,breath holding may

removed. Administration of oxygen is not associated
withbreath holding,and it is advisable to allow the
animal to breath 100% oxygen for 1-2 minutes before

Techniques for supporting the circulation or treat-

animals (see Chapter 24). One practical problem is the
difficulty ofvcnous access and the small quantities of

Manual of Small Animal
Anaesthesia and Analgesia
British
Small Animal
A sound understanding of general anaesthesia is
Veterinary
vital for all practitioncrs, whatever their primary
Association
area of expertise. In addition, adequate pain
control after injury, either traumatic or surgical,
is one of the most important responsibilities of
all veterinary surgeons.
This manual, with contributions from a
distinguished panel of international authors,
offers the clinician a practical and easily
accessible guide to anaesthesia and analgesia in
small animals.Basic principles and
pharmacology are clearly explained, followed by
 anacsthctic management in the clinical setting.
Theperi-operativemanagement ofpatientswith
pre-existing pathology, and its influence on the
course of anesthesia is given prominence within the book and,uniquely,
information on differences between UK and North America practice is included.
The significant developments in the fields of anaesthesia and monitoring sincc
the first edition was published in 1989 are included, and there is a substantially
expanded section on exotic species.
Whilst it is primarily aimed at
veterinary practitioners and students,
veterinary nurses, particularly those
studyingfor theDiploma in Advanced
Veterinary Nursing, will find much of
relevance in this completely rewritten
successor to the Manual of
AnaesthesiaforSmallAnimal
Practice.
