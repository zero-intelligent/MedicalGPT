PREFACE
Diet is an important consideration in the care of a pet and is a major
factor in health and life expectancy. Home-Prepared Dog and Cat Diets
is a urique handbook in that it provides an introduction to nutrition
of the healthy dog and cat as well as anl extensive discussiont of medical
disorders that can be treated in part by dietary management. Recipes
are provided for making home-prepared diets for both healthy pets
and pets with special conditions. These diets have been formulated
with a sophisticated computer program to ensure that they are bal-
anced and complete, according to the Association of American Feed
Control Officials (AAFCO) guidelines. Many diets have been carefully
formulated for specific health problems according to current veteri
nary recommendations. Diets that have been designed for some special
conditions may not be complete and balanced because of necessary
diet restrictions. This is noted in the recipe, and these diets should be
fed under the direct supervision of your veterinarian.
This edition of Home-Prepared Dog and Cat Diets has been thoroughly
     r r 
to reflect nutritional recommendations based on current research.
New chapters have been added on feeding the puppy and kitten,
feeding the pregnant or lactating dog or cat, feeding the serior pet,
feeding the performance dog. and the role of diet in pets with cancer.
For ease of use, diets have been removed from individual chapters anc
are now found in Section ll of the book. Nutrient content for protein,
fat, carbohydrate, and fiber have been provided for every diet, along
with the rutrient density. Diets can easily be adjusted for any size dog
or cat, and exact ingested nutrient amounts can be calculated. Diets

proper preparation of diets.
With the information presented in this book, pet owners will have
an excellent background in nutrition of the dog and cat. If the diet
directions are carefully followed, owners can safely prepare balanced
diets for their healthy pets. Diets for pets with special conditions
should be thoroughly discussed with the pet's veterinarian to ensure
the proper management of the pet with special needs.

SECTIONI
Nutrition and Dietary
Management
CHAPTER
HomemadeDiets
In the Urited States, there are more than 140 million dogs and cats.
The vast majority of pets receive more than 90% of their calories from
 s s   r    
feeding home-prepared foods to pets for a variety of reasons. In a
recent telephone survey, owners of 635 dogs and 469 cats were ques-
tioned regarding diets fed to their pets. More dogs received noncom-
mercialfoods (table scraps, leftovers, or homemade foods) as compared
to cats. Noncommercial foods were a part of the diet in 31% of dogs
and 13% of cats and comprised at least one-fourth of the diet for 17%
of dogs and 6% of cats. About 3% of pets were exclusively fed home-
made diets, and 7% of dogs received homemade food for at least half
of their diet. Treats of some kind were given daily to 57% of dogs and
26% of cats. Supplements were given to 13% of dogs and 6% of cats
and were reported to include multivitamins, fatty acids, chondropro
tective agents, vitamin C, yeast, taurine, zinc, calcium, and antioxi-
dants, among others.
For humans, food consumption has social and cultural cornota-
tions. With the humarization of pets, owners may associate social and
cultural behaviors with their pets. In the telephone survey, owners
said that cuddling or petting their arimals and talking to the pets were
the most common activities shared with their dogs or cats. Dog owners
were more likely to walk or run with their pets, play with toys together
play fetch, ride in the car together, participate in obedience or agility
training, and go to work together as compared to cat owners. Other
activities that both dog and cat owners shared with their pets included
watching their pets play, grooming their pets, watching television
SECTION 1 NUTRITION AND DIETARY MANAGEMENT
with their pets, and eating with their pets. As pets are treated more as
"humans," many owners may feel that their pets should share the food
customs of humans.
There are many reasons suggested as to why a homemade pet diet
is desired. Some owners wish to feed natural or orgaric foods or vegan
or vegetarian foods. Many wish to cook for their pets and provide a
varied diet. Others may find commercial pet food labels and ingredi-
ents corfusing and want to avoid additives, preservatives, chemicals,
telephone survey, owners feeding noncommercial pet foods had less
trust in their veterinarian to provide sound nutritional advice and felt
   s  n a e  so p s r
Owners feeding noncommercial pet foods were more likely to feel that
processed foods for pets were unhealthy, that cooking destroys rutri-
ents in pet foods, and that orgaric foods were safer and healthier than
other foods. Owners that fed roncommercial food were more likely to
products, that information on pet food labels is misleading, and that
additives in pet foods have unhealthy side effects. They were less
products and less likely to feel that ingredients in commercial pet
foods were wholesome and rutritious. They are less likely to believe
that pets live longer today because of good nutrition from commercial
products, that commercial products contain necessary rutrition, and
         s   
being. Owners feeding noncommercial foods were more likely to
believe that raw bones could be safely fed to pets, that raw meat pro-
vides better rutrition than cooked foods, and that foods sold for
human consumption provide better nutrition than do commercial
pet foods. Owners feeding roncommercial foods also erjoyed prepar-
foods.
Problems Associated with Homemade Diets
Veterinarians are the most commonly cited source for pet nutritional
information; however, about 17% of pet owners cite the Internet as
their primary source for pet nutritional information. Unfortunately,
there is a considerable amount of misirformation present on the
Internet, and it can be difficult to determine which information is
trustworthy. In the telephone survey discussed previously, less than
CHAPTER 1 HOMEMADE DIETS

one-third of owners used a homemade diet recipe specifically designed
for pets. In another survey, 90% of the homemade elimination diets
used by veterinarians were not balanced and were not rutritionally
 s     s o s
the nutritional adequacy of commercial diets to homemade diets,
calcium, the calcium/phosphorus ratio, and vitamins A and E were
below current recommendations for nutritional adequacy in home
made diets. Potassium, copper, and zinc concentrations were also
inadequate in homemade diets.
Feeding unbalanced homemade diets can lead to complications
including osteodystrophy, osteopenia, nutritional secondary hyper-
phosphorus and low in calcium; if no calcium source is added to the
diet, the calcium concentration is typically inadequate and the calcium/
ism occurs when the parathyroid hormone concentration elevates in
anl attempt to raise the serum calcium concentration, and loss of bone
density results. For further discussion of nutritional secondary hyper
parathyroidism see Chapter 17, Diet and Endocrine Disease. Deficiency
of dietary vitamin D can lead to type I rickets, characterized by osteo-
dystrophy. Deficiencies in calcium and vitamin D are especially prob-
and phosphorus for bone growth. Certain ingredients can be very High
in a particular vitamin and cause problems if not a part of a balanced
diet. Liver is very high in vitamin A, and vitamin A toxicity can result
in pets fed unbalanced diets based on liver. Pansteatitis (yellow fat
disease) has been documented in cats fed diets with a high oily fish
content and inadequate in vitamin E.
Some recipes call for the use of raw ingredients. Raw ingredients
often contain bacteria that would normally be destroyed by cooking
(see Chapter 2, Food Safety). The practice of feeding uncooked diets
should be discouraged.
Formulating a Homemade Diet
Formulating a diet is a difficult task. The first step in doing so is to
determine the nutritional requirements of the animal, and these
requirements are based on species, life-stage, and the arimal's special
needs. The Nutrient Research Council (NRC) publishes a book about
the nutritional requirements for various species, and these require-
ments serve as guidelines. The Association of American Feed Control
8
Officials (AAFCO) provides suggested nutrient profiles for dog and
cat foods (see Chapter 3, Nutrients). Once the desired levels of nutri-
ents are decided, then ingredients must be chosen that, in combina-
tion, will provide proper amounts of protein, fat, vitamins, and
minerals. Nutrient databases must be maintained to provide the accu-
rate nutritional analysis of each ingredient. Sophisticated computer
programs contairing human food ingredients are available (The Food
Processor SQL, ESHA Research, Salem, Oregon), but these programs
provide only a nutritional analysis of the combination of ingredients;
they do not formulate a diet. The analysis of the combined ingredients
ciencies or excesses, alterations to ingredients must be made and nutri-
tional adequacy reevaluated. This can be a long and tedious process.
Some veterinary rutritiorists offer a food formulation service or are
available on the telephone for dietary consultations. Some of the vet-
erinary nutritiorists providing this service are listed in Table 1.1.
Assessing a Homemade Diet Recipe
When assessing a homemade diet recipe, there are some guidelines
that can be quickly assessed. First, the five food groups (protein, car-
bohydrate, fat, vitamins, minerals) should appear in the recipe. Second
the carbohydrate source should be present in a higher or equal quan-
ity to that of the protein source. Carbohydrate sources include rice,
barley, lentils, potato, pasta, couscous, or quinoa. In cat foods, the
S    '   a s o o
the ratio should be 2:1 to 3:1. Third, the protein source should be
identified. Fourth, a fat source should be identified. Fat could take the
form of an added vegetable oil or could be included in the meat source
(chicken skin, fat in undrained ground beef, etc.). Fifth, a calcium or
calcium/phosphorus supplement should be present. Calcium carbon-
ate (baking soda) or bone meal (source of calcium and phosphorus)
should also be present. Lastly, a source of vitamins and minerals
should be present, typically in the form of a multivitamin tablet. For
cat diets, a source of taurine should be present.
Choosing a Homemade Diet
There are many homemade recipe diets presented in the second section
of this book. The first step in choosing a diet is to pick a species.

appropriate diet for the life stage of the dog or cat (adult, growth,
senior, reproduction, performance). Dog diets should not be fed to
cats, as these diets will not contain the specific and unique nutrients
that cats need. Cat diets should not be fed to dogs because these diets
will usually provide some nutrients in excess for dogs. The second
step is to determine if there are any special needs of the pet (weight
loss, allergy, renal disease, heart disease, etc.). If special needs are
present, then a diet specific for that condition should be chosen. A
variety of diets using different combinations of ingredients are pre-
sented for each life stage and special condition so that substitutions

ingredients over time to ensure a proper mix of nutrients. The majority
of diets in this book have been formulated to be balanced and nutri-
tionally complete. However, some diets, such as those formulated for
renal disease and other conditions are not nutritionally complete
because of the severe dietary restrictions needed in some conditions.
CHAPTER 1 HOMEMADE DIETS
11
If a diet is not nutritionally complete, this is stated in the cdiet recipe.
These diets should only be fed to dogs or cats with that specific special
condition and should not be fed to healthy pets.
Diet Preparation
Diets should be prepared according to the recipe given, with no sub-
stitutions, additions, or omissions. Each ingredient in the diet is impor
tant and provides specific necessary nutrients. Proper preparation of
homemade diets requires time and effort. An accurate kitchen scale
that measures in grams and ounces is required for diet preparation.
Ingredients should be carefully measured to provide the proper com-
bination of nutrients.
Individual ingredients in the diet (such as meat and the carbohy-
drate source) should be cooked separately. Meat should be cooked
for a minimum of 10 minutes at 180F. Chicken and ground beef
in particular, should be well cooked to prevent bacterial contamina-
fion. The use of raw ingredients is not recommended due to the
increased risk for foodborne illness (see Chapter 2, Food Safety).
Carbohydrate sources such as potatoes should be cooked to improve
their digestibility. Vegetables should be washed and then cooked
prior fo use.
Once the food ingredients have been cooked, they should be mea-
sured and combined. Any salt in the recipe can be added at this time,
but other vitamins and mineral supplements should not be added yet.
Once the food ingredients are combined, the ingredients should be
mixed in a blender to ensure their even distribution. This will prevent
the pet from picking out certain dietary ingredients and not consum-
ing others. An unbalanced diet will be consumed if ingredients are
separate and the pet does not eat the entire mixture. Vitamin and
 mineral supplements should be crushed to a powder form and added
after the food sources have been cooked and combined.
Homemade diets do not contain preservatives and are high in mois-
ture, thus they are highly susceptible to bacterial and fungal contami-
nation if left at room temperature for more than a few hours. The
recipes in this book have been designed to be prepared in small batches
to mirimize the amount of food prepared but not required for feeding.
Any prepared diet that is not being consumed immediately should be
stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for no more than a
few days. If preparation of a larger batch of food is desired, then the
recipe should be prepared up to the point of vitamin and mineral
12  SECTION 1 NUTRITION AND DIETARY MANAGEMENT
supplement addition and stored frozen. When ready to feed, the
portion of diet can be thawed, weighed, and the appropriate amount
of vitamins and minerals can be added prior to feeding. Before feeding
any food that has been stored in the refrigerator or freezer, the color
odor, and consistency should be checked. If there are changes, or there
is visible mold growth, the food should be discarded.
Vitamin and mineral supplements are present in small quantities
but they are a very important part of the diet. Supplements should
be included as stated in each recipe and not substituted or omitted.
For example, many diets include both iodized salt and a salt substi-
tute (potassium chloride). Iodized salt is important as a source of
iodine and sodium, and salt substitute is included as a source of
meal is included in diets because it is an excellent source of calcium
and phosphorus, and calcium carbonate (baking soda) is included as
a calcium source. Some recipes call for one-half of a vitamin or
mineral tablet. In general, these are human products that are not
meant to be cut in half, so each half may not be exactly half of the
vitamins called for in the recipe. However, over the course of several
days, the proper amounts of vitamins and minerals will be fed
overall.
Prior to feeding. the diet should be warmed to just below body
temperature (about 100°F). Especially if food is being warmed in the
microwave, the food should be checked for hot spots, as the food may
heat uneverly. A small amount of water can be added at this time, if
necessary. When feeding, the food should not sit out at room tempera-
ture for more than a few hours. Any food not consumed should be
removed and discarded. Bowls used for serving should be washed
thoroughly after each use.
Monitoring
When feeding a homemade diet, monitoring is important, and the pet
should be examined by a veterinarian at least twice yearly. Body
weight, body condition score, and activity level should routinely be
moritored so that adjustments to the amount of diet fed can be made.
Hair and skin should be monitored, as these are good indicators of
nutritional status. In addition, stool quality should be assessed. The
prepared diets can also be evaluated by a laboratory for nutritional
adequacy. Some laboratories providing this service are listed in
Table 1.2.

CHAPTER 2
FoodSafety
Foodborne illness affects more than 24 million people in the Urited
States every year, and pets can also become ill from contaminated
food. There are two different types of foodborne illness: food infec-
ftions and food toxicosis. Food infection occurs when bacterial cells are
ingested and then invade tissues. These cells then replicate, and after
an incubation period, clirical disease results. The incubation period
is typically 12 hours to 10 days, and examples include infection
with Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Neorickettsia, Vibrio, Yersinia, and
Campylobacter. Food intoxication or "food poisoring" results from the
ingestion of food containing microbial toxins. Clirical signs usually
appear within 6 hours of ingestion, and examples include infection
with Clostridium botulinum, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, myco-
toxins, metals, and biogeric amines.
Most cases of foodborne illness occur when spoiled foods, improp-
erly cooked foods, or garbage is consumed. Foodborne illness is
common in the racing greyhound industry as most of the diet is com-
prised of raw meat in many cases. Raw meats can contain large
rumbers of bacteria that are ingested, causing illness. Even foods
purchased for human consumption can be contaminated with bacteria.
In one study where 981 raw meat samples were obtained from grocery
stores, Enterococcus was isolated as a bacterial contaminant in 97% of
the pork samples and in 1oo% of the ground beef samples. In a study
of 240 meat samples from grocery stores, Salmonella was found as a
contaminant in 22% of the poultry samples and in 2% of the beef
samples. E. coli was a contaminant in 37% of beef, 41% of chicken, 33%
of pork, 48% of turkey, 3% of fish, and 4% of shellfish samples. Ground

meat products were more likely to be contaminated with bacteria
compared to nonground meats. Fastidious hygiene and preparation
are important in the prevention of foodborne illness.
      s  
chemicals should be reviewed. Dogs are more prone to foodborne
illness because they are more likely to eat garbage or consume dead
arimals. Young dogs may be more at risk because younger dogs tend
  so  so   A   a 
nocompromised dogs are at higher risk for foodborne illness because
their immune systems are less able to fight a bacterial infection. The
risk of foodborne illness is higher during warm weather, hunting
season, and during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. Dogs
allowed to freely roam outdoors have an increased exposure to dead
animal tissues, pesticides, and garbage.
In addition, methods of food preparation and storage should be
carefully reviewed, including types of containers used for storage.
Samples of vomit, feces, and urine should be collected and frozen so
that they may be tested for bacteria, pesticides, metals, and other toxic
substances. The entire quantity of food in the original storage con-
tainer should be retained or the ingredients used in the preparation of
the diet should be stored for analysis.

Mycotoxins are metabolites from mold and can cause a variety of
symptoms. Grains such as corn or wheat are most commorly affected
with mycotoxins, but cheeses, nuts, and fruits may also contain myco
toxins. Mycotoxins are produced while grains are growing or are in
storage, and warm temperatures with high humidity generally favor
andFusarium.
Aflatoxin is a mycotoxin produced by Aspergillus. Corn, peanuts,
and grains are the most common sources, and dogs and cats are very
sensitive to low levels of aflatoxin. Clirical signs of aflatoxicosis
inal effusion, or sudden death. The liver is the primary organ affected,
so an increase in serum liver enzyme activity, a decrease in serum

17
protein, and an increase in serum bilirubin are commorly seen. Once
affected, the survival rate is poor. In a recent outbreak of aflatoxicosis
in dogs, 64% did not survive, even with extersive treatment. Aflatoxins
are very stable and are not destroyed by cooking. Grains used for food
manufacturing are routinely tested for aflatoxins.
Vomitoxin is a mycotoxin produced by Fusarium. The chemical
name for vomitoxin is deoxyrivalerol (DON), and vomitoxin most
commorly affects wheat and barley. Like aflatoxin, vomitoxin is heat
stable and is not destroyed by cooking. Dogs and pigs are the most
sensitive to vomitoxin at very low concentrations. The most common

can detect the odor from vomitoxin in the feed and will refuse to eat
food contaminated with vomitoxin
Bacteria
Salmonella
Salmonella are gram-negative bacteria that affect many species,
including mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. Salmonela infects
humans, and transmission from animals to humans can occur; thus, it
is a zoonotic disease. Salmonella is normally present in the intestinal
tract, and healthy dogs and cats are fairly resistant to infection.
Exposure to Salmonella is most commonly through fecal contamina-
tion of food or water and is indicative of inadequate cooking or poor
hygiene in food preparation. Racing greyhounds are commonly
affected as they are routinely fed raw meats that are often contami
nated with Salmonella. In a recent Canadian study, 166 raw diets for
dogs were evaluated for the presence of Salmonella. Overall, Salmonella
was isolated in 21% of the diets, and 67% of these diets contained
chicken. Some of the Salmonella strains isolated were also resistant to
many antimicrobials, which is of major concerr.
Clirical signs of Salmonella infection include loss of appetite, leth-
argy, diarrhea, gastroenteritis, chroric fever, conjunctivitis, abortion,
and pneumonia. Young animals or old animals that may have
decreased immune function are at highest risk. In a recent case report,
two cats from the same household were affected with Salmonella. One
cat was 10 weeks old, and the other was almost 15 years old. Both cats
were fed raw diets contairing beef, and Salmonella was isolated from
both the diet and the tissues from the cats. Neither cat survived.
Cases of human salmonellosis due to direct contact with infected
arimals are well documented. Humans at highest risk of infection and
mortality are children younger than 9 years of age and the elderly.
18 SECTION 1 NUTRITION AND DIETARY MANAGEMENT
Human exposure can occur by direct contact with pets consuming
contaminated diets. In a recent study, 40 dogs consuming raw diets
were evaluated for fecal shedding of Salmonella and were compared
to 160 dogs not consuming a raw diet. Fecal shedding of Salmonella
was found in up to 25% of dogs consuming raw diets. All dogs errolled
in this study routinely worked as therapy dogs visiting human patients
in health-care facilities or retirement homes. As a result of this study
the recommendation was made that dogs consuming raw diets should
be excluded from therapy programs due to the increased risk of
Salmonella exposure for human patients.
Clostridium botufinum
Clostridium botulinum are gram-posiftive, anaerobic bacteria that are
commorly found in the soil. These bacteria commorly contaminate
raw meat, dead animal tissues, and vegetables. With anaerobic condi-
fions (as in uncooked meat), Clostridium botulinum can produce an
extremely potent toxin that, when ingested, can block the neurotrans-
mitter acetylcholine. Clirical signs occur between 12 hours and 6 days
starting in the rear limbs and progressing to all four limbs. The toxin
is heat sensitive, and heating at 212°F for 10 minutes is sufficient to
destroy the toxin.
Staphyfococcusaureus
Staphylococus species are commorly found on the skin of humans
and other arimals. Ingestion of Staphyfococcus aureus (S. aureus) is the
most common cause of foodborne illness in humans. Ingestion of toxin
produced by S. aureus typically will cause nausea and vomiting within
2 to 4 hours, with spontaneous recovery in 24 to 48 hours. Dogs and
cats are fairly resistant to the S. aureus enterotoxin. S. aureus bacteria
are easily destroyed by heating. but the toxin produced can survive
heating and the carning process.
Escherichia coli
 E. coli is a common foodborne pathogen in people, but its role in
foodborne illness in dogs and cats is unclear. E. coli has been impli-
cated in a syndrome in racing greyhounds that is characterized by
ulceration of the extremities and kidney damage.
Bacillus cereus
B. cereus is found in soil, grains, cereal products, and other foods,
and it is commonly found in uncooked rice. B. cereus causes vomiting
CHAPTER 2FOODSAFETY
19
and diarrhea in people, but it is not a significant pathogen in dogs and
cats. However, if pet food is exposed to moisture and warm tempera
tures, these bacteria can rapidly reproduce. Thus, pet diets containing
a high amount of water (such as homemade diets) should rot be
exposed to high ambient temperatures for a prolonged period of
time.
Rickettsia
Neorickettsia helminthoeca is a rickettsia that causes salmon poison
ing. Raw salmon can contain a parasitic fluke, Nanophyetus salmincola.
When this fluke is ingested in raw salmon, it matures in about a week
and attaches to the intestinal liring. The rickettsia in the fluke can then
invade the bloodstream and cause anl acute infection. Clirical signs
include vomiting. bloody diarrhea, fever, dehydration, and enlarged
lymph nodes. Mortality can be high if treatment is not initiated early
in the course of the infection.
 Biogenic Amines
acids in dead animal tissues. Biogeric amines include histamine,
putrescine, and cadaverine. Histamine is commonly found in spoiled
fish and is involved in scombroid fish poisoning. Scombroid fish
include tuna, mackerel, and sardines. Histamine causes an allergic-
type reaction, and clirical signs include flushing, nausea, diarrhea,
rash, facial swelling, disorientation, and respiratory distress. Scombroid
fish poisoring is rarely fatal.
■ Metals
Metals can accumulate in plants and animal tissues, and food can
serve as a source of contamination. Metal contamination can also occur
during food preparation. Most metal toxicities in dogs and cats involve
lead, zinc, cadmium, and arseric. With careful preparation of home-
made diets, the poterfial for metal toxicity is low.
 Other Sources
Chocolate
Feeding chocolate to pets should be avoided. Chocolate contains
theobromine, which is a compound similar to caffeine. The dog is very
20  SECTION 1 NUTRITION AND DIETARY MANAGEMENT
sensitive to even a small amount of theobromine because it is not
metabolized very rapidly. The half-life of theobromine in humans is 6
hours, whereas it is 17.5 hours in the dog.
In the dog, a very small amount of theobromine can be potentially
fatal, and a theobromine dose of 45mg/lb body weight can be toxic.
   s     z s
theobromine. Cocoa powder contains an even higher level of theobro-
mine. Semisweet and milk chocolate contain lower amounts of theo
bromine; however, consumption of just &oz of semisweet chocolate
can be lethal for a midsized dog. One to 1.5lb of milk chocolate can
be fatal for a 25-lb dog. A dog could easily consume this much
chocolate.
Clirical signs of theobromine toxicity include vomiting. diarrhea,
is to induce vomiting, as there is no specific antidote.
Onions and Garlic
Orions contain n-propyl disulfide, which, when ingested, can
damage the lipid membranes of red blood cells. This membrane
damage results in the irreversible denaturing of hemoglobin, and
Heinz bodies are produced in the red blood cells. Heinz body anemia,
in which red blood cells are destroyed, is the result. Dogs and cats are
susceptible to Heinz body anemia, and ingestion of as little as 5-10g
   s        g
 s a   e e  s 
Heinz body anemia has also occurred in cats. Garlic is also a member
of the orion family, and chroric ingestion has caused anemia and
dermatitis in dogs. The feeding of orions and garlic to pets should be
restricted.
Grapes and Raisins
Recently, toxicity from ingesting grapes or raisins has been
of raisins or grapes, some dogs develop clirical signs of acute renal
failure within 48 hours. In four dogs originally described with acute
renal failure from eating grapes or raisins, ingestion was estimated to
be from 0.41 to 1.1 oz of grapes or raisins per kilogram of body weight.
Not all dogs that consume grapes or raisins develop clirical signs
of acute renal failure. Of 132 dogs that had ingested grapes or raisins,
33% developed acute renal failure and 25% had no clirical signs. The
cause of renal failure associated with grapes or raisins is unknown,
but it is speculated that ochratoxin may be a toxic component. An
CHAPTER 2 FOOD SAFETY
21
 increase in serum calcium is common and was detected in 93% of dogs.
Of 40 dogs with acute renal failure from ingestion of grapes or raisins,
42% failed to survive, even with extensive treatment. For those that
do survive, therapy is intensive and requires several weeks of hospi-
talization. Aggressive treatment has been recommended for any dogs
suspected of having ingested large, or even small, quantities of grapes
or raisins, including induction of vomiting, gastric lavage, and admin-
istration of activated charcoal
Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE)
Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is the techrical name for
mad cow disease, which can affect cattle. It is caused by a modified
lype of protein called a prion protein, which has some very urusual
characteristics. The disease has a very long incubation period, from 3
to 9 years. Prion proteins affect the brain, giving the infected brain a
spongelike appearance. Thus, BSE is a slowly progressive degenera-
five disease of the nervous system. Affected cattle show incoordina-
tion, aggression, nervousness, and loss of body weight. There is no
treatment, and most die within 6 months.
Prion diseases are found in a number of species, including cows,
humans, sheep, goats, mink, elk, mule deer, and cats. A prion-type
disease has recently been described in cats in the Urited Kingdom, but
no cases have beent seen in the Urited States. In sheep, the disease is
called scrapie, and in mink it is called transmissible mink encepha-
lopathy (TME).
Prion proteins are located in nervous system tissues (brain and
spinal cord), and the disease is transmitted by eating these tissues. In
Britain, cows contracted BSE by eating scrapie-infected sheep meal.
People may be infected with prion disease by eating brains and
nervous tissue from irfected arimals. Striated muscle meats, fat, and
           
causing agent. The potential for BSE to infect dogs and cats is very
low.
Prevention of Foodborne Illness
The prevention of foodborne illness involves limiting exposure to
garbage and dead animal tissue and proper preparation and storage
of foods. Any food that is moldy, discolored, or has an off odor should
not be used. All utensils and bowls used to prepare food should be
clean and washed after every use. Bowls used for feeding should be
22 SECTION 1 NUTRITION ANDDIETARY MANAGEMENT
washed daily. All homemade diets should be cooked for a minimum
of 10 minutes at 180°F, and the internal temperature of any cooked
meat should be verified with a meat thermometer. When feeding, any
food that is not consumed within 2 to 4 hours should be thrown away
if the ambient temperature is above 50°F. Prepared diets should be
kept refrigerated prior to feeding and should not be kept more than 5
days. Food should be stored covered and should be inspected for mold
growth prior to feeding.

CHAPTER3
Nutrients
Expression of Nutrient Content
The nutrients present in diets can be expressed in a number of differ-
ent ways. The guaranteed analysis on a pet food label expresses nutri-
ent levels on an "as-fed" basis. To arrive at these values, the rutrients
have been measured in the firished product and represent what is
being consumed by the pet. The amount of water is not taken into
account in this determination, and dry pet foods will appear to have
 s     sd r 
contain a considerable amount of water. Homemade diets typically
have a high water content, and thus the percentages of nutrients will
appear low on an as-fed basis.
A better way to compare diets is to look at nutrients on a dry matter
(DM) basis. For this determination, the amount of water in each diet
lar rutrient if no water were present in the diet; thus, it is a percentage
of the dry matter of the diet. In this marner, percentages of rutrients
can be compared independently of the amount of water present in the
finished product. For example, a dry diet may contain 18% protein on
an as-fed basis and contain 10% water (which means that there is 90%
dry matter). Divide the 18% protein by 90% DM and multiply by 100%
to get a protein content of 20% on a dry matter basis (sometimes
expressed as 20% DM). A wet diet may contain 8% protein on an
as-fed basis and contain 60% water (which means there is 40% dry
matter). Divide the 8% protein by 40% DM and multiply by 100% to
get a protein content of 20% on a dry matter basis. Thus, these two
23

SECTION 1 NUTRITION ANDDIETARY MANAGEMENT
 s      n     s
though they appear be quite different when considered on an as fed
basis.
A more accurate method of comparing foods is to calculate the
amount of rutrient on a "metabolizable energy" (ME) basis. The ME
   r   n no    si
this method, nutrients are expressed as a percentage or as grams
per 10o0kcal of ME. For example, a homemade diet may contain
11% protein on an as-fed basis, and this diet provides 1600kcal/1000g
(or 160kcal/100g) of prepared diet. The 11% protein represents 11g
protein/100g prepared diet, so if we divide the 1lg protein/100g
diet by 160kcal/100g diet, this diet provides 0.06875g protein/kcal;
or multiplying by 1000, we get 68.75g protein/1000kcal. Dogs and
cats consume a diet based on their energy needs. Thus, in this
marner the  exact  amounts  of  nutrient  consumed  can be
determined.
Another way of expressing protein, carbohydrate, and fat is to look
at the percentages of the total kilocalories in the diet provided by each
of these nutrients. For example, a homemade diet may contain 11%
protein, 6% fat, and 45% carbohydrate on an as-fed basis, with 63%
water (37% DM). On a DM basis, the percentage of protein is essen-
tially 30% (30% protein DM), the percentage of fat is 16% (16% fat DM).
and the percentage of carbohydrate is 45% (45% carbohydrate DM)
Protein and carbohydrate provide approximately 3.5kcal/g. and fat
provides approximately 8.5kcal/g. Thus, the energy provided by
protein is 30% times 3.5kcal/g, or 105kcal, and the energy provided
by fat and carbohydrate are 136 kcal and 157.5kcal, respectively, for a
total of 398.5kcal. The percentage of energy in the diet from protein is
then 105 kcal/398.5kcal * 100%, or approximately 26%. The percentage
of energy in the diet from fat and carbohydrate is 34% and 40%,
respectively.
Ingredient Selection
Ingredients used to formulate diets should be foods with high
dients for human consumption is high. As the quality of ingredients
used in diets increases, so does the digestibility, and digestibility
of 89% for protein, 95% for fat, and 88% for carbohydrates are
possible. Diets with low digestibility tend to produce increased
flatulence and larger stool volumes. In general, ingredients of arimal
CHAPTER 3 NUTRIENTS
origin are better digested by dogs and cats than are ingredients of
plant origin.
Homemade diets can be formulated using basic information on the
nutrient composition for all food ingredients. This information pro-
vides the content of calories, protein, fat, carbohydrate, fiber, amino
acids, vitamins, and minerals for each ingredient included in the diet.
Nutrient composition of foods can be obtained from the U.S.
  ss   (   
formulation software (Food Processor SQL, ESHA Research, Salem,
OR). Dietary requirements for the dog and cat are published yearly by
the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). Dietary
requirements are determined by the Carine and Feline Nutrition
Expert subcommittees of AAFCO, and these values differ from those
of the National Research Council (NRC) Committee on Animal
Nutrition. The NRC establishes mirimum nutrients needed for growth
based on highly purified diets. The AAFCO requirements take into
account differences in ingredient digestibility and sources of vitamins
and minerals. The AAFCO Dog and Cat Food Nutrient Profiles are
used to substantiate the adequacy of foods that are "complete and
balanced." Mirimum levels and maximum levels for some nutrients
have been determined. Nutrient levels are expressed on a DM basis
and are also corrected for ME of the diet. Nutrient requirements

and 3.4.
Formulating a complete and balanced homemade diet is not a
simple task due to the fact that many amino acids, vitamins, and min-
erals must be considered. Most human diet programs such as those
found on the Internet are inadequate for use in formulating pet diets.
Review of Nutrients
Proteins
Proteins have many functions. They are important in muscle func-
tion, are the major structural components of collagen, are enzymes that
catalyze metabolic reactions, and serve as hormones. Proteins also act
as carrier substances in the blood and contribute to the regulation of
acid-base balance. In addition, proteins are important in immune
system function.
Proteins are composed of 22 different amino acids, most of which
can be synthesized in the body (nonessential amino acids). However,

10 amino acids carnot be made in the body, and these are termed
essential amino acids (Table 3.5). These amino acids must be provided
by the diet. An essential amino acid is one that the body carnot syn-
thesize at a rate fast enough (from constituents normally in the diet)
for normal growth or maintenance.
Dietary protein is the principal source of ritrogen and provides the
amino acids that are used for protein synthesis. Nitrogen is necessary
for the synthesis of the nonessential amino acids and other molecules
such as purines, nucleic acids, pyrimidines, and neurotransmitters.
The nutritional value of protein de
oends on its amino acid composi-
tion as well as on the efficiency
estion, absorption, and utiliza-
tion. The use of amino acids for
 protein synthesis depends on the
availability to cells of all amino acids in the right proportion and at
the right time. The diet must provide these amino acids; otherwise,

the body mobilizes them from protein in its tissues. Plants can make
all the amino acids they require by synthesizing them from simple
ritrogenous compounds such as ammonia and ritrates. Animals
require most of their dietary ritrogen to be in the form of specific
amino acids.
Different protein sources have different levels of essential amino
acids. Organ and muscle meats, whole egg, and soybeans are examples
of protein sources with high levels of essential amino acids in the
proper proportions. When evaluating a diet, one must also be aware
of how digestible the protein is. Organ and muscle meat protein is
more digestible than soybean meal. Proteins provide approximately
3.5kcal/g ME.
Taurine is an amino acid required only by the cat. Most arimals can
synthesize adequate taurine from methionine and cysteine. Taurine
plays important roles in myocardial and retinal function. Cats can
synthesize a small amount of taurine, but they have a high demand
for it. Cats can use only taurine for bile salt formation and carnot
switch to using glycine when taurine is limited. Taurine is continually
lost in the cat, and thus there is a dietary requirement for taurine.
Taurine is present only in animal tissues, with high concentrations
found in shellfish. Poultry, meat, and fish also contain taurine. Because
of the cat's requirement for taurine, diets formulated for dogs should
not be fed to cats, as those diets may not contain adequate amounts
of this amino acid.
34SECTION 1 NUTRITION ANDDIETARY MANAGEMENT
Biological Value of Proteins
Biological value describes how efficiently a protein is used. This
so sd p pe 'sa s  sd rg y si aa
and cats digest these proteins efficiently, and they provide amino acids
in proportions suitable for tissue protein synthesis. In contrast, the
biological value of most plant proteins is low due to insufficiencies of
specific amino acids and lower digestibility. Careful balancing of pro-
teins from plant sources can improve the protein quality of the diet
and make them suitable for meeting nutritional needs. Diets must
contain more proteins when their biological value is lower or when
they have less than an ideal amino acid profile.
Protein Requirement
The protein requirement is difficult to determine due to the multi-
ple factors that affect it. Protein quality, amino acid composition, diet
energy density, activity level, and nutritional status can all affect the
protein requirement. If very high-quality synthetic proteins are fed,
the requirement for protein in adult dogs is between 4% and 7% of
ME. If lower quality protein sources are used, the protein requirement
may be as high as 20% of ME. Growing animals have a higher protein
requirement. AAFCO requires that carine diets contain 18% protein
 p   d    
Cats have a substantially higher protein requirement; approxi
mately 24% DM protein or 17% of ME is required. AAFCO requires
that feline diets contain 26% DM protein for maintenance and 30% DM
protein for growth and reproduction.
Dynamic State of Body Proteins
Adult arimals have ongoing requirements for dietary protein
because body proteins are in a dynamic state; the body continually
degrades and rebuilds them. Some proteins, such as in the gastroin-
testinal mucosa, turn over rapidly, while others, such as in tendons
rebuilding, the body does not completely reuse the amino acids
released. Dietary amino acids replace those lost during degradation.
When caloric intake is inadequate to meet energy requirements,
body proteins are catabolized and used for energy. When the diet
provides all nutrients needed for energy requirements, amino acids
requirements are less, and minimal protein is degraded. During
disease with fevers, infection, and trauma, extensive body protein can
be lost in much greater amounts than with starvation. Release is aug-
mented by hormones such as cortisol to promote body protein
breakdown.
CHAPTER 3 NUTRIENTS
     p   m  i
body should remain stable; the animal is in ritrogen balance. When
the intake of ritrogen exceeds excretion, there is positive balance and
the arimal stores ritrogen. With a negative balance, body protein is
degraded.
     o      d 
protein. To maintain balance, more protein is required when its bio-
logical value is low and less when that value is high.
Formulation of Diets to Meet Amino Acid Needs
Requirements for dietary protein are based on (1) an arimal's ritro-
gen requirements, (2) an arimal's amino acid requirements, and (3)
the dietary protein's amino acid composition. Nitrogen requirements
are expressed as crude protein requirements. When a diet satisfies
these requirements, it is necessary to find the first limiting amino acid.
Dietary levels of that amino acid indicate the least amount of protein
necessary to satisfy all essential amino acids. Whenn a diet satisfies
requirements for the first limiting amino acid, it satisfies all other
amino acid requirements.
For example, wheat grain protein is low in lysine, and the sulfur
containing amino acids (such as methiorine) are deficient for puppies.
An additional source of protein containing lysine and the sulfur amino
If wheat was fed without any other added protein or amino acids, the
amount fed would have to more than double.
Besides calculating the protein and amino acid requirements, it is

not possible to determine the biological value of a protein from amino
acid or protein analysis of a food. Digestibility and utilization vary
greatly for different proteins. Nonprotein nutrients (such as fiber) in
the diet can influence the digestibility and utilization. Cooking
 Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates include starches, sugars, and fiber and provide a
primary source of energy for most pet foods. Dietary carbohydrate
       s
Carbohydrate sources in pet foods typically include rice, corn, potato.
36  SEcTIOn 1 NuTrITIOn And DIETARY mANAGEmEnT
wheat, soybean, oats, barley, quinoa, and sorghum. Vegetables are
also considered a source of carbohydrate but are much less digestible
than the common starches due to their fiber cortent. The most soluble
and digestible carbohydrates are starches and sugars in plants. The
source and type of processing determines the carbohydrate's digest-
ibility. Rice is highly digestible by dogs and cats, but raw wheat, oats,
   e   s d a d s
compared to rice. Cooking increases the digestibility of all starches,
especially potato starch
Sugars are sometimes included in pet foods and can be highly
digestible in small quantities. Sucrose is found in molasses, honey.
maple syrup, sugar, fruits, and vegetables. Sucrase present in the small
intesfine hydrolyzes sucrose to glucose and fructose. Lactose is usually
found orly in milk products and is digested by lactase. The activity of
lactase decreases when there is little lactose in the diet. Excess sugars
are not completely digested and can cause diarrhea.
Carbohydrate is stored in limited quantity in the body as glycogen.
If excess carbohydrate is consumed, most is stored in the body as fat
  a  a s  so  
adequate dietary carbohydrate, carbohydrate will be used as the
energy source, which allows protein to be used for growth and tissue
repair rather than energy.
Dogs usually tolerate high levels of carbohydrate with no problem;
however, cats tolerate less dietary starch. If excessive carbohydrate is
fed, diarrhea can result because the small intestine cannot digest and
absorb all the carbohydrate present. Some dogs can also have insuf-
          
carbohydrate. The cat is a true carrivore, and the natural diet is mostly
protein and fat and is very low in carbohydrate. Carrivores can convert
amino acids and glycerol for glucose, and cats can maintain normal
blood glucose levels on starvation diets better than other arimals. Cats
are also able to store more glycogen in their liver when fed a high-
proteindiet.
 Dogs may not readily digest galactosides, which are carbohydrates
found in dairy products and soybeans. Galactosides are digested by
urique intestinal enzymes specific for galactosides, and this enzyme
activity may be low if little galactoside has been fed. New foods con-
tairing this carbohydrate should be introduced gradually into the diet
to prevent diarrhea.
Longer-chain carbohydrates (oligosaccharides) containing galac
tose, such as rhamnose, stachyose, and verbacose, form about half the
CHAPTER 3 NUTRIENTS

carbohydrate in soybeans. These carbohydrates are not digested in the
small intestine and are fermented in the colon by bacteria. Fermentation
produces gas, so flatulence is not uncommor. This fermentation also
 ps dr re (   rs 
for the colon and promote water and salt absorpfion.
 Dietary Fiber
Dietary fiber affects carbohydrate digestion and absorption. Dietary
fiber consists of plant materials such as cellulose, hemicellulose, ligrin,
and pectins. Nonplant cell wall sources of fiber include gums, muci
lages, algal polysaccharides, and modified cellulose.
Dietary fibers are insoluble or soluble. Insoluble fibers consist pri-
marily of cellulose and some hemicelluloses. They also include ligrin,
which represents a small part of dietary total fiber. Insoluble fibers are
the structural building material of cell walls. Insoluble fiber is found
in whole wheat flour, bran, grains, and vegetables. The bonds present
in insoluble fibers carnot be broken down by the erzymes in the
        
all other nonstructural and indigestible plant carbohydrates. Soluble
fibers such as pectin, guar gum, and carboxymethylcellulose absorb
water and form gels; they slow gastric emptying, reduce nutrient
absorption, and increase intestinal transit rate. Increased dietary fiber
reduces digestibility of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats and affects
absorption for some vitamins and minerals. Water-insoluble fibers
such as wheat cereal bran and cellulose reduce digestion and absorp-
tion the least.
Fiber increases fecal volume and promotes more frequent defeca-
tion. Fiber from cereal grains also increases fecal volume by absorbing
water.
Bacteria present in the large intestine have the ability to partially
break down some fiber sources. This fermentatior creates short-chain
fatty acids (SCFA) such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate. Soluble
fibers are highly fermentable, whereas insoluble fibers are not fer
mented. Beet pulp, rice bran, and some gums are moderately fer-
mented. Pectin, guar gum, oat bran, and some vegetable fibers are
readily fermented.
The SCFAs produced during fiber fermentation do not contribute
sigrificantly to the energy provided by the diet. However, they do
serve as an energy source for the intestinal epithelial cells. Fatty acids
also promote coloric salt and water absorption. Excess fermentable
fiber results in diarrhea caused by large amounts of SCFAs.
38
SECTION 1 NUTRITION AND DIETARY MANAGEMENT
Fiber is rarely added to homemade diets, yet these diets provide
enough fiber to supply coloric nutritional needs. In the wild, dogs and
   's     i  
probably have a low requirement for fiber. Homemade diets typically
contain less than 1.4% fiber unless they contain large amounts of veg-
etables, beans, peas, or bran-rich cereals.
The amount of dietary fiber can be altered for different conditions;
for example, an increased amount is often recommended for diets
designed for weight reduction. Fiber reduces the digestibility of other
nutrients and may reduce appetite or hunger by filling the stomach.
If fiber is increased, then there must be added attention to the rest of
the diet to ensure that it is balanced and that enough will be consumed
to meet rutritional needs. Increased fiber can also cause an increase in
stool volume.
■Fats
        
    q 1  q  1 r  
dogs, the minimum nutrient requirement for fat is 5% of the diet in
adults, and 8% for growth and reproduction. In cats, the minimum
nutrient requirement for fat is 9% for all life stages. As fat increases in
    d 's o  s o
higher fat content will typically decrease the volume of food ingested.
High-fat diets are important to supply the energy needs of very active
dogs, hard-working dogs (e.g., sled dogs), and lactating animals.
Dietary fat contributes to the palatability of the diet, and the texture
and "mouth-feel" of the diet. Fat can provide a significant portion the
      o n   s
levels of fat in their diet to maintain good body condition. Feeding
highly palatable diets that are high in fat can contribute to overeating
steatorrhea (the passage of undigested fat). Excess dietary fat reduces
food consumption, which can cause deficiency of other nutrients
unless those dietary levels increase. Protein, iodine, and thiamin levels
should especially be augmented when dietary fat increases
Essential Fatty Acids
Dietary fat is necessary as a source of essential fatty acids. In the
dog, linoleic acid and linoleric acid are required in the diet. In cats

linoleic acid, linolenic acid, and arachidonic acid are required because
cats carnot convert linoleic acid to arachidoric acid. Linoleic and ara-
chidoric acid are omega-6 fatty acids, and linoleric acid is an omega-3
fatty acid. Fat sources differ greatly in their concentrations of omega-6
and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-6 fatty acids can be found in meat
products, egg yolks, and vegetable oils. Arachidoric acid, however, is

borage oil and evening primrose oil). Omega-3 fatty acids are present
in high levels in fish oils (Table 3.6); they can also be found in flaxseed
oil, wheat germ oil, canola oil, and soybean oil. Fish sources of omega-
3 fatty acids provide long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic
acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]), which are used in
metabolism. Plant sources (flaxseed, canola, soybean, wheat germ)
contain high levels of linoleric acid, which needs to be converted to
EPA and DHA for metabolism. Cats are unable to convert linoleric
acid to EPA and DHA and thus should be supplemented with a fish

Research has also suggested that not orly is the ratio of omega-6 to
important at the cellular level. The use of omega-3 fatty acids to modu-
late inflammation is a major focus of research. Omega-6 fatty acids are
utilized in the synthesis of compounds that strongly promote inflam-
mation. Omega-3 fatty acids are utilized in the synthesis of similar
moting inflammation. Thus, there is the potential to decrease the
inflammatory response with dietary omega-3 fatty acids.
In dogs, linoleic acid should be provided at 1% of the dry weight
of the diet for maintenance, growth, and reproduction (about 2% of
calories). Cats require 0.50% DM linoleic acid and 0.02% DM arachi-
doric acid in a diet contairing 40o0kcal ME/kg. If cat diets do not
contain adequate arachidoric acid, decreases in platelets and platelet
function is observed, and queens fail to deliver living kittens. Decreased
growth rate, poor coat condition, and impaired wound healing have
also been seen with arachidonic acid deficiency in cats.
Fatty Acid Deficiency and Excess
Low-fat diets are not very palatable, thus essential fatty acid defi-
ciency is not common in dogs and cats and usually only occurs with
a long period of deficiency. Diets that have adequate levels of fat when
formulated but that have been stored improperly can result in fatty
acid deficiency. Oxidation of fats in foods occurs when the food is
        
dation is termed rancidity. In commercial pet foods, antioxidants are
typically added to help prevent the oxidation of fats; homemade diets
usually do not have antioxidants (preservatives) added, so they should
be made in very small batches and stored properly to prevent
rancidity.
erosclerosis can be a result of high-fat diets; however, due to major
differences in lipoprotein metabolism, dogs and cats rarely develop
atherosclerosis unless there is an underlying condition altering lipid
metabolism (hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, or primary lipid
defects). If polyunsaturated fats are present in excess, there is an
increase in the vitamin E requirement. In cats, pansteatitis (yellow fat
disease) can occur if the diet is high in polyunsaturated fats and low
in vitamin E. Feeding a high-fat diet can potentially cause pancreatitis,
but this association is not clear. Many dogs with pancreatitis have a
CHAPTER 3 NUTRIeNTS
41
history of eating a fat-rich diet or consuming fatty meat scraps.
However, normal dogs fed a 70% fat diet do not usually develop acute
pancreatitis.
High-fat diets car result in maldigestion or malabsorption, where
unabsorbed fat enters the colon; normally, very little fat reaches this
point. Bacteria that normally live in the colon transform dietary fats
to fatty compounds that are essentially the same as the active ingredi-
ent in castor oil (ricinoleic acid). By making one small change in normal
fat, bacteria convert it to a potent laxative. Ricinoleic-like compounds
damage the coloric mucosa, stimulate coloric water secretion, and
stimulate intestinal motility, all of which contribute to diarrhea.
Therefore, most diets recommended for the management of chronic
diarrhea are low in fat, even for dogs and cats with no loss in their
ability to digest and absorb fats.
■Water
The most essential nutrient for dogs and cats is water. A dog can
lose all its body fat and one-half its protein and still survive. Signs of
deficiencies of other nutrients can take long periods of time to develop;
however, this is not the case with a deficiency of water. In dogs, clirical
signs of water deficiency can occur with as little as a 5% loss of body
water. Death can occur if 15% of body water is lost. A supply of fresh,
good-quality water should be available at all times. The average dog
requires between 50 and 90mL water per kilogram of body weight per
( rd pm Apoq ot d so   1 Axd) A
Cats are better able to tolerate a lack of water than are dogs. This
is in part due to the cat's greater ability to concentrate urine and
prevent water loss. Cats require between 10 and 45mL water per kilo-
gram of body weight per day (approximately 4 to 1 cup per 10 lb body
weight per day).
 Vitamins and Minerals
Vitamins and minerals are important components of an animal's
diet and are required for the normal functioring of every body system.
Vitamins are separated into two groups: fat-soluble and water-soluble
vitamins. Fat-soluble vitamins include vitamins A, D, E, and K and
are stored within the fat of the body. Water-soluble vitamins are the
B vitamins (Bi2, thiamin, riboflavin, and pyridoxine), vitamin C, pan-
totheric acid, biotin, niacin, folic acid, and choline. Excesses of the
water-soluble vitamins are excreted in the urine. Minerals are classi
42  SECTION 1 NUTRITION AND DIETARY MANAGEMENT
fied as macrominerals and microminerals. Microminerals are present
in very small quantities in the body and include iron, zinc, copper,
manganese, iodine, and selerium. Macrominerals are present in
slightly higher concentrations and include calcium, phosphorus, mag-
nesium, potassium, sodium, and chlorine.
Interactions between minerals occur, so oversupplementation of
one particular mineral may result in a deficiency of another mineral.
Well-formulated pet foods are developed to keep vitamins and miner
als in proper balance. Many vitamins are destroyed very easily with
cooking: therefore, vitamin supplements should be added to the diet
after the other ingredients have been cooked.
Vitamins
Vitamin A
Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin that is important in vision and
maintenance of the skin. Signs of deficiency include decreased vision,
 an no s   p p 's 
abnormal bone remodeling, lameness, and death. Fish liver oils contain.
high levels of vitamin A; milk, liver, and egg yolks also contain vitamin
A. Dogs can convert carotenoid into vitamin A; however, cats are
unable to produce vitamin A and must receive a source of vitamin A
in their diet.
Vitamin D
Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that is required for normal
bone growth. Signs of deficiency include bone malformations
(rickets) characterized by bowing of the legs, thickering of the joints,
 n        
    s      
lage and muscle. There are few food sources rich in vitamin D; most
foods contain very little. Cod liver oil is the most concentrated
source; egg yolks, liver, and some fish contain a moderate amount.
Dog and cats do not synthesize appreciable vitamin D in their skin
with sunlight exposure, thus diets should be supplemented with
vitamin D to ensure adequate intake. Vitamin D deficiency resulting
in nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism is one of the most
made diets.
Vitamin E
Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin that acts as a biological antioxi-
dant and is required for normal reproduction. A deficiency of vitamin
CHAPTER 3 NUTRIENTS
43
E can lead to decreased reproductive performance, retinal degenera-
fion, and impairment of the immune system. There is no known toxic-
ity. Food sources rich in vitamin E include wheat germ, corn oil,
soybean oil, and surflower oil. Egg yolk can provide some vitamin E
as well.
Vitamin K
Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin that is required for blood cloting.
Vitamin K is not added to pet foods because the bacteria present in
the intestine can synthesize all the vitamin K that is necessary.
Hemorrhage is the major sign of vitamin K deficiency. There is no
known toxicity. Foods with a high vitamin K concentration include
green, leafy plants such as spinach, kale, cabbage, and cauliflower;
liver and eggs are an adequate source. The large intestine bacteria can
synthesize vitamin K, but antibiotics can interfere with vitamin K
production.
Thiamin (Vitamin B)
Thiamin is very important in the functioring of the nervous system.
Deficiencies are typically caused by a diet of raw fish, which contains
thiaminase. Signs of deficiency include incoordination, weakness, and
seizures. There is no known toxicity. Foods rich in thiamin include
pork, beef, liver, wheat germ, whole grains, and legumes.
Riboflavin(VitaminB2)
Riboflavin is important in many enzyme reactions in metabolism.
Signs of deficiency include decreased reproductive performance,
dry skin, weakness, and anemia. There is no known toxicity. Foods
rich in riboflavin include milk, kidney, liver, whole grains, and
vegetables.
Pyridoxine is important in the formation of blood and in protein
metabolism. Signs of deficiency include anemia and seizures. There is
no known toxicity. Foods rich in pyridoxine include liver, kidney, fish,
wheat germ, and whole grains.
VitaminBz(Cobalamin)
Vitamin B, is important in the formation of blood and for synthesis
of myelin. Deficiency probably does not occur except as an inherited
disorder seen in some giant schnauzers and border collies.
Concentrations may be low in some intestinal disorders. There is no
44
SECTION 1 NUTRITION AND DIETARY MANAGEMENT
known toxicity. Vitamin B2 is found orly in arimal products, includ-
ing meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products.
Vitamin C
Vitamin C is not required in the diet of dogs and cats because it is
synthesized in the liver. Vitamin C is required in the diet of guinea
pigs, primates (including humans), and a few other species. Vitamin
C is important in collagen synthesis and in many other metabolic reac-
 s ss   go  dd  'so
infection (decreased immune function), and muscle and joint pain.
There is no known toxicity.
Biotin
Biotin is necessary for protein and fatty acid metabolism. Signs of
deficiency are rare, but may occur if a high quantity of raw egg whites
(which contain avidin) are fed. Deficiency is not a problem if whole
raw or cooked eggs are fed. Signs of deficiency include scaly skin, hair
loss, and diarrhea. There is no known toxicity. Foods rich in biotin
include eggs, liver, milk, legumes, and nuts. Antibiotic use can cause
an increase in the biotin requirement because this decreases the bacte-
rial population of the large intestine.
FolicAcid(Folate)
Folate is required for many metabolic reactions and the formation
          
ders. There is no known toxicity. Foods rich in folate include green,
leafy vegetables, liver, and kidney Folic acid can be synthesized by
dogs and cats in the large intestine.
Choline
Choline is important for normal liver function and as a part of cell
membranes. Choline can be synthesized by the body. Signs of defi
ciency include liver disease and prolonged blood-clotting time. An
excess choline intake can result in diarrhea. Foods rich in choline
include egg yolk, organ meat, legumes, dairy product, and grains.
Pantothenic Acid
 Pantotheric acid is important in many enzyme reactions in metabo
lism. Signs of deficiency include scaly skin, hair loss, poor growth, and
include liver, kidney, egg yolk, dairy products, and legumes.
CHAPTER 3 NUTRIENTS
Niacin
Niacin is important in many enzyme reactions in metabolism. Signs
of deficiency include loss of appetite, bad breath, increased salivation,
diarrhea, and emaciation. Excess intake results in itching and burring
skin. Foods rich in riacin include meat, legumes, and grains. Dogs can
        
however, carnot synthesize riacin, and it must be supplied in the diet.
Minerals
Calcium
Calcium is important in the formation and maintenance of bones
and teeth. Signs of deficiency include lameness, bone demineraliza-
tion, and an increased incidence of fractures. During lactation, signs
include seizures and tetany (eclampsia). Excess intake of calcium
results in growth retardation and severe bone and joint abnormalities.
The dietary calcium/phosphorus ratio is very important for proper
skeletal development. Foods rich in calcium include dairy products

Phosphorus is important in the formation and mainterance of bones
and teeth. A deficiency of phosphorus is very rare. A sign of deficiency
is depraved appetite. Excess phosphorus ingestion usually results
from feeding an all-meat diet, which results in a calcium deficiency
As well as signs of calcium deficiency, excess phosphorus promotes
and organ meats.
Potassium
Potassium is important in maintenance of body water, many erzyme
reactions, nerve impulses, and proper cardiac functioring. A lack of
potassium results in the loss of appetite, weakness, head drooping.
incoordination, and paralysis. Toxicity usually does not occur except
in renal failure wher potassium is not excreted. Excess potassium is
toxic to the heart and can lead to death. Dietary sources rich in potas-
sium include meats, poultry, fish, and most vegetables.
Sodium
Sodium is important in maintenance of body water and maintains
nerve cells and muscle fibers. Signs of deficiency include a depraved
appetite, weight loss, and slow growth. High levels of dietary sodium
result in increased urinary excretion of sodium and increased water

softener salt. Signs include seizures and death. Dietary sources rich in
sodium include dairy products, meat, poultry, fish, and egg whites.
Chloride
Chloride is important in maintenance of body water and acid-base
balance. Increases or decreases in body chlorine typically only occur
in disease states such as prolonged vomiting, renal disease, etc. Foods
rich in sodium are also rich in chloride.
Magnesium
Magnesium is important for normal muscle and nerve function.
Signs of deficiency include weakness and seizures. Excess magnesium
results in diarrhea and has been implicated as a cause of feline lower
urinary tract disease. Foods rich in magnesium include whole grains,
legumes, and dairy products.
Sulfur
Sulfur is required for the synthesis of chondroitin sulfate found in
cartilage, insulin, heparin, and glutathione. It is a constituent of biotin
and thiamin and the amino acids cystine and methionine. Sulfate
present in the diet is poorly absorbed, but sulfur deficiency has not
cystine and methionine.
lron
Iron is important in the formation of blood cells. Iron deficiency
results in anemia and is typically caused by chronic blood loss rather
than dietary deficiency. Signs of toxicity include weight loss, loss of
appetite, and death. Foods rich in iron include liver, kidney, egg yolk,
fish, legumes, and whole grains.
Copper
Copper is needed for iron transport and for the formation of
blood cells. Copper deficiency results in anemia. An excess copper
intake may result in liver disease. Liver is the richest dietary source of
copper.
Manganese
Manganese is important for reproductive function and joint forma-
tion. Signs of deficiency include decreased reproductive performance,
abortion, stiffness, and bone abnormalities. Excess manganese also

results in decreased reproductive performance. Foods rich in manga-
nese include legumes and whole grains.
Zinc
Zinc is important for normal skin, sense of taste, and immune func-
fion. Signs of deficiency include crusty skin lesions, dry hair coat,
decreased testicular size, and diarrhea. Excess zinc intake results in
vomiting and may cause calcium and copper deficiencies. Meat and
eggs provide a highly absorbable source of zinc.
lodine
Iodine is important for normal thyroid gland function. Signs of
deficiency include thyroid disorders, hair loss, and drowsiness. Excess
iodine intake also results in thyroid disorders.
Selenium
Selerium is important for normal muscle function. Signs of defi-
ciency include skeletal disorders, weakness, and heart disease. Excess
selenium may result in vomiting, weakness, and death. Foods rich in
selerium include grains, meat, and fish.
Chromium
Chromium functions to enhance the activity of insulin. Low chro-
mium intake may be associated with the development of diabetes.
Unique Nutritional Needs of Cats
Cats have a number of urique nutritional needs, and their diets must
be formulated differently from carine diets. Feline diets must provide
proteins containing essential amino acids for which cats have an abso-
lute requirement. Dietary proteins must also provide more ritrogen
than for most other arimals because they do not conserve ritrogen as
well as do other animals. Their enzyme activities for metabolizing
amino acids are greater than in other arimals, and that acfivity does
not decrease when they eat a low-protein diet. Excess amino acid
Cats need 18%-20% of total calories as protein for growth and
12%-13% for adult maintenance. Thus, cats need two to three times
more protein thar do most other arimals under comparable circum-
stances. The 18%-20% of total calories for a growing kitten represents
48
SECTION1NUTRITIONANDDIETARYMANAGEMENT
about 25% of the dry weight of the diet. Diets formulated for dogs
contain inadequate protein for feeding cats.
Cats carnot synthesize the essential amino acid citruline, which is
          
Therefore, feline diets must contain arginine to meet the need for
citrulline. Cats fed a diet lacking arginine develop hyperammonemia
and show clirical signs of illness within several hours. Ammoria
accumulates because it is not converted to urea; arginine and citrulline
are needed for that conversion. Cats have only a limited ability to
synthesize the essential amino acid taurine from sulfur-containing
amino acids. Therefore, a cat's diet must provide taurine; diets should
also be rich in sulfur-containing amino acids. Diets low in protein, and
therefore sulfur amino acids, are more likely to induce taurine
deficiency.
Taurine is the most abundant free amino acid in the body. It is not
incorporated into body proteins. Its many important functions include
being a precursor for bile salts (both cats and dogs have an obligatory
and continuous requirement for taurine to make bile salts to replace
what is lost continuously in the feces). Taurine is also involved in
growth and maturation of nervous tissue, maintenance of normal
vision, normal heart function, and female reproduction. Taurine is
found in all animal tissues, but not in plant materials.
Since taurine is free in arimal tissues (not incorporated in proteins),
it readily leaches out in water. Cooking meat in water and discarding
the water can greatly reduce its taurine content. Proteins from plants

provide no taurine.
Within the last decade, two diseases, dilated cardiomyopathy and
central retinal degeneration, appeared in cats fed diets containing
insufficient taurine. In only some animals can these problems be

is adequate in any feline diet.
Cats show low tolerance for the amino acid glutamic acid. Excess
amounts cause sporadic vomifing and thiamin deficiency. Glutamic
acid is abundant in vegetable proteins and is comparatively low in
arimal proteins.
Cats also have some urique vitamin needs. Cats do not have the
ability to convert carotene to vitamin A. Lacking the enzyme for that

Canine and Feline Energy
Requirements
All arimals require a source of energy. Balance occurs when energy
intake matches energy expenditure: a positive balance occurs when
intake exceeds expenditure, and a negative balance occurs when
expenditure exceeds intake. The resting energy requirement (RER)
accounts for most energy expenditure and represents the energy
body surface area and body weight play a role in determining RER.
In addition, muscle activity, stress, heat production to maintain body
temperature, and meal digestion require energy and contribute to the
energy requirement. The RER accounts for about 60% of daily energy
expenditure, with about 30% energy expenditure from muscle activity.
Total energy expenditure is impacted by gender, reproductive status,
hormonal status, body composition, nutritional status, and age.
because there is such a variety of size among different dog breeds.
Energy expendifure is related to body surface area and weight; body
surface area as related to body weight decreases as dogs get larger.
Thus, there is not a linear relationship between body weight and
energy expenditure. Calculating the energy requirements of cats is not
as difficult as in dogs because there is not the size variation seen in
different breeds of cats. In general, the energy requirement per pound
of body weight is greatest for the very small breeds and the lowest for
the largest breeds.

SECTION1NUTRITIONANDDIETARYMANAGEMENT
Determining Daily Energy Requirements
Energy is commonly expressed in units of calories or kilocalories
(kcal). A calorie is the amount of heat energy required to raise the
temperature of 1 gram (g) of water from 14.5°Celsius (C) to 15.5°C.
          s
reported as kilocalories; lkcal equals 1oo0 calories. There is some
confusion, as many people refer to kcal as Calories (with a capital C).
There are a rumber of formulas that have been used to calculate
energy requirements for both dogs and cats. No formula is perfect, but
linear formulas are the least accurate; with linear formulas, the energy
needs of very small arimals are underestimated, and they are overes-
limated for larger arimals. One formula that works well for calculat-
ing RER is the formula
For weight, 1 kilogram (kg) is equivalent to 2.2lb. To determine body
weight in kilograms, take the body weight in pounds and divide by
2.2. With this basic formula, different multiplication factors can be
used to estimate the energy needs of dogs and cats with different
reproductive states, life stages, and activity levels.
need to be increased or decreased depending on the individual. Pets
should be fed based on the estimated energy requirement and then
moritored closely for weight gain or loss. Body condition should also
be moritored. Body condition score (BCS) is based on a defined set of
criteria so that a somewhat objective measurement of condition can be
recorded over time. Body condition scoring can be done on a 5-point
or a 9-point scale. With the 5-point BCS scale, BCS 1 represents a very
thin animal: the ribs are easily palpable, with no fat cover, and are
visible, and there is an exaggerated abdominal tuck. BCS 2 represents
an underweight arimal: the ribs are easily palpable, with minimal fat
cover, and an abdominal tuck is present. BCS 3 represents the ideal
body condition: ribs are palpable, with a slight fat cover, but not
readily visible, and there is a slight abdominal tuck. BCS 4 represents
an overweight arimal: ribs are difficult to palpate and are covered by
a moderate layer of fat, there is little abdominal tuck present, and the
o r ss  S  as de  
arimal: ribs are very difficult to palpate under a thick fat layer, there
is a pendulous ventral bulge, no waist is visible, and the back is mark-
edlybroadened.

Daily Energy Requirements for Dogs
■Adult
 The daily energy requirement for adult dogs is based on the resting
whether the dog is intact or neutered. Neutering decreases the activity
level and thus decreases the daily energy requirement. The daily
energy requirements for intact adult dogs can be found in Table 4.1.

*DER = 1.6 × RER (resting energy requirement).
■ Weight Loss
 For weight loss to occur, energy expenditure must be greater than
 the energy intake. The daily requirements for adult dogs that need to
lose weight can be found in Table 4.3. The daily energy requirement
for adult dogs that need to lose weight is calculated by the formula
DER = 1.0 x RER.
 Moderate and Heavy Work
Activity level has a sigrificant impact on the daily energy require-
ment. Short bouts of exercise have a minimal impact on daily energy
requirement, but dogs that regularly participate in strenuous exercise

require sigrificantly higher levels of daily energy to meet their energy
needs. Dogs that may have increased energy requirements include
requirements for adult dogs undergoing moderate work or heavy
work can be found in Tables 4.4 and 4.5, respectively. The daily energy
requirement for adult dogs undergoing moderate work is calculated
  n  A a x  =   a a
dogs undergoing
heavy
work is calculated by the forrmula
DER = 4 x RER. Some dogs undergoing very strenuous activity, such
as sled dogs in training and racing in long races, may have a daily
energy requirement up to eight times the resting energy requirement
(DER = 8 x RER).

BW, body weight.
*DER = 4 x RER (resting energy requirement).
■Growth
Growing puppies require more daily energy than do adult dogs to
support bone, muscle, and tissue growth. Puppies who weigh up to
 about 50% of their adult body weight have the highest energy require-
ment, as a considerable amount of growth is occurring during this
 yo  oi d sdnd rg p  p a d
adult body weight is calculated by the formula DER = 3 x RER. As
puppies get older, the rate of growth slows, and the daily energy
requirement starts to decrease. The daily energy requirement for
 puppies that are 50%-80% of their adult body weight is calculated by
the formula DER = 2.5 x RER. Older puppies are still growing, but at
  sndd  nn   a  as  es
80%-100% of their adult body weight is calculated by the formula
  dn sdnd ng s a Ap a  x 7 = 
of their adult body weight, for puppies 50%-80% of their adult body
weight, and for puppies 80%-100% of their adult body weight can be
found in Tables 4.6, 4.7, and 4.8, respectively.
 For growing puppies, it is important to evaluate body condition on
intake should be moderated, especially in puppies of large breeds.
Maximal growth is not necessarily optimal growth. Rapid growth
leads to abnormal skeletal development. A slower growth rate reduces
Table 4.6. Daily energy requirements (DER) for puppies up to 50% of
their adult weight (about 5 months of age).

the incidence of abnormalities and does not affect the ability of the
puppy to attain its normal adult size. The goal of feeding is to provide
all the essential nutrients while keeping the growing puppy "lean."
Puppies should look trim, with orly a slight layer of fat over the ribs.
The puppy is too fat if the ribs carnot be felt with gentle pressure on
the rib cage. The puppy is too thin if the ribs can be seen easily when
the puppy moves.
■SeniorDogs
It can be difficult to determine the energy needs of the senior pet.
Dogs are considered to be serior when they have reached half their
life expectancy; thus, most are considered to be serior at about 7 years
on body condition, activity level, reproductive status, and the presence
of underlying medical conditions. Many senior dogs are still very
active in performance events, and some females may still be reproduc
ing: thus, these seriors will have increased energy requirements.
However, serior dogs are more prone to obesity and thus would
require a lower daily energy requirement. As dogs get very old, the
daily energy requirement may be higher because of decreased diges-
tion of rutrients and underlying medical conditions.
For the healthy adult serior dog over 7 years of age with reduced
activity level, the daily energy requirement should be decreased to
avoid the occurrence of obesity. The daily energy requirement in this
case is calculated by the formula DER = 1.1 x RER and can be found
in Table 4.9. For older dogs that do not digest nutrients well or that
have underlying medical conditions, the daily energy requirement
could be similar to that for an intact adult dog (Table 4.1). Senior dogs
adjustment of daily energy intake as needed.
Gestation
Daily energy needs increase during gestation, and those needs are
dependent on the prior nutritional status of the bitch, size of the bitch,
 o  i a    a  ss    
the sixth week of gestation the amount of energy fed could be increased.
The daily energy requirement increases during the last few weeks of
gestation, while the fetuses are rapidly growing. The daily energy

*DER = 1.1 × RER (resting energy requirement).
formula DER = 1.8 × RER. The daily energy requirement for the last
weeks of gestation is calculated by the formula DER = 3 x RER. Daily
energy requirements for early and late gestation in dogs are found in
Tables 4.10 and 4.11, respectively.
Lactation
Milk production places the largest rutritional demands on the dam.
She must metabolize very large amounts of nutrients in order to
produce sufficient milk to support the growth of her puppies. Dams
with a large litter may require four times more calories during lacta-
tion than they needed for maintenance. Peak milk production occurs
when the puppies are 4-5 weeks of age, right before they are weaned.

*DER = 3 × RER (resting energy requirement).
puppies is calculated by the formula DER = 4 x RER. The daily energy
requirement for lactation for dams rursing more than four puppies is
calculated by the formula DER = 6 x RER. If dams have very large
litters, the daily energy requirement may be as high as eight times
p ae i p sop rg sn a A 
in Tables 4.12 and 4.13.
Daily Energy Requirements for Cats
■Adult
 The daily energy requirement for adult cats is based on the resting
energy requirement multiplied by a factor that takes into account
whether the cat is intact, neutered, or breeding. Neutering decreases
the activity level and thus decreases the daily energy requirement. The
daily energy requirements for intact adult cats can be found in Table
4.14. For intact adult cats, the daily energy requirement is calculated
by the formula DER = 1.4 x RER. The daily energy requirements for
neutered adult cats can be found in Table 4.15. For neutered adult cats,
the daily energy requirement is calculated by the formula DER =
1.2 x RER. Actively breeding male and female cats have a slightly
  a   pe  a  r
calculated by the formula DER = 1.6 x RER. The daily energy require-
ment for breeding females and males can be found in Table 4.16.

four puppies.a

 Weight Loss
For weight loss to occur, energy expenditure must be greater than
the energy intake. The daily requirements for adult cats that need to
lose weight can be found in Table 4.17. The daily energy requirement
for adult cats that need to lose weight is calculated by the formula

the daily energy requirement starts to decrease. The daily energy
requirement for kittens 4-5 months of age is calculated by the
formula DER = 3 × RER. Growth contirues until about 12 months of
age, but at a slower rate. The daily energy requirement for kittens 
6-8 months of age is calculated by the formula DER = 2.5 × RER, and
the requirement for kittens 9-12 months of age is calculated by the
formula DER = 2 × RER. The daily energy requirements for kittens
up to 4 months of age, 4-5 months of age, 6-8 months of age, and
9-12 months of age can be found in Tables 4.18, 4.19, 4.20, and 4.21,

 Senior Cats
It can be difficult to determine the energy needs of the serior cat.
Cats are considered to be serior when they have reached half their life
 expectancy; thus, most are considered to be senior at about 7 years of
age. The daily energy requirement of a serior cat is dependent on body
condition, activity level, reproductive status, and the presence of
underlying medical conditions. Senior cats are prone to obesity and
thus require a lower daily energy requirement. As cats get very old,
in the ability to digest nutrients and underlying medical conditions.
For the adult senior cat over 7-ll years of age, the daily energy
requirement should be decreased to avoid the occurrence of obesity.

CHAPTER 5
Feeding the Healthy Adult
Dog or Cat
Dogs and cats belong to the order Carrivora. Dogs are omrivores, as
their nutritional needs can be met either by meat or plant sources. Cats
are true carrivores because their rutritional requirements can orly be
met using meat sources in combination with plants.
Nutrition of the Dog
A rumber of factors must be taken into consideration when determin-
          
stress, and envirorment all have an impact on nutritional require-
ments. Neutered dogs require less energy than do intact dogs, and
energy needs are increased in pregnant or lactating females. Sedentary
or overweight dogs need less energy than a normally active dog, and
dogs participating in racing, hunting, or endurance work require more
energy Some breeds, such as Great Danes or Dalmatians, appear to
have higher energy requirements, and some very large breeds, such
as Newfoundlands, require less energy. Nutritional needs of young.
growing dogs are different from those of adults, and older pets may
require less energy. Stresses of boarding. event performance, or the

Water deprivation can quickly lead to dehydration, and death can
Occur. The lack of water leads to death more quickly than a deficiency
           
nutrients.
Protein
Proteins are composed of amino acids, and there are many amino
d r (e i    a  a  s
must be provided in the diet to meet these amino acid requirements.
Protein provided in excess of that required is not stored as protein but
is deaminated by the liver. The by-products of protein breakdown are
excreted by the kidneys. The minimum requirement for protein is
approximately 2.5g protein/kg Bw.75. For adult maintenance, the
daily protein intake should be about 5.0g protein/kg Bwo.7 or approx-
imately 6.5g protein/100 kcal. Diets should contain between 15% and
30% protein dry matter (DM; Table 5.1).
Fat
Fat is an important source of energy and also provides essential
fatty acids. Fat consumption is also necessary for absorption of the
fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K). In the dog, both linoleic acid and
linoleric acid are required because these carnot be synthesized in the
body. Linoleic acid is used for production of all the other omega-6 fatty
acids, and linoleric acid is used for the production of all the other
omega-3 fatty acids. Adequate intake of these essential fatty acids is
necessary for normal skin and coat condition. Fat should comprise at
least 5% DM of the diet, with 1% DM as linoleic acid.

increases, the energy density of the food decreases. Some fiber in the
diet may be beneficial for gut health, and dietary fiber contributes to
"feeling full." Less than 5% DM dietary fiber appears to be
adequate.
 Minerals
Calcium and phosphorus are important for bone health and must

carnot be omitted from homemade diet recipes. Calcium should be
provided in the diet at 0.5%-0.8% DM and phosphorus should be
0.4%-0.6% DM in the diet. It is probably wise to avoid feeding exces-
sive phosphorus as this may accelerate the progression of renal
disease.
 In young, healthy dogs, a high intake of sodium does not appear to
be harmful. However, in certain diseases (kidney disease, heart disease)
obesity), sodium should be restricted because of the presence of hyper
tension. Sodium should be provided at 25-50mg/kg BW /day or at
0.15%-0.4% DM in the diet.
Nutrition of the Cat
As in dogs, a number of factors need to be considered when determin-
ing a diet for a cat. Neutering decreases the energy requirement, and
energy needs are increased in pregnant or lactating cats, as in dogs.
sporting activities as dogs do, but active or stressed cats may require
more energy. There is not a great difference in body size of different
breeds, but some breeds are more docile and therefore less active.
Nutritional needs of cats differ with age, and young, growing kittens
require more energy than the adult or senior cat. The energy require-
ment for different life stages and conditions in the cat can be found in
Chapter 4.
88
SECTION 1 NUTRITION AND DIETARY MANAGEMENT
Water
Water is the most important nutrient for the cat, although cats are
    s  e   q  
Cats have the ability to conserve total body water by producing highly
concentrated urine. Even so, if there is not an adequate supply of
water, cats can become dehydrated and die. In general, cats should
drink about 1 mL of water per kilocalorie requirement. In other words,
if a cat requires 200kcal/day, then it should consume approximately
200mL of water a day. Most homemade diets contain quite a high
percentage of water, so if a homemade diet is fed, the cat may not need
to consume much additional water.
 Protein
Cats require a number of different amino acids in their diet (see
Chapter 3). The amino acids found in meat sources are a better match
for the cat's requirements than are the amino acids present in plant
sources. Thus, most of the protein in the cat's diet should be from a
meat source. In particular, taurine is required by the cat and is not
found in plant sources. The recommended protein concentration in a
diet for adult cats is 30%-45% DM (Table 5.2).
Fat
As in dogs, fat provides a good source of energy and is necessary
for the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. In the cat, linoleic acid, lino-

3 fatty acids are required for proper neurological developments in
neonates. Omega-3 fatty acids are prone to oxidation, and cats can
develop pansteatitis from oxidized omega-3 fatty acids if there is not
sufficient vitamin E in the diet. Dietary fat should be present at greater
than 9% DM. There should be 0.5% DM linoleic acid and 0.02% DM
arachidoric acid in the diet. Palatability of the diet appears to be best
when dietary fat is about 25% DM.
■Fiber
Cats do not require dietary fiber, but a small amount promotes
normal Gl function and helps maintain good stool quality. Dietary
fiber should be present at less than 5% DM for normal cats, but the
fiber content can be increased up to 15% DM for obese cats. Increased
fiber content may also be beneficial for cats with hairballs.
 Minerals
As in dogs, proper levels of calcium and phosphorus are necessary
for bone health. Cats fed exclusively meats are at high risk for the
development of nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism, which
results in a loss of bone density, lameness, and fractures. Meats are
very low in calcium and high in phosphorus; this leads to a calcium
deficiency. Even though the cat is a carrivore, ingredients other than
meat must be provided in their diet to ensure that there is an adequate
intake of calcium. Recommended calcium in the diet is 0.6% DM, and
recommended dietary phosphorus is 0.5% DM. The calcium/phos-
phorus ratio should be maintained between 0.9: 1 and 1.5: 1 for optimal
phosphorus availability. Restriction of dietary phosphorus is impor
tant in both renal disease and when struvite stones are present.
Excess sodium in the diet should be avoided due to the presence of
hypertension. A dietary sodium level of 0.2%-0.5% DM is adequate.
and chloride should be present at a minimum of 0.19% DM.
Potassium is a crifical mineral in cats. High-protein foods promote
the production of acidic urine, which increases the loss of potassium.
Potassium should be fed at a level between 0.6% and 1.0% DM to
prevent a potassium deficiency. Cats lose even more potassium when
90  SECTION 1 NUTRITION AND DIETARY MANAGEMENT
renal disease or diabetes mellitus is present, and higher levels of
dietary potassium may be necessary in these conditions.
Magnesium is important in the development of struvite crystals in
cats. To decrease the risk of struvite crystal formation, dietary magne-
sium should be less than 0.10% DM, or less than 20mg/100kcal.
However, excessive restriction of magnesium is not recommended
either, since this will predispose cats to the formation of oxalate stones.
Urine pH
The ingredients present in the diet and feeding practices determine
the urinary pH. When the urinary pH is less than 6.5, the risk of devel-
oping struvite crystals is decreased. However, if the urine pH drops
below 6.0, metabolic acidosis can occur, which leads to a decrease in
bone density and an increased loss of calcium and potassium in the
urine. Calcium oxalate stone formation is also promoted in very acidic
urine. Free-choice feeding is best for a more constant urinary pH and
avoids the large increase in urine pH seen 3 to 6 hours after a large
meal is fed. Urine pH should be maintained between 6.2 and 6.5 in
mostcats.
 Nutritional Issues Unique fo fhe Cat
Cats have urique nutritional requirements that must be kept in
mind when developing diets for them. Dog foods are not appropriate

typically low in plant sources so it may be difficult to acquire sufficient
protein and amino acids. Taurine, which is required for cats, is not
a   ps aa rs sn p sd  
diet is fed. Carritine is not a required amino acid, but it may be essen-
tial for growth. Carritine is also not found in plant sources. Plant
sources are typically low in methiorine, lysine, and tryptophan, and
diets must be formulated to include sufficient quantities of these
amino acids. Glutamate is also found in high concentrations in plants,
and some cats carnot tolerate diets high in glutamate. Arachidonic
acid is an essential fatty acid for the cat, and it is found orly in meat
sources. If increased levels of omega-3 fatty acids are fed to cats, the
vitamin E content should also be increased to prevent steatitis. Cats
carnot utilize β-carotene, so vitamin A must be supplied in the diet.
Vitamin Bz2 is not found in plant sources and must be added to veg-
etarian diets. Niacin should also be added to a vegetarian diet because
the riacin present in plants is largely unavailable for absorption
Many owners will give cats milk to drink. With age, lactose activity
in the intestine decreases. Small amounts of milk may be tolerated by
many cats, but milk ingestion can lead to diarrhea or Gl discomfort.
Cats should not be fed onions, onion-based broth, or orior powder
Chemicals present in orions can oxidize hemoglobin in the cat, leading
to red blood cell destruction and anemia. Spoiled fish should not be
fed to cats. Histidine present in fish can convert to histamine with
spoilage, and histamine ingestion causes salivation, vomiting, and
diarrhea within 30 minutes. When fish is being fed to cats, it must be

probably normal, as dogs prefer the taste of certain chemicals that are
produced in decomposing food. Unfortunately, decomposing foods
can also contain a high number of bacteria, which is unhealthy if
ingested. Garbage ingestion can result in vomiting, diarrhea, abdomi-
nal pain, shock, or death. Access to garbage should be prevented.
Coprophagia is the ingestion of feces by pets. Sometimes pets will
ingest their own feces, but more commorly they will ingest the feces
of other arimals or species. This condition is common in dogs, but
quite uncommon in cats. Coprophagia is a normal behavior in dams,
who eat the feces of their young from birth to about 3 weeks of age.
It is their way of keeping the nest area clean, and in the wild, helped
to avoid attracting the attention of predators. Dogs in the wild may
have also consumed the feces of herbivores because it is rich in many
nutrients. Potential medical causes of coprophagia include intestinal
parasites, intestinal malabsorption, hyperthyroidism, Cushing's
disease, diabetes mellitus, or steroid admiristration. Complications
associated with coprophagia include gastroenteritis and diarrhea,

SECTION 1 NUTRITION AND DIETARY MANAGEMENT
especially if cow feces are being consumed. Reinfection with intestinal
parasites can also be a problem. The best treatment for coprophagia is
to avoid exposure to feces. There are commercial products that can be
added to the diet that are readily ingested but have an unpleasant taste
when excreted in the stool. Meat tenderizer or pancreatic enzymes
added to the diet may also be effective because these also cause feces
to have an unpleasant taste. However, these products must be added
to the diet of all dogs in the house. If the dog routinely eats feces, litter
boxes should be kept clean at all times to minimize exposure to feces
If the dog eats its own stool or that of another arimal, then it is best
to walk the dog on a leash to prevent access. If the dog has the habit
of eating its own feces, a food reward could be offered instead, before
it has had the opporturity to eat stool. This way the dog learns to
associate defecation with a treat.

CHAPTER6
Feeding the Puppy or Kitten
Nutrition of the Growing Puppy
■Nursing Period
Newborn puppies should be closely moritored for warmth and
weight gain. During the first few weeks of life, puppies do not have a
good ability to maintain their body temperature, and they have very
little body fat. Thus, the environmental temperature should be main-
         s
become cold, the dam may reject the puppy and not allow it to nurse.
Puppies should be weighed every day using an accurate gram scale.
During the first week of life, puppies should gain about 8% of their
about 6% of their current body weight per day, about 4% in the third
week, and about 3.5% in the fourth week. Small breeds reach about
50% of their adult weight by 4 months of age, and larger breeds reach
50% of their adult weight by about 5 months of age. Adequate weight
gain during the rursing period is a reflection of quality of milk, ade-
quate intake of milk, and health status. If milk intake is inadequate,
the puppy can easily develop a low glucose concentration. Puppies
have very little reserve of fat or glycogen, and if there is inadequate
milk intake, they are unable to maintain normal blood glucose con-
centrations. Puppies also can become dehydrated very rapidly
Dam's milk is very digestible and high in calories. It is also high in
protein, containing about twice as much protein as cow's milk.
Puppies increase their fat stores rapidly after birth, and the dam's
95

SECTION1NUTRITIONANDDIETARYMANAGEMENT
milk must contain adequate fat to support this. The fat content of
milk is dependent on the dietary fat content of the food consumed by
the dam, and it should be about 9% fat. Lactose is the primary carbo
 s       s n i  n 
to cow's milk. Lactose is easily absorbed after digestion. Colostrum is
very high in calcium, but the calcium content decreases in subsequent
milk. Milk is very low in iron, and puppies have a high iron require-
ment. Puppies can become iron deficient, especially if they are
infected with fleas or have intestinal hookworms. Puppies should
start to consume food at about 3 weeks of age to provide supplemen-
tal iron. For weaning, a diet designed for growth can be mixed with
warm water and ground into gruel. The diet for weaning puppies
should be highly digestible, and as intake increases, the amount of
water can be decreased.

of calories for growth. When puppies reach about 80% of their adult
weight, orly about 8%-10% of calories are used for growth. Thus, the
energy requirement is highest in the youngest puppies and decreases
can be found in Chapter 4.
 Body condition should be closely moritored in growing puppies. If
energy intake is excessive, puppies can become overweight or obese,
and this increased weight can contribute to skeletal problems.
Maintenance of lean body condition does not decrease adult size and
appears to increase longevity.
Protein
Protein requirements are highest in the youngest puppies and
decrease with age. Arginine is an essential amino acid in puppies.
but the arginine requirement decreases with age. Previously, it was
thought that high-protein diets contributed to skeletal problems in
giant-breed dogs. However, it has been shown that diets containing
higher levels of protein (up to 32% DM) do not cause skeletal prob-
lems as long as the calcium and phosphorus content of the diet
is adequate. Recommended protein content in diets is 22%-32%
DM for dogs with an adult body weight less than 55lb and 20%-
32% DM for dogs with an adult body weight greater than 55lb
(Table 6.1).

Carbohydrate
 Puppies should be fed about 20% DM carbohydrate until at least 4

 Growing puppies require about 250mg/kg body weight of linoleic

body weight greater than 55lb, the dietary fat content should be 8%-
diet. Excessive fat can affect bone formation in large-breed and giant-
  -  si      s 
breed dogs should be carefully controlled to avoid excessive energy
intake.
Minerals
Calcium and phosphorus are critical minerals for the growing
puppy. Calcium absorption in the intestine is high when the puppies
are between 2 and 6 months of age, and overall there is less control of
calcium homeostasis at this age. Even when the calcium content of the
calcium absorption remains at about 40%. After about 10 months of
age, calcium homeostasis becomes better regulated, and puppies
become less sensitive to an excess of dietary calcium. For large- and
giant-breed puppies, the diet should contain 0.7%-1.2% DM calcium.
For small- to medium-breed puppies, the diet can contain 0.7%-1.7%
DM calcium.

Nutrition of the Growing Kitten
 Nursing Period
Newborn kittens should be closely moritored for warmth and
weight gain. As in newborn puppies, newborn kittens poorly regulate
 s        q 
be weighed at birth and then at least weekly. The average kitten birth
weight is about 100g, and kittens should gain about 100g/week for
the first 6 months of life. Poor weight gain or a weight loss suggests
inadequate milk production by the queen, inadequate milk intake by
the kitten (inability to suckle), or illness of the kitten or queer.
The energy content of colostrum is very high on day 1 of production
and decreases by day 3. The energy of queen's milk then increases
throughout lactation. The calcium and phosphorus concentration of
milk increases through day 14 of lactation, and iron, copper, and mag-
nesium concentrations decrease during this period. Taurine is impor
tant for normal development, and queen's milk is rich in taurine. Cow
and goat milk are low in taurine ard are rot acceptable replacements
for queen's milk. Lactose is the primary carbohydrate in queen's milk,
but the concentration is lower than in cow's milk. The nutrient com-
position of queen's milk is ideal for growth, and milk from other
species does not provide the same nutriert levels. If milk production
is inadequate, a milk replacer especially formulated for kittens should
be fed.
■Postweaning Period
Energy
Kittens have a high energy requirement due to their rapid growth
rate. Diets should be high in energy so that small amounts of food will
meet the energy needs. The daily energy requirement decreases until
about 10 months of age. Neutering at any age decreases the energy
requirement by about 30%. Kittens should be monitored for the devel-
opment of obesity, especially those that have been neutered. Energy
requirements for growing kittens can be found in Chapter 4.
Protein
The protein requirement of kittens is high and declines gradually

CHAPTER 7
Feeding the Pregnant or
Lactating
 Dog or Cat
The goal of proper nutrition during gestation and lactation is to
produce an optimal number of healthy puppies or kittens. For optimal
reproduction, proper nutrition should begin during the growth phase
of the dam or queen, while they are young, and should continue
during adulthood, breeding, gestation, and lactation.
The Impact of Improperly Formulated Diets
Special care needs to be taken to ensure that the diet of the pregnant
dog or cat is properly balanced and meets energy needs. Diets defi-
cient in protein can result in low birth weights and increased illness
Or death of newborns. Carbohydrate-free diets are associated with low
birth weights, increased stillbirths, and increased illness of newborns.
Carbohydrate-free diets may also predispose the bitch to periparturi-
ent hypoglycemia. Deficiency of dietary zinc can result in fatal resorp-
tion and small litter size. Deficiencies in iron, pyridoxine, or biotin can
lead to decreased immurity of the puppies. Excess dietary vitamin A
can result in small litters and congerital abnormalities. Excess dietary
vitamin D can lead to calcification of soft tissues.
Prior to Breeding
Breeding animals should be chosen based on their conformation, tem-
peramert, and overall health. All breeding arimals should be screened
103
104
SECTION1NUTRITIONANDDIETARYMANAGEMENT
for any genetic abnormalities. In addition, a thorough physical exam
should be performed just prior to breeding and should include a check
for fecal parasites and serum testing for brucellosis.
The dam or queen should be at a good body weight prior to breed-
ing and should not be underweight or overweight (body condition
  aus 'mn si n n    ( ro ino   a
be able to consume erough calories during gestation to meet her nutri-
tional needs, which can impact conception, litter size, and puppy or
kitten viability. Obese arimals may have smaller litters, a decreased
 o  a d o     
may also have irregular heat cycles, which makes conception more
difficult, and can have a higher incidence of difficult delivery.
During estrus, there are no special nutritional requirements other
than that for adult mainterance. Some bitches may decrease their food
intake during estrus, with the lowest intake at the time of ovulation.
The short-term decrease in caloric intake does not appear to have an
impact on fertility or litter size, but it may be helpful to feed multiple
small meals to promote intake.
Gestation in Dogs
In dogs gestation averages 63 days. Prior to whelping, bitches gain
about 15%-25% of their prebreeding body weight; after whelping.
dams should weigh about 5%-10% more than their prebreeding
weight.
Fetal growth is very slow during the first 40 days of pregnancy,
with orly 5.5% of fetal mass developed by day 40. No increase in food

rapid fetal growth phase, the energy requirement in bitches is about
30% higher than during maintenance; if the bitch is carrying a large
litter, the energy required may be up to 60% higher than during pre-
breeding. Urfortunately, during the last week of pregnancy when the
energy requirement is highest, food intake is somewhat limited by the
space-occupying uterus and fetuses. Large breeds carrying large litters

Homemade diets for late gestation should provide about 20%-25%
protein on a dry matter (DM) basis, with about 4kcal metabolizable
energy (ME)/g DM (or about 4g of protein per 100kcal ME). Tc
obtain a diet with a density of 4kcal/g, 10%-25% fat is typically pro-
vided in the diet. Bitches also have a high requirement for glucose
during the last weeks of gestatior; about 20% energy from carbohy-
drate is sufficient. Calcium and phosphorus requirements increase
by about 60% during the last month of gestation due to the rapid
growth of fetuses. Excess calcium should be avoided though, and
diets should provide a calcium-to-phosphorus ratio of 1:1-1.5:1
(Table 7.1).

In cats gestation usually lasts 63-65 days. The pattern of weight gain

weight during the second week of pregnancy. This early weight gain.
is not associated with fetal growth, but rather is stored energy for
lactation. After giving birth, the queen will orly lose about 40% of the
weight that was gained during pregnancy. The 60% of weight gained
during pregnancy that is not lost will be used to support milk produc-
tion. Queens need to be in good body condition at the time of mating
and during pregnancy. Underweight queens have an increased inci-
dence of conception failure, fetal malformations or death, and under
weight kittens. In addition they may be unable to support adequate
milk production. Obesity also leads to reproductive problems, with an
increase in stillbirths and dystocia; thus, it is recommended that the
queen be in ideal body condition at the time of mating.

Energy requirements increase throughout gestation in the cat. Food
intake in the queen may actually decrease about 2 weeks after mating
when fetal implantation occurs. Food intake may also decrease in the
last week of gestation. The energy needed during gestation is about
25%-50% greater (approximately 90-110kcal/kg BW /day) than that
by foods containing 35%-50% protein, 18%-35% fat, and 10% carbo-
hydrate (Table 7.2). Free-choice feeding of an energy-dense food is
recommended during gestation to ensure adequate energy intake.
Copper deficiency during gestation can lead to fetal death, abor-
tions, and deformities. Copper should be present in the diet at 15mg/
kg food DM and should come from a digestible source. Foods for the
reproducing cat should also produce a urinary pH between 6.2 and
6.5 to prevent metabolic acidosis, which can lead to poor bone devel-
opment in kitters.
Lactation in the Dog
Lactation requires a considerable amount of energy, more than during
any other life stage. The amount of milk produced by the dam equates
to the dairy cow; dogs in peak lactation can produce an average of
greater than 8% of their body weight in milk per day For example, a
German Shepherd dam may produce 1700mL milk/day during peak
lactation, as compared to the average human producing 750mL/day
Dam's milk contains twice the protein and fat as compared to cow's
milk due to the rapid rate of growth of puppies compared to
calories.
CHAPTER 7 FEEDING THE PREGNANT OR LACTATING DOG OR CAT107
Water intake is very important for milk production; a large dog may
drink 5-6 liters of water per day during peak lactation. Fresh, clean
water should be available at all times during lactation.
The energy requirement increases after whelping and reaches a
peak between 3 and 5 weeks at approximately two to four times that
of maintenance requiremerts. The limiting factor for energy intake is
typically the energy density of the food; if the diet provided is low in
calories to meet the puppies' energy needs. Thus, it is recommended
to feed a diet during lactation that is highly digestible and high in
energy density. Free-choice feeding is the best option for the lactating
dam. The stress of caring for puppies increases the energy require-
ment, but most energy is used for milk production. Approximately
180 kcalis used to produce 100g of milk. The amount of milk produced
is dependent on the number and size of the puppies; the greatest
quantity of milk is produced during midlactation when puppies are
pooy pos Aue bugea jaA jou are inq Sumoa Aipidei
The protein requirement increases greatly during lactation. Dams
require about 6g digestible protein/100kcal ME, which corresponds
to about 19%-27% protein in a diet. In a homemade diet, the protein
o p ng an s so/od o re pn st a
the diet will greatly increase the energy in the diet. A diet between
12% and 20% fat can increase the fat calories for the puppies. It may
be beneficial to increase the long-chain omega-3 fatty acid content in
the diet of dams to increase the omega-3 fatty acid content in the milk.
Puppies require docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; a long-chain omega-3
fatty acid) for proper retinal and nervous system development, and
this is obtained through milk. Carbohydrates in the diet should provide
10%-20% of the energy. Calcium and phosphorus requirements also
increase during lactation, but the calcium-to-phosphorus ratio should
be maintained at 1.3:1 in the diet. During peak lactation, dams require
about two to five times more calcium than during maintenance. Diets
for lactation should contain 0.8%-1.1% calcium and 0.6%-0.8%
phosphorus.

feeding is recommended. The protein requirement also greatly
increases during lactation to provide essential amino acids. A queen
with a large litter may lose 19g protein/day in the milk. Protein levels
at 30%-35% are recommended to meet protein needs. Arimal-based
protein sources are preferred because they are more digestible and
provide better amino acid profiles as compared to vegetable sources
of protein. The taurine requirement during lactation is similar to that
during maintenance, so a specific increase in taurine is not necessary
during lactation.
 Fat is an important source of calories because it provides more calo-
ries than does protein or carbohydrate. The diet should provide
a higher fat content in the diet increases the number of kittens per
litter, decreases kitten mortality, and improves reproductive efficiency
of the queen. Linoleic, linoleric, and arachidoric acid are required
fatty acids for the cat and must be provided in the diet. Dietary defi
ciencies of linoleic and arachidoric acid can result in reproductive
failure in which queens do not bear live kittens. Male cats, however,
can maintain spermatogenesis even on an arachidonic acid-deficient
system development, as it is in puppies. Thus, it is beneficial to add
long-chain omega-3 fatty acids to the diet of the lactating queen.
        
should be included at about 10% DM in the diet.
Calcium and phosphorus requirements also increase during lacta-
tion, but the calcium-to-phosphorus ratio should be maintained at
1:1-1.5:1. The recommended dietary level of calcium is 1.0%-1.6%
DM in the diet. Magnesium should not be restricted during lactation,
and levels of 0.08%-0.15% DM are recommended in the diet.
Weaning Puppies
Weaning begins as puppies start eating some solid food, usually
between 3 and 4 weeks of age. As puppies start consuming more and
more solid food, there is less nursing. which decreases the amount of
milk produced. However, some dams continue to produce a large
quantity of milk, which increases the risk for mastitis. Food intake
should be restricted for a few days prior to wearing to decrease nutri-
ents available for milk production. This will decrease the amount of

Disorders Occurring during Gestation/Lactation
Eclampsia (Puerperal Tetany)
Dams are most likely to develop eclampsia at the point of peak
lactation (about 3-4 weeks postparturition). At this time, there is a
tremendous amount of calcium lost in the milk. Eclampsia is usually
large loss of calcium in the milk, the serum concentration of calcium
decreases, causing hypocalcemia. Signs of hypocalcemia include a stiff
gait, restlessness, agitation, uncoordination, muscular tremors, and
seizures; death can occur if the low calcium level is not treated. If
usually entails intravenous administration of solutions containing
calcium. Since this condition usually occurs just prior to wearing.
puppies are separated from the dam and are typically weaned at this
time. Occasionally, eclampsia will occur during whelping: this is
usually due to excessive panting during a difficult whelping, which
can alter the serum pH and cause hypocalcemia. Cats more commorly
exhibit signs of eclampsia during the last 3 weeks of pregnancy. Signs
include weakness, muscle tremors, anorexia, vomiting, flaccid paraly
sis, and malaise.
Prevention of eclampsia involves feeding adequate amounts of a
properly balanced diet during pregnancy and lactation. The dietary
calcium-to-phosphorus ratio should be maintained close to 1:1. Some
breeders will supplement with additional calcium during pregnancy
to prevent this problem, but this is not recommended and can actually
potentiate the occurrence of eclampsia.

 Periparturient Hypoglycemia
Periparturient hypoglycemia (low concentration of glucose in the
serum) occurs infrequently in bitches, but it can occur during the last
few weeks of gestation. Clinical signs may appear to be similar to those
of eclampsia and include nervousness, twitching. and seizures.
Hypoglycemia usually occurs in bitches that are in poor body condi-

Feeding the Senior Pet
Better health care, nutrition, and genetic background of pets have
contributed to an increasing life span in both dogs and cats. Greater
than 40% of dogs and 30% of cats in the Urited States are 6 years of
age, and more than 30% of those are over 1l years of age. The goals
of nutrition in the serior pet are to minimize the signs of aging, slow
metabolic processes associated with aging, enhance the quality of life,
and increase life span, if possible. Older pets can have a large variation
in health status, so it is important to evaluate each pet on an individual
basis.
The Senior Dog
Dogs of different breeds mature at different rates. The overall average
life span is about 13 years, but small breeds of dogs can live signifi-

sidered to be senior at different ages based on size. Small to medium
dogs weighing less than 50lb are considered to be serior at 11-15 years
of age; those 50-90lb are serior at about 9 years of age, and very large
dogs greater than 90lb are serior at about 7.5 years of age.
Older dogs can suffer from a rumber of health problems. The
leading causes of death in the older dog are cancer, kidney disease,
and heart disease, and all older pets should be routinely screened for
these disorders.
113
114 SECTION 1 NUTRITION ANDDIETARY MANAGEMENT
Nutritional Needs of the Senior Dog
Because of the incidence of decreased kidney function, a fresh, clean
source of water should be available at all times. Water intake should
be monitored to identify increases in intake, which could be an early
indication of changes in renal function or the presence of other
disorders.
The resting metabolic rate gradually slows with age. This decrease
is due to a loss of lean body tissue and an increase in body fat. By the
age of 7 years, there is an approximate 13% decrease in the daily
e     s s    s
gain in the serior pet. As dogs get very old, however, they may
become underweight due to decreasing food intake. The very old
dog may benefit from being fed a highly digestible, energy-dense
diet.
Senior dogs have a tendency to become overweight, so the fat
content of the diet should be adequate but not excessive. For very old
dogs that lose weight due to decreased food intake, increasing the fat

intake. Increased fat content also increases the energy density of the
diet so less needs to be consumed to meet energy needs. Fat contents
in diets for senior dogs will vary from 7% to 15%, depending on body
condition (Table 8.1).
The protein requirement for older dogs is debated. Due to the
decrease in lean body mass and decrease in protein synthesis, the
recommended level of protein in the diet may be higher than that for

 gested to decrease the level of dietary protein in sernior dogs to prevent
the occurrence of kidney disease. However, it has been shown that a
higher protein intake does not contribute to the occurrence of kidney

disease in healthy dogs. Once kidney disease is present, it then may
be beneficial to decrease dietary protein.
Excessive phosphorus in diets should be avoided because of the
increased incidence of renal disease. For serior dogs, diets providing
0.25%-0.75% DM phosphorus are recommended. The calcium-to-
phosphorus ratio should be maintained, and diets should provide
0.5%-1.0% DM calcium. Osteoporosis is not a problem in older dogs
as it is in people, and thus excess calcium supplementation is not
required or recommended.
Sodium and chloride do not necessarily need to be restricted in the
healthy senior dog, but there is no reason to feed excessive levels
either. Diets for senior dogs should provide 0.2%-0.35% DM sodium.
The Senior Cat
Cats are considered serior at about 7 years of age, and geriatric at
about 12 years of age. As in dogs, the older cat is more susceptible to
a variety of diseases. Serior cats are less active and have a decreased
basal metabolic rate due to a decrease in lean body mass. They are also
less adaptable, and are not able to withstand changes in their environ-
ment and diet as well as do younger cats. Older cats may have
decreased senses of smell or taste, and diets should be highly palatable
to avoid a reduction in food intake.
 Nutritional Needs of the Senior Cat
The rutrient requirements of older cats are similar to those of young
 to middle-aged cats. Dehydration is a commor problem in older cats
 as thirst sensitivity decreases with aging. Clean, fresh water should be
available at all times, and water intake should be about 200-250mL/
day.
Even though energy needs decrease in the older cat, the prevalence
of obesity decreases after 7 years of age, and the prevalence of under
weight cats increases after ll years of age. Old cats can become under-
weight due to concurrent disease, decreases in appetite or sensory
function, and decreased digestion and absorption of food. Decreased
pancreatic enzyme secretion reduces fat digestion in older cats, and
changes in liver function can affect nutrient absorption. Thus, older
cats need to be moritored closely to maintain an optimal body condi
tion. Diets for the very old cat should be highly digestible and energy-
dense to promote caloric intake.

Protein intake should rot be restricted in the older cat. In elderly
humans, the protein requirement is increased by 25% over that of
adult maintenance. A benefit of increasing the protein content of diets
is an increase in palatability, which promotes food intake. An optimal
range of protein for the older cat has not been determined; dietary
protein between 30% and 45% DM are recommended for healthy older
cats (Table 8.2).
Obesity should be avoided in the older cat as diseases associated
with obesity (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and heart disease) are
common. However, older cats have a high requirement for the essen-
tial fatty acids (linoleic, linolenic, and arachidoric acid) to maintain
skin and coat condition. Fat digestion decreases with age, so dietary
fat should not be restricted urless the cat is obese. Dietary fat content
should be 10%-25% DM for older cats.
    5  1   n   
dietary fiber is important because constipation is a common problem
in older cats, and fiber promotes intestinal motility. High-fiber diets
are not recommended for older cats as they decrease the energy density
of the diet and decrease digestibility.
Reduced dietary phosphorus is usually recommended for older cats
due to the incidence of kidney disease. Diets providing 0.5%-0.7% DM
phosphorus are adequate. As in dogs, osteoporosis is not a common
problem in old cats, although there may be some decrease in bone
mass due to the decrease in lean body mass. Dietary calcium should
be provided at 0.6%-1.0% DM.
Potassium may be required at a slightly higher level in the older cat
due to loss of potassium in the urine, decreased intake of food, and
increased intestinal loss. Decreased potassium levels may lead to leth-
 d  r sd  ss   s
0.6%-1.0% DM. Older cats may also have increased loss of magne-
sium, and severe dietary magnesium restriction should be avoided.
CHAPTER 8 FEEDING THE SENIOR PET117
 Dietary magnesium should be provided at 0.05%-0.1% DM. Excessive
dietary sodium should be avoided in older cats due to the increased
incidence of hypertension, renal disease, hyperthyroidism, and heart
disease. Sodium intake, however, must be adequate to maintain acid-
base status. Dietary sodium should be provided at 0.2%-0.6% DM, and
chloride levels are typically 1.5 times the sodium concentration.
The pH of the urine is important in older cats as kidney disease is
more prevalent. Diets that produce a highly acidic urine should not
be fed to older cats due to the increased systemic acidic load and the
 potential for metabolic acidosis. Urinary pH values in older cats should
be maintained between 6.2 and 6.5.

 Nutrition is also important. By matching proper nutrients to the level
and type of exercise, performance can be enhanced.
Exercise Physiology
Exercise requires changes in metabolic processes and in a number of
organ systems. Muscular physiology is most impacted by training and

"slow twitch" and have a high oxidative capacity and endurance. Type
dogs have a higher proportion of type 2 fibers, and those performing
in endurance events have a higher proportion of type 1 fibers. With
intermediate types of exercise, there is a higher proportion of type 1
fibers as well, since the exercise more closely resembles that of endur
ance everts, orly shorter in duration.
Energy used for muscle contraction is stored as ATP (adenosine
triphosphate), and the amount used is proportional to the amount of

work done. ATP is also used for maintenance of the electrolyte con-
centration gradient across membranes. The amount of ATP stored in
muscle is low, so it must be replerished rapidly during exercise.
for energy. Glucose stored as muscle glycogen can also regenerate
ATP via anaerobic and aerobic pathways. Anaerobic metabolism is
rapid, but generates little ATP, whereas aerobic metabolism is slower,
but can generate a much higher amount of ATP. Fatty acids are plenti-
ful in adipose tissue and in muscle and serve as the primary energy
source for longer-duration exercise. Amino acids do not serve as a

used during exercise.
The major by-product of muscle contraction is heat, which must be
through evaporation. Therefore, an adequate supply of water must be
maintained to prevent dehydration due to water loss from the respira-
tory tract. Lactic acid and carbon dioxide are also produced by anaero
bic metabolism and can increase the pH, thereby decreasing muscle
performance. Carbon dioxide can be eliminated by the respiratory
tract or by renal excretion of bicarbonate. Lactate can be used for
energy or converted back to glucose.
Metabolism in general increases during exercise, and muscle
metabolism can increase more than 20-fold. Cardiac output increases
with exercise, along with stroke volume and heart rate. Circulating
blood is important for removal of carbon dioxide from muscle and
for transporting oxygen to muscle. The number of blood cells
increases during exercise due to contraction of the spleen, and
plasma volume decreases. Urine output decreases to conserve plasma
volume, and more concentrated urine is produced. It is important to
maintain adequate hydration during exercise to help maintain
plasma volume.
Nutrition of thePerformance Dog
■Energy
The energy required increases with exercise and is dependent upon
its type and duration. For long-duration exercise, fat is primarily used
for energy; sprinting types of exercise use primarily carbohydrates.

normal dog. Thus, diets formulated for sprinting dogs are Figher in

requirements during exercise can be found in Chapter 4.
Protein
Protein is not usually used for energy during exercise; carbohydrate
and fat sources are preferred fuels. However, protein is used as an
energy source when the intensity and duration of exercise exceeds the
level of conditioning of the animal. This can happen early in the train-
ing period or during performance events. Carbohydrate stores become
depleted, and there is a shift to the use of branded-chain amino acids
branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) are all
essential amino acids because they carnot be adequately synthesized
from other amino acids. Thus, when protein is used for energy, the
essential amino acids must be replaced by the diet. Using protein for

Diets for the performance dog should contain adequate high-
quality protein, but the protein level should not be excessive. When
excess proteins are ingested, amino acid breakdown increases because
they are not stored. This increase in breakdown produces ketoacids,
and the urea produced is excreted in the urine with a loss of body
water.

weeks prior to working. At this time, a highly digestible, moderate-
carbohydrate, moderate-protein, and moderate- to high-fat diet should
be fed. While working. the energy requirements may be two to five
times the resting energy required, depending on the duration, fre-

exercise or more than 4 hours prior to exercise. A small amount of
food should be given either during exercise or at the end of breaks,
less than 15 minutes before returning to exercise. There should be free
access to water, and hydration status should be monitored
frequently.
Dogs participating in endurance events can have very high energy
requirements, from 5 to 11 times the resting energy normally required.
Thus, a very energy-dense diet should be fed to meet the caloric needs.

 Carbohydrate
such as racing greyhounds. Energy must be quickly metabolized to
run a race, and greyhounds rapidly use muscle glycogen as a source
of energy. This ratio of energy production depends upon the amount
of glycogen in muscle, and muscle glycogen can be altered by diet and
trairing. Diets high in carbohydrates should provide about 50%-70%
of the total calories in the diet to maximize glycogen stores in muscle.
 Moderate amounts of carbohydrate should be given to sprinting dogs
within 30 minutes after exercise to allow rapid repletion of glycogen.
A glucose solution is usually given during this period.
For intermediate levels of exercise, the optimal amount of dietary
carbohydrates is quite variable. If a dog is performing high-intensity
work in short bursts, ther carbohydrates should provide up to 50% of
the dietary calories. Dogs performing longer periods of moderate-
ries from carbohydrates.
Dogs participating in endurance events require very little carbohy-
drate in the diet. Diets for endurance dogs should provide less than
15% of calories from carbohydrate. Small amounts of carbohydrate
need to be provided to maintain good stool quality and avoid
diarrhea.
Ingredients providing carbohydrates should be Highly digestible tc

the colon increase fecal water loss, and "stress" diarrhea can occur.
Increased stool volume also results in extra weight, which can hinder

■Fat
therefore is important in increasing the energy density of the diet.
Increasing the fat content helps to increase palatability, which is also
important for the performance dog. Hard-working dogs may require
       s     
cases, sled dogs may require as many as 10,0o0kcal per day. Diets
designed for these dogs must be highly digestible, be highly palatable,
and contain high amounts of fat. Even with intermediate exercise,
increased dietary fat provides increased dietary energy.
High levels of dietary fat can increase endurance. In trained ath-
letes, free fatty acid (FFA) oxidation provides an increased amount of
energy When dogs are fed high-fat diets, FFA concentrations are
increased and thus are more available for oxidation and energy pro
duction. Insulin concentrations are also lower in dogs fed high-fat
diets, which decreases FFA release from adipose tissue. Performance
dogs fed high-fat diets have better endurance. High-fat diets can be
tolerated if they are introduced gradually.

be fed. Unsaturated fatty acids are important for membrane fluidity
and are required for hormone synthesis and the integrity of the skin.

tion of membranes, which can damage cell membranes. If a high
concentration of unsaturated fatty acids is fed, then an increased level
of vitamin E should be provided as an antioxidant. Medium-chain
triglyceride  (MCT)  supplementation may enhance  performance
because it may increase the rate of FFA oxidation. MCTs are not very
palatable, and further research is needed to evaluate the affect of MCT
on performance.
For sprinting dogs, fat content should be 8%-10% DM or should
provide 20%-24% of dietary calories. For intermediate-level work,
dietary fat content depends on the intensity and duration of work.
Dogs in the off-season should be fed as a normal adult dog, but
fat content should increase as work increases. With moderate work,
fat should provide 15%-30% DM, or 30%-55% of total dietary calo
ries. With more strenuous work, 25%-40% DM, or 45%-65% of total
calories, should be provided by dietary fat. Endurance athletes
should be fed a level of fat greater than 50% DM, or 75% of total
calories.
CHAPTER 9 FEEDING THE PERFORMANCE DOG125
■Water
Water is the most importart of all rutrients. About 64% of body
water is located in cells and 7% in the plasma. Water balance is
increased by water intake and water production during metabolism
and decreased by water loss in urine, feces, and sweat. During exer

climates, there is a decrease in total body water due to heat dissipation,
primarily through evaporation in the respiratory tract. This loss of
body water can lead to dehydration, which has a sigrificant impact
on performance and endurance. Under most circumstances, the per-
formance dog loses more water than electrolytes, which decreases
plasma volume. To prevent dehydration, fresh, clean water should be
available at all times; if this is not possible, water should be offered at
 n        s  
intake.
Vitamins and Minerals
The requirement for some vitamins and minerals increase with
exercise. B-complex vitamins and vitamin C requirements increase
because they are used as cofactors for erzymes and for collager syn-
thesis. There may also be an increased loss of water-soluble vitamins
due to loss of body water. Even though there is no concrete evidence
showing the necessity for increase in water-soluble vitamins during
exercise, it is generally safe to supplement these vitamins because
excesses are typically excreted in urine. Fat-soluble vitamins, espe-
cially vitamins A and D, on the other hand, should not be supple
mented, since excesses of these vitamins are stored in fat and can lead
to toxicity. However, supplementation with vitamin E may be benefi
cial as an antioxidant, especially when diets high in polyunsaturated
fatty acids are fed.
The calcium/phosphorus ratio is important in diets for the perfor-
ible calcium. Dietary calcium should be 1.2%-2.0% of the diet. Excess
calcium should be avoided since this can inhibit the absorption of zinc.
Magnesium should also be fed at 0.12% of the diet.
Sodium may also be lost via saliva in exercising dogs, especially in
hot and humid climates. The loss of sodium should stimulate thirst

and cause conservation of water by the kidneys. Electrolyte solutions
may be popular, but there is debate as to their usefulness. Some elec-
trolyte solutions may actually lead to Gl discomfort, diarrhea, and
further dehydration.
Feeding Strategies—When to Feed
Diets need to be fed at a time that allows maximal absorption to
occur, yet doesn't interfere with performance. Dogs should be fed
more than 4 hours prior to exercise. Dogs fed closer to exercise have
a higher body temperature during exercise, which is caused by heat
released by digesfion. This decreases circulafion to the skin and can

of exercise also use more glucose and less fat. The insulin release
caused by a meal decreases the use of fat and promotes carbohydrate
use, leading to depletion of glycogen stores. When food is given
more than 4 hours before exercise, emptying of the bowel is also pro
moted. This helps prevent the development of stress-induced
diarrhea.
Feeding should also occur within 2 hours after exercise. Glycogen
synthesis is more rapid in the immediate postexercise period. Feeding
those undergoing strenuous exercise on consecutive days.
Poorly conditioned hunting dogs can experience "hunting dog
hypoglycemia." In this condition, dogs begin working normally, but
become weak and have tremors that can progress to injuries or death.
Feeding more than 4 hours prior to the start of hunting helps to lower
the insulin level by the time exercise starts. Feeding a small amount
of food during exercise may also help to better maintain glucose
homeostasis in these dogs.
When switching to a diet designed for performance, it can take 6
weeks of feeding to maximize the effects of these diets. Changes in
muscle and oxidative capacity take time; training and the change to a
performance diet should occur 6 weeks before the exercise event.

then feed as an adult dog. Training should start approximately 6
weeks prior to working. At this time, a highly digestible, moderate-
carbohydrate, moderate-protein, and moderate- to high-fat diet should
be fed. While working, the energy requirements may be two to five
times the resting energy required, depending on the duration, fre-
quency, and intensity of the work. Feeding should ocur either after
exercise or more than 4 hours prior to exercise. A small amount of

CHAPTER1O
Food Intolerance and Allergy
An abnormal response to an ingested food is termed an adverse reaction
to food. Adverse reactions to food can have an immunological or a
norimmunological cause. Immunological causes of adverse reactions
include food anaphylaxis and food allergy. Norimmunological causes
include dietary indiscretion and food intolerance (metabolic food reac-
tion, food poisoning, food idiosyncrasy, pharmacological reaction to
food).
The incidence of adverse reactions to food is urknown but probably
 accounts for about 62% of allskin diseases seen in a general veterinary
practice. Approximately 23% of all dogs with allergic skin disease are
actually allergic to some ingredient in the diet. About 25% of those
dogs are also allergic to substances other than food, such as ragweed
or fleas. Adverse food reactions appear to be more common in cats,
 and food allergy is the third most common allergic skin disease in dogs
and cats after flea hypersensitivity and atopy.
Clinical Signs of Food Allergy
Food allergy may occur at any age, but most cases occur after the pet
has been exposed to the particular food for 2 or more years. It is not
uncommon for a pet to sudderly become allergic to the food it has
been eating routinely for several years. Up to one third of food allergy
cases may occur in dogs under 1 year of age. Dog breeds that appear
to be at increased risk for development of food allergy include cocker
spariels, springer spariels, Labrador retrievers, golden retrievers,

collies, miriature schnauzers, Chinese Shar-Pei, West Highland white
terriers, soft-coated wheaten terriers, boxers, dachshunds, Dalmafians,
Lhasa apsos, and German shepherd dogs.
Dogs with food allergies can start showing clirical signs at any time
of year, and it is usually a constant problem. However, food allergy

be accomparied by gastrointestinal (Gl) signs. Signs of itchy skin will
appear within several hours after eating the offending food. Dogs fed
in the morring may tend to scratch more in the afternoon or early
evering. Dogs fed in the early evering may scratch all right. Pruritus
is most common on the feet, face, armpits, inguinal region, rump, and
ears.
 Food anaphylaxis is an acute reaction to ingestion of food. Swelling
of the lips, face, eyelids, ears, conjunctiva, and tongue occurs (angio
edema) and may or may not be pruritic. Hives can also occur within
minutes of food ingestion.
Cats usually develop food allergies by 2 years of age, although
risk. Pruritus is most common, although up to 33% of cats with food
allergy have angioedema. Lymph nodes are erlarged in about 33% of
S          
seen in 20%-50% of feline cases.
Chinese Shar-Peis and German shepherd dogs are at increased risk
for the development of Gl signs with food allergy. Food allergy can
affect all segments of the Gl tract, including the stomach, small intes-
tine, and large intestine. Vomiting and diarrhea are common, and the
diarrhea may be profuse and watery, mucoid, or bloody. Abdominal
pain may also be present. About 15% of dogs and cats with skin signs
also have Gl signs. Irflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may in part be
associated with food allergy. Inflammation of the intestinal mucosa
may predispose the pet to development of food allergy.
Causes of Food Allergy
The Gl tract of the dog and cat is essentially a large tube lined with
cells that control the absorption of rutrients from food. These cells also
protect the body against injury from a number of harmful substances.
This defense system includes an effective mucosal barrier and the
immune system of the gut-associated lymphoid fissue (GALl). The

and control the absorption of antigens that can stimulate antibody
production.
In the normal dog, the ingestion of a particular food causes a very

controlled by other cells of the immune system. However, in the aller

of produced IgE, and clinical signs of food allergy occur. The amount
of IgE produced depends on a number of factors, including the genetic

exposed to the offending food. The large quantity of IgE produced
stimulates the breakdown of mast cells, which are present in the skin
and gut. These mast cells release a rumber of irritating substances that
can cause itchy skin and diarrhea.
Food Allergens
Almost any diet ingredient can cause an allergic response. The most
and 60,000 daltons. In dogs, allergies to beef, dairy products, or fish
account for about 89% of food allergies.
 Gluten (Gliadin) Enteropathy
Gluten intolerance affects Irish setters and possibly other breeds of
dogs. Cereal grains contain some proteins; in wheat, two of these
proteins are gliadin and gluterin. Gluten is a mixture of gliadin and
gluterin. Normally, pancreatic enzymes digest gluten, rendering it

activated by gliadin and cause a delayed hypersensitivity reaction.
Food Intolerance
Food intolerance includes food poisoring, reactions to vasoactive
amines, and carbohydrate intolerance. Food poisoning and reactions
to vasoactive amines such as histamine have been discussed in
Chapter 2.
132
SECTION1NUTRITIONANDDIETARYMANAGEMENT
Carbohydrate intolerance is typically due to lactose intolerance.
When pets with lactose intolerance consume milk products, diarrhea,
bloating, and abdominal discomfort can occur. Puppies and kittens
usually have adequate levels of intestinal lactose so that lactose can be
lactose may not be able to be digested. Goat and cow milk contain a
much higher level of lactose than does milk from dams or queens, thus
puppies fed cow or goat milk can also exhibit diarrhea due to the
excess lactose that carnot be digested. There are most likely a small
number of puppies and kittens that are born with metabolic defects in
lactose digestion. These puppies and kittens have diarrhea during the
neonatal period and typically fail to survive.
Some pets may be intolerant of disaccharides, especially secondary
to enteritis. With enteritis, the intestinal brush border is altered, and
loss ofdisaccharidase activity contributes tothe diarrhea. Disaccharidase
activity can take several days to increase after a change in ingested
carbohydrate. Thus, pets can have acute diarrhea for several days if a
rapid change to a high-carbohydrate diet is made.
Dietary Modification in Food Allergy
To determine the offending allergen, elimination trials are conducted.
An elimination diet should include orly one or two sources of novel
proteins and should be nutritionally balanced and complete. Excess
ible. Digestibility is important as complete digestion of a protein
results in amino acids that are poor antigens. The protein sources
should be proteins to which the pet has not previously been exposed.
Ingredients typically recommended for homemade dog foods include
lamb, rice, potato, fish, rabbit, verison, or tofu. Ingredients recom-
mended for cats include lamb, rice, rabbit, or venison.
Prior to starting an elimination trial, the pet should be fed the usual
diet for 7-14 days, during which time a record should be kept detailing
all foods and treats fed and the occurrence of adverse reactions. Then
the elimination diet is fed for 4-12 weeks. During this time, no other
foods or treats should be fed. If clinical signs of skin allergy decrease,
then a diagnosis of food allergy is made. At this time, single ingredi-
ents fed previously can be reintroduced into the diet to see whether
clinical signs of allergy recur. In cases where Gl signs are the predomi-
nant allergic signs, an elimination diet can be fed for a shorter period
of time (2-4 weeks)

macrophages, and these substances are very strong inflammatory
mediators. Consumption of omega-3 fatty acids (such as found in fish
oil) can partially replace the arachidoric acid in macrophages with
long-chain omega-3 fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA).
Other leukotrienes and prostaglandins are produced from EPA, and
these substances are less inflammatory than those produced from ara-
chidoric acid. During an inflammatory episode, fewer strong inflam-
 matory mediators are produced. Thus, the inflammatory response is
reduced. There are limited studies evaluating dose and effect, but a

CHAPTER 11
Obesity
Obesity is a common problem in pets. It has been estimated that 40%
of dogs and 30% of cats are obese. Pets that are less than 10% above
ideal weight are considered to be "above optimal" weight, pets
between 10% and 20% above ideal weight are considered overweight,
and those 20% or more above ideal body weight are obese. Overweight
and obese pets typically have an increase in body fat. Pets in optimal
body condition have 15%-20% body fat
Health Risks of Obesity
There are a number of conditions associated with or exacerbated
by obesity. Obese dogs have a reduction in longevity In a group of
Labrador retrievers, energy restriction prolonged life to an average of
13 years compared to ll years in the group that was not energy
restricted. The energy-restricted group weighed an average of 26% less
than the nonrestricted group.
Orthopedic disorders are common in obese pets. Obesity in large-
breed puppies during growth promotes the development of orthope-
dic problems and can exacerbate hip dysplasia. Torn cruciate ligaments

The frequency of cardiovascular disorders increases with obesity;
heart rhythm, ventricle volume, and plasma volume increase. The cor-
relation between hypertension and obesity is controversial. In dogs
there is a correlation between obesity and tracheal collapse.
135
136 SECTION 1 NUTRITION ANDDIETARY MANAGEMENT
Obesity is a major risk factor for diabetes mellitus in cats. Insulin
controls the uptake of glucose by cells, and obese cats have signifi-
cantly reduced sensitivity to insulir. Insulin resistance may also occur
in obese dogs fed diets high in fats.
 In humans there are correlations between obesity and certain types
of cancer (breast, uterus, colon, and prostate). However, in dogs and

Obese cats may be more likely to suffer from diarrhea. In cats there
is a strong association between hepatic lipidosis and obesity. Obese
cats that undergo rapid weight loss are at risk for development of
           
Hepatic lipidosis is further discussed in Chapter 20, Diet and Hepatic
Disease.
Risk Factors
The prevalence of obesity is influenced by a rumber of factors. Dog
breeds that appear to be at higher risk for the development of obesity
include the Saint Bernard, Bernese mountain dog, Newfoundland,
Labrador retriever, collie, golden retriever, Rottweiler, beagle, cocker
spaniel, basset hound, Cairn terrier, dachshund, Cavalier King Charles
spariel, and Scottish terrier. Dogs at decreased risk of obesity include
Doberman pinscher, German shepherd, greyhound, and Yorkshire
terrier. Mixed-breed cats are predisposed to obesity. Genetic factors in
the development of obesity are poorly understood.

prevalence of obesity in cats is highest in cats between 5 and 1l years
of age. Cats over 13 years of age have a decreased incidence of
obesity.
In dogs, intact females are more predisposed to obesity than are
intact males. In cats, intact males appear to have a higher incidence as
  so  s      
the frequency of obesity. The increase in obesity after neutering may
be due to a combination of factors, including a decrease in activity and
an increase in food intake due to a change in circulating hormone
concentrafions.
Decreased activity is also a primary factor in the development of
obesity. The duration of daily exercise is directly correlated to the
CHAPTER 11 OBESITY
137
incidence of obesity. Dogs living in apartments have a higher risk of
obesity than do those living outdoors.
 Interactions with owners also have an impact on the incidence of
obesity. Owners of obese pets tend to humarize their pets more, spend
more time talking to their pets, allow them to sleep on the bed, and
spend more time watching their pet eat. Obese pets also tend to receive
more treats than do pets of normal body weight.
Regulation of Body Weight
There are a number of hormones that regulate appetite, food con-
sumption, and energy expenditure. These hormones are currently the
and cholecystokinin. Results of many of these studies have been con-
fusing, and considerably more research is needed.
Leptin is secreted by fat cells and plays a role in the regulation of
food consumption. Leptin decreases food consumption and was ini-
tially thought to be a miracle cure for obesity. However, obese indi-
viduals do not have a deficiency in leptin; obese individuals actually
have higher levels of leptin due to increased secretion by fat. Obese
individuals appear to be resistant to the effects of leptin.
Ghrelin (GH-releasing hormone) stimulates the secretion of growth
hormone (GH), which increases food consumption. However, the con-
centration of ghrelin is actually lower in obese arimals as compared
to animals of normal body weight.
Adiponectin is also secreted by fat cells and plays a role in carbo-
hydrate metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and energy homeostasis.
Adiponectin expression is decreased in obese animals.
Cholecystokinin (CCK) is released in response to protein and fat in
the diet and acts to decrease the appetite. However, when CCK is
admiristered to patients, it does not appear to decrease appetite over
time.
Evaluation of Obesity
Objective measurement of obesity is challenging, especially in dogs
with their tremendous range of normal body size, depending on breed.
The first step is to obtain the current body weight and then to deter
mine an optimal body weight. A relative body weight can be calcu-
This can give an estimate of the level of obesity.

Body condition scoring is a subjective assessment of body fat com-
  s e s pss     g 
9-point scale. Body condition scoring is discussed in more detail in
Chapter 4. Briefly, on a 5-point scale, a body condition score (BCS) of
3 represents the middle of the optimal range, with BCS of 1 or 2 rep-
resenting underweight pets, and BCS of 4 or 5 representing over-
weight or obese pets. On a 9-point scale, BCS of 5 is the middle of the
optimal body weight range, with BCS of 1-4 representing varying
degrees of underweight pets, and BCS of 6-9 representing overweight/
               
body fat, and a BCS of 4 suggests about 30% body fat.
 d      o  s s
body fat. In the dog, the hock-to-stifle length is measured, along with
the pelvic circumference. In the cat, the body length from nose to
pelvis is measured, along with the right forelimb length, right hindlimb
surements are then used in complicated formulas to calculate the
estimated percentage of body fat. The measurements must be made in
exact positions, which can be difficult, especially in cats or uncoopera-
tive pets.
Weight-Reduction Plan
For obesity to develop, the caloric intake has to exceed the daily
calorie expenditure over a period of time. A weight-reduction
program includes determining the amount of weight to lose, deter-
miring daily caloric intake for weight loss, selecting a diet, determir-
ing the amount of exercise, monitoring progress, adjusting caloric
intake as needed, and preventing regaining of lost weight. An esti-
mate of daily caloric intake for weight loss in dogs can be found in
Table 4-3, and the estimate of daily caloric intake for weight loss in
cats can be obtained from Table 417. The calories estimated for
weight loss should be compared with the calories currently being
consumed to ensure that the calculated calories are less than what is
beingeaten.
When feeding for weight loss, treats and snacks should be elimi-
nated. If treats are going to be fed, then low-calorie snacks such as
vegetables (broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, etc.), popcorn without butter,
or ice cubes could be given. Calories supplied by treats need to be
taken into account in the daily calories allowed. Multiple meals should
be fed each day rather than one large meal.
CHAPTER 11OBESITY139
Starvation has been used to induce weight loss in dogs, but dogs
should be hospitalized and given only water plus vitamin and mineral
supplements under the direct supervision of a veterinarian. Starvation
carnot be used for weight loss in cats due to the risk of developing
hepatic lipidosis. Starvation leads to protein deficiency, with a loss of
lean muscle mass. Starvation should not be used at home to achieve
weight loss in dogs or cats.
After a weight-loss program has begun, the pet should be weighed
after 2 weeks. If there has been a loss of 0.5%-2% body weight per
week, then the current program can be continued and the pet weighed
again in 2-4 weeks. Weight loss should not be more than 2% per week
because a greater proportion of lean body mass will be lost if more
than that is lost during that time period. If weight loss has been less.
continue with the program but reweigh in 1-2 weeks. If the body
weight has increased, then decrease the calories fed by 10%-20% or
increase exercise and reweigh in 1-2 weeks.
Diets for Weight Loss
Energy restriction carnot be achieved by simply feeding less of the
current diet. Some restriction of a particular diet will result in deficien-
cies of essential nutrients. A diet specifically designed for weight
reduction should be fed to limit energy intake and to ensure that
essential nutrients are provided.
The energy content of the diet for weight loss should be reduced,
and this is typically accomplished by limiting the amount of fat in the
diet. Recommendations for energy density and fat content for diets are
             
cally higher than in diets for maintenance. This is necessary to provide

essential amino acids. High-protein diets help to maintain muscle
mass and facilitate the loss of fat. Proteins provide the same amount
 of metabolizable energy as do carbohydrates, but excess protein is not
stored as fat. In addition, proteins do not induce much insulin secre-
tion, thus preventing hypoglycemia and the feeling of hunger.
The use of fiber in weight-reduction diets is debated. The addition
of dietary fiber dilutes the energy density of the diet, and fiber at a
level of 20% dry matter (DM) will reduce the voluntary intake of the
diet. Increasing the fiber content increases the fecal quantity and fre-
quency of defecation. It can also decrease the digestibility of proteins
and minerals and decrease the palatability of the diet. Increasing
dietary fiber may cause flatulence and diarrhea. Increasing dietary
fiber can have some benefits for weight loss but is not necessary for
weight loss to occur.

Bone contains 25% water, 10% cells, and 65% inorganic material.
About 99% of total body calcium and 80% of total body phosphorus
are present in bone. Even though bone is solid, it is a very dynamic
organ, with new bone forming and bone resorbing constantly. Thus,
bone can serve as a large reservoir of calcium in the body. Cartilage
contains 70% water and 30% cells. The matrix of cartilage includes
glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Keratin sulfate and chondroitin sulfate
are the most important glycosaminoglycans.
Impact of Nutrition on Bone and Joints
In young growing animals, excessive energy intake results in a more
rapid rate of growth. Overfeeding puppies causes rapid bone length

growth and rapid weight gain. The increased weight adds more stress
to the skeleton and joints, which can lead to the development of osteo
chondrosis, hip dysplasia, and elbow dysplasia. Overnutrition is espe-
        
considerable rate of growth. Restricting the feeding of large-breed
puppies does not impact final body size. High-protein diets (30% DM)
      r     
supply the necessary energy. In adults, overfeeding leads to excess
body fat and obesity. Obesity is common and occurs in about 28%-44%
of dogs. Skeletal and joint disorders are commorly found in obese
dogs.
Excess calcium intake can also cause skeletal and joint abnormali-
ties. Dietary calcium is absorbed in the small intestine, and puppies
less than 6 months of age lack the physiological mecharisms to prevent
excess calcium absorption. Thus, young puppies can absorb about 50%
of the calcium present in the diet. When dietary calcium is absorbed,
the hormone calcitorin is released to prevent a sharp increase in serum
calcium. Calcitonin acts on bone to prevent resorption, and remodel-
ing of bone carnot occur. Chroric excesses of dietary calcium cause
chroric high levels of calcitorin, with an overall decrease in bone
remodeling. Thus, there is a disturbance in the normal mineralization
of bone. Safe calcium intake appears to be 260-830mg calcium/kg/
day at 2 months of age and 210-540mg calcium/kg/day at 5 morths

development. Excess phosphorus intake is common in pets fed all-
meat diets. The increase in phosphorus decreases the calcium/phos-
 phorusratio and can lead tonutritionalsecondary hyperparathyroidism
and bone fractures. However, in young growing dogs, the absolute
intake of calcium appears to be more important than the calcium/
phosphorus ratio.
Copper is important for maintenance of cornective tissue. Copper

bones, decreased appetite, and decreased weight gain. Vitamin A defi-
ciency results in weight loss, decreased appetite, and disturbances in
bone remodeling.
Vitamin C is important in the formation of cartilage; however, diets
deficiert in vitamin C do not cause skeletal problems. Excess vitamin
C from supplementation can erhance calcium absorption, leading to
excess calcium, which could increase the risk for skeletal disorders.
Dogs do not require vitamin C, and supplementation is not
recommended.
Disorders Due to Nutritional Excesses
Hip Dysplasia
Hip dysplasia (HD) is a common disorder that is heritable. Dogs
g Aq Ansn 'doap H inq 'sd eu m q ae H 
months of age, due to different rates of development of bones and the
supporting muscles, ligaments, and joint capsule.
Some breeds have an increased incidence of HD, including
Rottweilers, St. Berrards, German shepherds, Bernese mountain dogs,
Labrador retrievers, and Golden retrievers. Clirical signs of HD
include pain when getting up, decreased range of motion, lameness
of the hind limbs, and a "bunny-hopping" gait. Clinical signs may be
worse at the start of exercise and get better as exercise progresses.
Signs may get worse with rest after exercise. Radiographs of the hips
   r ae   p si  ss a
changes present.
The head of the thigh bone (femur) normally sits into the hip socket
(acetabulum). Both the head of the femur and acetabulum are mostly
cartilage at birth. If the hip joint is loose, with increased laxity, the
head of the femur touches the acetabulum, causing abnormal pres-
sures. This causes small fractures in the acetabulum and improper
formation of bone. Excess body weight increases the load on the hip
joints and can increase the severity of HD. Excess calcium intake alters
the proper maturation of the skeleton and plays a role in the deforma-
tion of the hip joint. Electrolyte balance may also be important in the
development of HD. Diets creating acidosis have detrimental effects
on skeletal formation. Excess vitamin D has a negative impact on
ossification of bone and can lead to deformation of the hip joint.
HD may not be preventable, but signs and severity can be mini
mized. Puppies should be kept lean, and overfeeding and obesity
146 SECTION 1 NUTRITION ANDDIETARY MANAGEMENT
should be avoided. The calcium content of the diet should be appropri-
ate and not excessive. Diets designed and balanced for young growing
dogs should not be supplemented with excessive calcium.
Once HD has developed, weight loss and maintenance of proper
body weight will help minimize the clirical signs. Surgery may be an
option in selected cases.
 Elbow Dysplasia
There are a number of disorders that comprise elbow dysplasia
(ED), including osteochondritis dissecans (OCD), unurited anconeal
process, and fragmented coronoid process. Most dogs with ED are less
than l year of age and have a "turring out" of the affected front leg.
There may be pain on motion of the joint, lameness, and a decreased
of ED affect both front legs.
Breeds at increased risk of ED include Rottweilers, Bernese moun-
tain dogs, Labrador retrievers, golden retrievers, Newfoundlands,
German shepherds, St. Bernards, bloodhounds, Bouvier des Flandres,
and chow chows. Overfeeding and excessive calcium intake can con-
tribute to the severity of ED. Once ED is present, surgery and weight
loss may improve ED.
 Osteochondrosis
With osteochondrosis, there is abnormal maturation of chondro
retained and becomes thick; this cartilage can detach and may frag-
ment or become mineralized. If articular cartilage is involved, osteo-
chondritis dissecans (OCD) may result. OCD is seen primarily in giant
breeds. If growth plates are involved, there can be a decreased length
of bone and curvature of bones.
If there is no detachment of cartilage, no clinical signs are present.
With OCD, clirical signs include lameness and pain on extension and
flexion of the joint. The most common joints affected are the shoulder,
elbow, stifle, and hock.
Osteochondrosis is most common in large breeds of dogs, especially
Great Danes, Newfoundlands, Rottweilers, Labrador retrievers, and
golden retrievers. Most dogs with OCD have more than one joint
affected. The shoulder and stifle of Great Danes; the elbows of
Newfoundlands; the shoulder, elbow and hocks of Labradors and
 golden retrievers; and shoulder and hocks of Rottweilers are the most
common sites of OCD.
Excess energy intake or excess calcium intake play a sigrificant role
in the development of osteochondrosis. Energy intake needs to be
controlled in young growing puppies to prevent an overweight puppy.
Fast-growing puppies should have their body condition monitored
closely so that energy intake can be controlled. Calcium should be
provided at the proper amount in the diet.
Diseases Due to Decreased Skeletal Remodeling
Canine wobbler syndrome and enostosis are two diseases character-
ized by a decrease in skeletal remodeling. In carine wobbler syn-
drome, there is compression of the spinal cord due to changes in the
spinal canal. Pain with extension of the neck and uncoordination of
the hind limbs are seen in growing large-breed dogs less than 6 months
of age. There is an increased incidence in Great Danes, mastiffs, and
Irish wolfhounds.
Enostosis (eosinophilic panosteitis) is characterized by shifting
lameness in young dogs. Long bones are affected, and pain is noted
On palpation of bones. The German shepherd dog is at increased risk
of enostosis.
Chroric excessive intake of calcium results in high calcium absorp-
fion, and there is a decrease in bone osteoclast activity, with a decrease
in bone remodelirg. Diets containing the proper amount of calcium
should be fed.
Diseases Due to Nutritional Deficiencies
Nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism and rickets are disorders
characterized by loss of bone density that leads to fractures. Deficiency
of calcium results in nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism, and
lack of dietary vitamin D causes rickets. Nutritional secondary hyper-
parathyroidism is discussed in detail in Chapter 17.
Feeding the Growing Puppy
Controlling the growth rate of growing puppies, especially those of
larger breeds, helps to decrease the incidence and severity of skeletal
148SECTION1NUTRITION ANDDIETARY MANAGEMENT
and joint problems. Urnfortunately, many people feel that a big, roly-
poly puppy is ideal. However, this is incompatible with the develop-
       r g 
          
proper skeletal and joint development. Puppies should be fed to main-
tain a lean body condition and should not be allowed to become
overweight. Body condition should be checked at least every other
week, and the amount of diet fed should be adjusted to prevent exces-
sive weight gain. Keeping a puppy lean does not restrict maximum
adult size, but it does help to prevent skeletal issues. Free-choice
feeding is discouraged, as many puppies will overeat and consume

provides an easy method for ensuring that the proper amount of diet
is being consumed. Refer to Chapter 4 for general guidelines on the
proper amount of energy to feed to growing puppies.
Osteoarthrosis
Osteoarthrosis (osteoarthritis) is a common orthopedic problem in
older dogs, and also affects some cats. Clirical signs include
decreased weight bearing, pain especially when getting up, decreased
range of motion, and swollen joints. Osteoarthrosis is associated with
aging, and overloading of the joint either from obesity or excessive
use is the common cause. In osteoarthrosis the joint is not lubricated,
and the cartilage does not receive enough nutrients, which damages
the cartilage. Cartilage damage causes inflammation within the joint,
and inflammatory mediators are released. The inflammatory media
tors then cause release of certain factors that cause more joint
damage.
In osteoarthrosis, both medical and nutritional management is
important. Weight loss in overweight dogs is a main goal of therapy.
A number of dietary supplements have been used in the treatment of
osteoarthrosis. Some of these supplements are classified as rnutraceu-
ticals. The North American Veterinary Nutraceutical Council defines
       s

required for normal body structure and function and administered
with the intent of improving the health and well being of arimals."
Supplements that have been used as treatment include glucosamine,
chondroitin sulfate, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic
acid (DHA), antioxidants, and green-lipped mussel.

cial in treatment, as it contains EPA, DHA, chondroitin, and gluta
mine. Further work is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of these
supplements.

CHAPTER 13
Diet and Gastrointestinal
Disease
Gastrointestinal Physiology
The digestive tract is a large organ that provides a protective barrier
from the envirorment and absorbs nutrients. The mucosal barrier of
the gastrointestinal (Gl) tract protects the body from invasion by bac-
teria, toxins, and other harmful agents. The gut-associated lymphoid
fissue (GALT) plays an important role in mounting an inflammatory
response against toxic agents. Damage to any part of the GI tract can
result in invasion of harmful substances and a decrease in absorption
of nutrients.
The small intestine is the primary site for digestion and nutrient
absorption. The small intestine is characterized by the presence of
many villi and microvilli, which increase the surface area of the small
intestine and provide a greater area for absorption of nutrients.
Enterocytes are specialized cells in the mucosa of the small intestine
that contain enzymes necessary for absorption of nutrients.
 Digestion and Absorption
When dietary protein reaches the stomach, the enzyme pepsin
starts the digestive process. Once proteins reach the small intestine,
pancreatic enzymes and enzymes from the brush border of the small
intestine digest the proteins. As a result of digestion, small peptides
and amino acids are released and can be absorbed by the small intes-
tine cells.
Ingested fats combine with bile acids in the small intestine and then
can be digested by the pancreatic enzymes lipase, phospholipase, and
151
152SECTION1 NUTRITION ANDDIETARY MANAGEMENT
cholesterol esterase. Triglycerides are broken down to monoglycerides
and free fatty acids. Bile acids help with the absorption of the mono
glycerides and free fatty acids by forming micelles that can associate
with small intestine cells. Once these are absorbed, the bile acids are
reabsorbed in the ileum and are transported back to the liver where
they can again be released at a later time. Once the free fatty acids and
become incorporated into chylomicrons within the small intestine
cells, and then are secreted into the lymphatic charnels.
Ingested carbohydrates are digested by pancreatic amylase, pro-
ducing maltose. Maltose, along with sucrose and lactose, are digested
by enzymes from the brush border of the small intestine, producing
monosaccharides. These monosaccharides can then be transported
through the intestinal cell into the portal circulation.
Minerals are absorbed in both the small and large intestine. The
absorption of calcium in the small intestine is tightly regulated and is
controlled by calcium metabolic hormones. Phosphorus, zinc, iron,
and manganese absorption are also regulated. Sodium, potassium,
and chloride are about 90% absorbed in the small intestine. Most other
minerals are absorbed by passive diffusion. The fat-soluble vitamins
(A, D, E, and K) are absorbed in micelles, along with free fatty acids
and monoglycerides. The water-soluble vitamins are absorbed by
passive diffusion.
 Intestinal Microflora
There is a population of bacteria that normally lives within the
intestinal tract. This bacterial population stimulates the immune
         
pathogens. There is a higher concentration of bacteria in the large
intestine as compared to the small intestine. The bacterial flora is
dependent on intestinal motility, nutrients present in the intestine, and
Gl secretions (gastric acid, bile acid, pancreatic enzymes). The proper
concentration of bacteria in the intestine is urknown, so it can be dif-
ficult to determine when bacteria are present in excess. Diet ingredi-
ents influence the bacterial composition in the intestine; high-protein
diets favor the growth of clostridial bacteria, whereas fermentable
fiber favors the growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli
Gastrointestinal Immune System
Ihe Gl tract contairs the most immune cells in the body. The GALT
includes the mesenteric lymph nodes, Peyer's patches, and lymphoid
CHAPTER 13 DIET AND GIDISEASE  153
follicles. The immune cells include T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes,
plasma cells, macrophages, eosinophils, and mast cells. A good
       s  
Gl tract must also not overreact to dietary ingredients or normal intes-
tinal bacterial flora, so mucosal tolerance is important. If every sub-
stance presented to the Gl tract was regarded as foreign, there would
be a continual state of inflammation. A breakdown in mucosal toler
ance is implicated in irflammatory bowel disease. How exactly GALT
maintains mucosal tolerance is not clear
Oral Disorders
Irflammatory conditions of the oral cavity are uncommon and include
eosinophilic granuloma complex, granulomas, stomatitis, and inflam-
mation due to radiation therapy of the head and neck. Cleft palate is
the most common congerital problem of the oral cavity. Trauma can
occur from fighting, falls, burns, vehicle accidents, and foreign bodies
Oral neoplasia is not uncommon and is the fourth most common cause
of cancer in dogs and cats.
Clirical signs of oral disease include difficulty eating or a reluctance
to eat. Many pets with oral disorders also have difficulty drinking, so
dehydration is a common problem. Energy-dense foods should be fed
to provide a high number of calories in a small quantity of food.
Adding water to the diet to provide a gruel or slurry and feeding
multiple small meals during the day may help to promote intake.
Growth or performance-type diets may be best to provide an increased
energy density.
Swallowing Disorders
Swallowing disorders are uncommon in dogs and rare in cats but can
have a profound impact on nutrition. Swallowing problems result
from disorders of both the pharyrx and esophagus. The most common
swallowing disorders are due to problems with motility (megaesopha-
gus), inflammation (esophagitis, gastroesophageal reflux), or obstruc-
tion (strictures, foreign bodies).
Clirical signs of swallowing disorders include coughing or gagging
when trying to swallow, excessive salivation, pain on swallowing.
gurgling noises, and regurgitation of undigested food immediately
after eating. Aspiration pneumonia is not uncommon from aspiration
during regurgitation.
154
SECTION 1NUTRITION ANDDIETARYMANAGEMENT
 Megaesophagus
Megaesophagus occurs when a motility disorder affecting the
esophagus results in a large and flaccid esophagus. Congenital mega-
esophagus is most common in the Chinese Shar-Pei, fox terrier,
German shepherd dog, Great Dane, Irish setter, Labrador retriever,
miniature schnauzer, Newfoundland, wire-haired fox terrier, and
Siamese cat. Acquired megaesophagus is most common in the German
shepherd dog. golden retriever, Great Dane, and Irish setter. The exact
reasons that megaesophagus occurs are unknown, but it is related to
weight loss also occurs. Aspiration pneumoria is a common
complication.
Diets for pets with megaesophagus should be a slurry or liquid. The
more liquid a diet, the easier for the diet to pass through the esophagus
and reach the stomach, decreasing the likelihood of regurgitation.
Diets should be thoroughly mixed in a blender with added water.
Multiple small meals should be fed throughout the day and should be
fed with the dog or cat in an upright position. Feeding bowls should
not be put on the floor since the pet would have to flex the neck to eat.
Bowls can be propped up so that the neck does not need to be flexed,
or special elevated feeding platforms can be purchased. Pets should
be kept in an upright position for 10-15 minutes after feeding to allow
greater than 25% dry matter (DM) fat is best (Table 13.1).
 Esophagitis
Esophagitis is an inflammation of the esophagus and can result
from foreign bodies, oral medications, heat injuries, or gastroesopha-
geal reflux. In cases of esophagitis from gastroesophageal reflux, the
fat content in the diet should be less than 15% DM (Table 13.1). High
dietary fat promotes gastroesophageal reflux due to delayed gastric
emptying times and should be avoided. Protein content should be

greater than 25% DM to enhance esophageal sphincter tore. Food

 Obstructive Disorders (Strictures, Foreign Body)
Strictures can occur from scarring, or from congerital conditions
Dietary treatment is similar to that for megaesophagus (Table 13.1).
 An energy-dense food fed in multiple small meals daily is best. Diets
should be a slurry or liquid.
Stomach Disorders
Vomiting
Vomiting is common and can be associated with both Gl and non-GI
diseases. Frequent or profuse vomiting can lead to serious metabolic
consequences. If vomiting is mild and of short duration, then typically
there is not a significant fluid loss or electrolyte abnormalities.
However, if vomiting is profuse and frequent, significant fluid loss can
result, leading to dehydration. Electrolyte imbalances are common
r d s s    as 
kalemia), decreased serum sodium (hyponatremia), and decreased
serum chloride (hypochloremia). Aspiration pneumoria and esopha-
gitis can occur as a result of vomiting. Nausea may precede vomiting-
Signs of nausea include salivation, licking of the lips, or retching.
The type of vomiting may give an indication as to its cause. If the
vomit contains undigested food more than 12 hours after a meal, then
a delay in gastric emptying is suspected. Projectile vomiting indicates
gastric outflow obstruction or upper small intestine obstruction. The
underlying cause of vomiting should be determined and treated.
The oral intake of food should be restricted to minimize vomiting
and fluid loss. Food should be withheld for 12-24 hours. If vomiting
resolves, then a highly digestible, fat-restricted diet should be fed.
After a few days on the fat-restricted diet, the pet's regular diet can be
reintroduced over a period of a few days.
■ Hairballs
Hairballs are a common problem in cats because of their grooming
behavior. Ingested hair accumulates in the stomach in a loose ball and
156
SECTION 1NUTRITION ANDDIETARYMANAGEMENT
is occasionally regurgitated. Hairballs typically are not a problem in
most cats urless they form a large hard ball in the stomach. There are
a rumber of laxative or lubricant products available on the market for
the treatment and prevention of hairballs. Special diets are not typi-
cally necessary. If cats exhibit regurgitation daily, or have diarrhea,
weight loss, loss of appetite, or abdominal pain, then they should be
evaluated for an underlying Gl disorder.
 Gastritis
Acute gastritis is usually a mild condition with acute vomiting that
resolves within 24-48 hours. Chroric gastritis can be problematic as
vomiting may be more chroric. The chroric inflammation can also
interfere with gastric motility, leading to further vomiting. There are
many possible causes of gastritis, including dietary indiscretion,
drugs, viral infections, bacterial infections, parasitic infections, or sys-
temic disorders (liver disease, renal disease, shock, stress, and others).
Older pets are more likely to have a metabolic or neoplastic cause of
gastritis. Hemorrhagic gastroenteritis is more common in dachshunds,
Water is an important rutrient for any vomiting patient. Loss of
water can lead to dehydration, and water deficits should be replaced
using intravenous or subcutaneous fluid therapy if it is severe.
Antigens from proteins may play a role in some cases of chronic
gastritis; thus, it may be beneficial to choose a diet with a novel protein
source. The protein source should be highly digestible, and excess
protein should be avoided (Table 13.2). Fat should be moderately
restricted since high-fat diets are retained in the stomach for a longer
period of time. Diets for gastritis should contain less than 15% DM fat
for dogs and less than 22% DM fat for cats.

CHAPTER 13 DIET AND GI DISEASE
157
Since chroric vomiting can lead to loss of electrolytes, diets should
contain potassium, sodium, and chloride in concentrations above the
recommended minimums.
With gastritis, food is typically withheld for about 24 hours, and if
there is no vomiting, then small amounts of water or ice cubes are
offered. If water is tolerated, then the pet is fed the recommended diet
sumed in one meal. If this is tolerated, then after a few days, the pets
regular diet may be reintroduced over several days.
 Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus
Gastric dilatation (GD) occurs when the stomach becomes dis-
tended with gas, fluid, and air. Gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV)
occurs when the stomach thern rotates on its axis and entraps gas and
the stomach, spleen, and pancreas. GDV is a surgical emergency with
a high mortality rate. GDV is most common in deep-chested, large-
breed dogs. Breeds at risk include Great Danes, Irish setters, Gordon
setters, Weimaraners, Saint Bernards, Doberman pinschers and basset
hounds. The retriever breeds have a lower risk for GDV. GD ard GDV
 m so 'o  so p    
nervous temperament, or dogs that are underweight are at higher risk.
Nausea, belching, and vomiting are clirical signs of GD. Vomiting
may not be present, and the dog may just be reluctant to move and
make grunting sounds. GDV usually occurs acutely, often at right or
in the early morring. A stressful event such as boarding, travel, or
 s  d  sa s   
GDV are restless, have abdominal distention, increased salivation,
abdominal pain, and nonproductive vomiting.
Dietary risk factors have been identified for the occurrence of GD
 a rd      g   
eating, drinking large amounts of water, and postprandial exercise
have all been implicated. In one study, the inclusion of moist foods or
table foods in the diet decreased the risk of GDV. It had been previ-
ously thought that the feeding of commercial dry pet foods increased
the risk of GDV; however, in a controlled study comparing dry foods
to a wet diet, there was no difference in the incidence of GDV. Soybeans
in the diet had once been implicated as a possible cause, but this has
also been disproven in long-term feeding studies. Eating behaviors
such as rapid food consumption, excitement, and exercise increase the
amount of swallowed air, which increases the risk for GDV. Thus,

SECTION 1 NUTRITION ANDDIETARYMANAGEMENT
eating behaviors that increase the risk of GDV should be minimized,
 n  e   a rs    s  
no competition for food. If the dog still eats too fast, the diet can be
portioned out into muffin tins to make it more difficult for the dog to
eat quickly. Large balls or rocks can also be placed in the food bowl
so that the dog must pick the diet from around the obstacles. Limiting
the amount of exercise for three to four hours after feeding is advised.
Gastric Motility Disorders
gastric contractions that cause delayed emptying of food from the
stomach. There are many causes of decreased gastric motility, includ-
ing high-fat diets, drugs, inflammation, pancreatitis, nervous inhibi-
fion (stress, trauma, or pain), hypothyroidism, decreased serum
potassium, and vagal nerve damage. Abdominal distention, discom-
fort after eating. vomiting of undigested food more than 12 hours after
eating, belching, and loss of appetite are clirical signs of gastric motil-
ity disorders. Weight loss and a thin body condition may be present
if the condition is chroric. Some may have severe vomiting with
dehydration.
Some breeds may be at increased risk of gastric motility disorders
 sis     n  
more common in Siamese cats and brachycephalic breeds of dogs.
Chroric hypertrophic pyloric gastropathy is most common in middle.
aged Lhasa apsos, Maltese, shih tzu, and Pekingese dogs. Gastric
foreign bodies are more common in young dogs, and neoplasia that
obstructs gastric outflow is more common in older dogs.
Dehydration is common with gastric motility disorders as a result
of the persistent vomiting. Fluid deficits should be corrected with fluid
therapy (intravenous or subcutaneous), and water should be available
as free choice. Cold water (below room temperature) should be avoided
because this can delay gastric emptying.
Pets with gastric motility disorders are often underweight because
of inadequate caloric intake over a period of time. However, it is dif-
ficult to provide a very energy-dense diet without increasing the
dietary fat content. Urfortunately, diets high in fat delay gastric emp-
tying. A high fat content in the duodenum stimulates the release of
cholecystokinin, which slows gastric emptying. Thus, the dietary fat
content should be less than 15% DM for dogs and less than 22% DM
for cats (Table 13.3). Liqtid diets are emptied from the stomach faster

Diarrhea
Diarrhea is not truly a disease process but rather is a clirical sign of
some underlying disorder. Diarrhea can be acute or chronic and can
originate from the small intestine or large intestine.
Acute Diarrhea
Acute diarrhea is characterized by an abnormal frequency and con-
sistency of the stool, and it is the most common sign of intestinal
disease in the dog. Diarrhea occurs when intestinal absorption is
decreased, intestinal secretions have increased, or a combination of the
two occurs.
Depending on clirical signs, dogs may be categorized as having
mild diarrhea or moderate/severe diarrhea. In mild cases, dogs are
alert and active, have no evidence of dehydration, and have had less
than three to four episodes of diarrhea within 24 hours, with no blood
in the stool. Dogs with moderate illness exhibit dehydration, depres-
sion, more frequent episodes of diarrhea (more than six per day), and
blood in the stool.
Causes of acute diarrhea include dietary indiscretions, dietary intol
erance, infectious agents, intestinal parasites, drugs and toxins, and
 a n  a a so n s s

tions include eating table scraps, eating spoiled food, overeating.

poor-quality water. Dietary intolerances are most commorly to dairy
products and fat. Ingestion of milk or cheese in many dogs can cause
mild diarrhea.
Irfectious causes of diarrhea can be viral, bacterial, rickettsial, or
fungal. Viral causes include parvovirus, coronavirus, and rotavirus.
Parvovirus is a common cause of severe diarrhea in young, nonvac-
cinated dogs. Coronavirus is also common in nonvaccinated dogs,
but typically the diarrhea is not as severe as that seen in parvovirus.
Bacterial causes include  Satmonelfa, Clostridium, Campyfobacter,
Escherichia coli, Yersinia, and Bacillus piliformis. Rickettsial diarrhea is
most often caused by Neorickettsia, and fungal agents can cause
acute diarrhea but are more commorly associated with chroric
diarrheas.
Intestinal parasitism is one of the most common causes of acute

Dogs with mild diarrhea will recover with minimal therapy, and
therefore orly minimal testing and treatment is necessary. Dogs with
moderate diarrhea require more extensive testing and treatmert, since
they are more likely to have metabolic abnormalities. In mild diarrhea,
examiring the stool for parasites is the first diagnostic test that should

appear in every fecal sample. Even if dogs are on a regular worming
schedule, fecal examinations are still of value, since a regular worming
program is not aimed at prevention of Giardia or coccidia. Dogs that
have been recently wormed (within the last month) may become reir-
fected, and depending on the agent used for worming, all parasites

examination is of benefit. Depending on age and vaccination status,
the presence of fecal parvoviral antigen may be tested. Blood work
should include a PCV (packed cell volume) and total protein, to assess
dehydration and protein loss.
CHAPTER 13 DIET AND GIDISEASE
161
Dogs with moderate to severe diarrhea require more extensive
testing. In addition to multiple fecal examinations, a CBC (complete
blood count) and blood biochemistry panel should be performed,
since dehydration and metabolic abnormalities are common in these
patients.
Dogs with mild diarrhea are typically treated as outpatients,
whereas those with moderate to severe diarrhea are usually hospital-
ized for intensive therapy. Any underlying cause of disease (such as
parasites) should be treated with the appropriate therapy. In cases of
acute diarrhea, dietary modification is an important aspect of treat-
ment, though there are two thoughts on feeding. Traditionally, food
intake has been restricted for at least 24 hours, then is gradually
returned to normal. A bland diet consisting of highly digestible car-
bohydrates and protein is offered frequently and in small quantities.
s  a  a a id   
include cooked chicken (with no skin), lean hamburger, and eggs.
An alternative approach to dietary therapy is to continue to feed
though clirical signs are present decreases the morbidity in dogs with
parvovirus. This is not very practical, however, if vomiting is present.
One danger with feeding in the face of clinical signs is that the altered
permeability of the intestine may allow increased dietary antigens to
be absorbed. Thus, hypersensitivity to dietary protein may develop. It
may be prudent to feed a novel dietary protein source if using this
alternative approach.
        s  
aimed at rehydrating the patient and correcting an electrolyte imbal-
ance. In mild cases, oral fluid therapy is effective and economical. In
moderate to severe cases, either subcutaneous or intravenous therapy
will be required.
Pharmacological therapy may include motility modulators, antise-
cretory agents, intestinal protectants, or antibiotics. Motility modula-
tors should be used orly in those patients with diarrhea so severe that
fluid balance carnot be maintained. Motility modulators cause the
transit time of the intestine to increase, allowing more time for water
reabsorption. These should not be used for more than a few days due
to the side effects that are associated with them. Anticholinergics
decrease intestinal tone and reduce intestinal secretions. They may
worsen the diarrhea in some dogs, however, and should not be used
in cases of intestinal obstruction or in dogs with glaucoma. Narcotic
analgesics are potent inhibitors of intestinal secretions. They also
increase segmental contractions in the intestine, increasing resistance
162
SECTION 1 NUTRITION AND DIETARY MANAGEMENT
to passage of intestinal contents and decreasing fluid influx. Narcotic
analgesics may cause depression, corfusion, gastrointestinal atony,
pancreatitis, and loss of appetite. They should not be used in patients
with liver disease or bacterial gastrointestinal disease.
Antisecretory agents include anticholinergics, chlorpromazine,
opiates, and salicylates. Chlorpromazine inhibits intracellular calmod-
ulin, which increases in dogs with secretory diarrhea. Opiates decrease
secretions and increase absorption. This may be due to a slower transit
time, which allows for increased absorption. Salicylates inhibit pros-
taglandins and thereby decrease intestinal secretions that may be
caused by enterotoxins.
Intestinal protectants include the bismuth subsalicylate products
products have limited value in pets with severe diarrhea, since they
have not been shown to alter fluid and electrolyte losses.
Antibiotics are only indicated in dogs with bacterial causes of intes-
tinal disease or in dogs that are passing blood in the feces due to bacte-
rial invasion of the intestinal mucosa. The use of antibiotics
indiscriminately in diarrhea is ineffective and potentially harmful.
They may irhibit the rormal bacterial flora of the intestine, which is
detrimental to recovery. Antibiotics should not be administered in
conjunction with intestinal protectants, since they become bound to
the protectants and are thus ineffective.
e   a a     s 
           
therapy within this period need further testing and treatment to pin-
point the cause of diarrhea.
 Chronic Diarrhea
Chroric diarrhea is defined as a change in frequency, volume, or
consistency of the stool that persists for 3 or more weeks. Chroric
diarrhea may be episodic and can be due to problems in either the
small or large intestine. The mecharisms of chroric diarrhea include
increased fluid excretion into the intestine, decreased fluid absorption
by the intesfine, altered intesfiral permeability, or abrormal gastroin-
testinal motility.
Clirical signs of small intestine and large intestine diarrhea differ.
In chronic diarrheas caused by small intestine disease, there is a larger
volume of stool than normal, and the frequency of defecation is mod-
erately above normal (two to four stools per day). Weight loss is usual,
and there may be dark blood in the stool. Mucus is typically not
CHAPTER 13 DIET AND GI DISEASE
163
present in the stool. Usually there is no straining, and some dogs may
exhibit vomiting.
In chroric diarrheas caused by large intestine disease, there is a
smaller volume of stool than with small intestine diarrheas. The fre-
quency of defecation is increased (more than four times per day), and
usually there is no weight loss. Bright red blood or mucus may be
 present in the stool. Straining is not uncommon, and vomiting is rare.
Pets experiencing chroric diarrhea should be examined by a veteri
narian to determine the cause. On physical examination, dogs with
small intestine diarrheas usually exhibit poor body condition if they
have malabsorption, maldigestion, or protein-losing enteropathies.
Abdominal palpation may reveal masses or thickened bowel loops.
Rectal palpation is important and may reveal irregularities or thicken-
ing of the large bowel, masses, or strictures.
There are many potential causes of small intestine diarrheas.
Inflammatory causes such as enteritis, lymphangiectasia, neoplasia,
and bacterial or fungal infections from histoplasmosis, Salmonella,
Clostridium perfringens, and phycomycosis, may be causes. Also, para-
sites such as Giardia, ascarids, hookworms, and strongyloides are
common causes of small bowel diarrhea. Partial obstruction due to
foreign bodies, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, short bowel syn-
drome, or duodenal ulcers may be primary causes of this type of diar-
rhea as well.
In addition to primary small intestinal disease, maldigestion due to
enzymes) or hepatic disease is not uncommon. Dietary sensitivities
may be a problem, such as gluter-sensifive enteropathy in Irish setters
Metabolic disorders, such as liver disease and Addison's disease, or
uremia, toxins, and drug administration may all cause small intestine
diarrheas.
There are also many causes of large intestine diarrheas. Irflammatory
causes such as colitis, norinflammatory causes such as intussuscep-
tion, neoplasia, and bacterial irfections from histoplasmosis, C. perfrin-
gens, Salmonella, Campylobacter jejuni, and Prototheca, may be causes.
Also, parasites such as whipworms (Trichuris), Giardia, Ancylostoma.
Entamoeba, and Balantidium are common causes of large bowel
diarrheas.
In addition to the above primary causes of large intestine diarrhea,
other factors such as the eating of garbage or foreign material (bones,
hair), feeding a poorly digestible diet, irritable bowel syndrome,
uremia, Addison's disease, toxins, or drugs may cause large bowel
diarrheas.
164SECTION1 NUTRITION ANDDIETARY MANAGEMENT
Diagnosis of causes of chronic diarrheas can be difficult, and may
require extensive laboratory testing. A CBC and a serum biochemistry
panel should be analyze, to determine hydration status and to assess
Routine fecal flotation, along with zinc sulfate centrifugation for the
diagnosis of Giardia, should be performed. Direct microscopic exami-
nation of feces may reveal orgarisms associated with fungal or inflam
matory diseases. Fecal cultures may be indicated if bacterial infections
are suspected, and Sudan Black staining of feces for fecal fat may be
necessary if malabsorption or maldigestion is suspected.
 If exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is suspected, tests such as tryp-
sin-like immunoreactivity (TLl) may be done. If malabsorption is sus-
pected, a xylose absorption test or serum folate or cobalamin levels
may be analyzed.
In addition, abdominal radiographs and/or ultrasound may be
indicated to assess intestinal thickering, masses, or foreign bodies. If
malabsorption, parasites, and infectious causes have been ruled out,
then endoscopy and biopsy of the stomach and upper small intestine
are usually required for a definitive diagnosis. If diseases of the colon
are suspected, a colonoscopy can be performed.
Ireatment depends on whether the small or large intestine is
affected. With small intestine diarrheas, the underlying disease must
be treated. Symptomatic treatments are rarely successful. Resolution
of chronic diarrhea is very gradual, and it may take weeks of treatment
before a return to rormal stool is seen. Even when treating the under-
lying disease, complete resolution of the diarrhea may not be possible,
especially in pets with intestinal neoplasia, lymphangiectasia, or his-
toplasmosis. With large intestine diarrheas, therapeutic deworming
for whipworms is usually performed, since many dogs with whip-
worm infections appear negative on fecal examination. In addition, a

weeks. If response to treatment is poor, surgery may be indicated to
manually examine the intestine for evidence of disease.
 Pathogenesis of Diarrhea
There are four basic categories of diarrhea: osmotic diarrhea, secre
tory diarrhea, increased intestinal permeability, or intestinal motility
disorders.
Osmotic diarrhea is the most common cause of diarrhea in dogs
and cats and occurs when poorly absorbed solutes are present in the
intestinal lumen. Ingestion of large amounts of nondigestible fiber or
CHAPTER 13 DIET AND GI DISEASE
165
malassimilation of ingested food retard water absorption in the intes
tine, leading to an increased amount of water present in the stool
Causes of osmotic diarrhea include maldigestion, malabsorption,
admiristration of osmotic laxatives, and overeating. Osmotic diarrhe2
is characterized by the passage of large amounts of fluid or soft stools.
This type of diarrhea usually resolves within 24-36 hours after fasting.
Secretory diarrhea is relatively uncommon and is caused by bacte
rial enterotoxins, gastrointestinal hormones, prostaglandins, bile acids
and certain laxatives. Large volumes of liquid diarrhea are passed, and
dehydration occurs rapidly.
Increased permeability causes an increased flux of liquid into the
intestine and can be caused by inflammatory processes. This is a
      s  s     
large intestine origin. Diseases that cause Gl erosions, ulceration, or
mucosal inflammation can potentially increase the permeability of the
diarrhea does not always resolve with fasting.
Motility disorders can be either a primary problem or secondary tc
some other condition. Decreased intestinal motility can result in small
intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and the response to dietary manage
ment is variable.
Small Intestine Disorders
Acute Enteritis
Acute enteritis is common in dogs and cats, characterized by the
sudden onset of vomiting and diarrhea. There are a number of poten-
tial causes of acute enteritis, including dietary indiscretion, foreign
body ingestion, bacterial infection, parasitic infection, viral infection,
Clostridium, E. coli, Salmonella, Staphylococcus, and Yersinia. Parasites
causing acute enteritis include roundworms, hookworms, Giardia, and
coccidia. Viruses that cause acute enteritis include canine distemper
coronavirus, parleukoperia, parvovirus, and rotavirus.
Acute diarrhea is the most common clinical sign and may be accom-
paried by vomiting. Diarrhea originating from the small intestine has
different characteristics than diarrhea originating from the large intes-
tine (Table 13.4).
Diets for acute enteritis should contain moderate fat concentrations

is useful for patients with nausea. For dogs, the dietary fat content
should be 12%-15% DM, and 15%-22% DM for cats (Table 13.5). The
energy density of the diet should be moderate so that small meals can
be fed. Very low-fiber diets are fed (<l% DM). Potassium, sodium, and
chloride concentratiors may be low in patierts with acute enteritis due
to the loss in vomit and feces. Diets should provide above the mirimum
concentrations for potassium, sodium, and chloride. Glutamine is an

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) refers to a group of disorders
that cause inflammatory cells to invade the Gl mucosa.
cats and is characterized by an invasion of lymphocytes and plasma
cells. In most cases the cause of the inflammation carnot be deter
mined, but could be due to allergy, intestinal bacteria, or the intestinal
tract itself. Chronic inflammation may self-perpetuate since loss of the
 mucosal barrier allows more pathogens to enter the mucosal cells, and
further inflammation can result. Several breeds are at increased risk
for IBD, including German shepherd dogs, basenjis, soft-coated
wheaten terriers, and Chinese Shar-Peis.
Vomiting, diarrhea, and weight loss are the common signs of IBD,
and all ages are affected. Vomiting occurs more often in cats with IBD.
Clirical signs usually occur off and on over the course of months to
years.
A dietary elimination trial should be performed to see if food allergy
is the possible cause of IBD. This is discussed in further detail in
Chapter 10, Food Intolerance and Allergy. Briefly, a diet is chosen that
includes a rovel protein source (one that the pet has not previously
observed for clinical improvement.
Dehydration is a frequent problem because of the loss of fhuid with
vomiting. Fluid deficits should be corrected with intravenous or sub-
cutaneous fluid therapy, and fresh water should be available at all
times.
Potassium is lost during vomiting. Thus, a diet for pets with IBD
should insure an adequate supply of potassium (Table 13.6). Diets
should be energy dense, so that a small volume of food can be fed at
each meal, which will help minimize Gl secretions. However, high-fat
diets should be avoided as these can contribute to osmotic diarrhea.

Restriction of dietary fat is the most critical dietary treatment.
Ingested long-chain triglycerides stimulate intestinal lymph flow
within 4-6 hours after a meal. The protein content of lymph increases
as the fat corntent increases. Thus, by limiting the dietary fat (<l0% DM
for dogs and <15% DM for cats; Table 13.7), lymph flow is reduced,
and less protein is lost. Unfortunately, the restricted dietary fat
decreases the energy density of the food, and thus the pet must
consume a large portion of diet to meet energy needs. The addition of
medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) has been suggested, as they par
tially bypass the lymphatic charnels for absorption and do not stimu-
late the flow of lymph. MCTs are 8-10 carbons in length, do not require
bile salts for absorption, and are absorbed faster than long-chain tri-
glycerides. MCT oil is made from coconut oil and does not contain the
essential fatty acids. One tablespoon of MCT oil provides about 115
kcal and can be added to the diet. However, MCT oil is not very palat-
able, and it is expennsive.
High-protein diets are recommended to increase the caloric density.
Multiple small meals are usually fed throughout the day. Fiber is typi-
cally kept to a low level since the addition of fiber decreases the energy
density of the diet. Fat-soluble vitamins may need to be supplemented

if there is long-term fat malabsorption and severe dietary fat restric-

 Short Bowel Syndrome
Short bowel syndrome occurs after a major portion (>70%) of the
small intestine has been removed for other reasons and is uncommon
in dogs and cats. Conditions leading to small intestine resection
include foreign body removal, intestinal intussusception, volvulus,
fungal infections, or neoplasia. German shepherd dogs are most com-
morly affected. Weight loss and diarrhea occur secondary to the
decreased malabsorption of rutrients in the shortened intestine.

intestinal motility. Fat-soluble vitamins may need to be given intra-
muscularly every 3 months, as these are typically malabsorbed.
Vitamin Bi2 absorption will be deficient if the distal ileum has been
removed, and vitamin Bi2 may also need to be supplied via injection
Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth
Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is characterized by an
increase in the number of bacteria present in the small intestine.
Clirical signs include intermittent small intestine diarrhea, flatulence,
and weight loss. Breeds at highest risk include German shepherd dogs.
beagles, Yorkshire terriers, and poodles. Decreased gastric acid secre-
tion, loss of intestinal peristalsis, and intestinal stasis can all lead to
SIBO.
An energy-dense diet should be fed since these pets are typically
underweight. Also, with an energy-dense food, multiple small meals

can be fed throughout the day, which helps to minimize Gl secretions.
The fat content of the diet should be moderate and not high to avoid
further diarrhea. Diets should contain 10%-15% fat DM for dogs and
15%-22% DM for cats.
Large Intestine Disorders
■ Colitis
Colitis is common in dogs and cats and can be caused by a large
rumber of infectious, toxic, inflammatory, and dietary factors. Acute
colitis can be caused by dietary indiscretion, foreign bodies, drugs.
Campylobacter, Clostridium, Salmonella, parasites such as Giardia or
whipworms, panleukopenia, parvovirus, or hemorrhagic gastroenteri-
tis. IBD (discussed previously) is the most common cause of chroric
intestine diarrhea include parasites, Campylobacter, Salmonella, feline
immunodeficiency virus, feline leukemia virus, fungal infections, food
allergy, food intolerance, or neoplasia.
Young animals are more prone to dietary indiscretion and certain
bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections. Older immunocompromised
pets are at higher risk for contracting viral and bacterial infections.
are more likely to be affected. Ulcerative colitis is most common in
boxers and French bulldogs.
Dietary protein should be sufficient for life stage, urless a higher
protein concentration is required due to a protein-losing enteropa-
thy. Novel source proteins may be beneficial (Table 13.9). Fat
content is usually moderate (10%-15% DM for dogs, 15%-22% DM
for cats), but dogs and cats with colitis can often tolerate higher
levels of fat if a greater dietary caloric density is necessary.
Potassium depletion is common with colitis, so diets should contain
more than adequate potassium. Sodium and chloride may also be
low, so these minerals should be adequate in the diet. Dietary fiber
helps to normalize coloric motility, buffers toxins in the Gl tract,
binds water, supports growth of normal intestinal bacterial flora,
and alters the consistency of the contents of the Gl tract. Some veter
inarians have recommended feeding very low-fiber foods, whereas
others have recommended moderate or high-dietary fiber concentra-

 Irritable Bowel Syndrome
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is poorly characterized and may be
caused by a decrease in Gl motility. IBS has not been observed in cats.
Dogs with IBS have intermittent bouts of large intestine-origin diar-
rhea. There may be explosive diarrhea accomparied by abdominal
pain and straining. Stress is typically associated with IBS and can
include the stress of boarding, dog showing, or changes in the environ-
ment. Dogs with a nervous temperament are more prone to develop
ing IBS. Working breeds and toy breeds are more commorly affected.
Many dogs with IBS improve when the dietary fiber is increased.
Crude fiber in the diet should be 10%-15% DM
 Constipation/Megacolon
Constipation refers to absent or infrequent defecation, with reten-
tion of feces in the colon and rectum. Obstipation occurs when the
colon and rectum become impacted with hard, dry feces, and defeca-
tion cannot occur. Megacolon is a condition associated with chroric
constipation in which the colon becomes extremely dilated with
decreased motility. Causes of constipation include painful defecation,
foreign bodies, colon obstruction, neuromuscular disorders, dehydra-
fion, or medications. Megacolon is most common in middle-aged to
older male cats.
 Dietary therapy for constipation and megacolon involves increas-
ing the fiber content of the diet. Increased fiber is beneficial to increase
coloric motility and intestinal transit rate. Flatulence or abdominal

of megacolon, dietary therapy alone is not sufficient, and other medical
 Perianal Fistulas
Perianal fistulas are deep fistulous tracts in the tissue surrounding
the anus. German shepherd dogs and Irish setters are most commonly
affected. The cause is not known but may involve infection of the
glands around the anus and cell-mediated immune mecharisms.
Clinical signs include constant licking of the anal area, scooting, strain-
ing to defecate, and a foul-smelling discharge from the anal area.
Surgical therapy is often necessary.
Dietary therapy is to increase the fiber content of the diet. The fiber
content of the diet is increased by 5% per week to prevent abdominal
discomfort. A novel protein source may be beneficial in some dogs.
Supplemental omega-3 fatty acids may help alleviate some of the
inflammation.
 Flatulence
Flatulence is caused by the production, accumulation, and expul
sion of excess gas in the GI tract. Gas production in the Gl tract is a
normal occurrence, but when this is excessive, excess flatulence is a
result. Most of the components of intestinal gas are odorless, and only
about 1% of gas is composed of odoriferous compounds. The volume
and composition of gas are affected by the types of intestinal bacteria
present, feeding behaviors, and the composition of the diet. Other
signs of excess gas production include borborygmus (growling
stomach/intestines), abdominal discomfort, vomiting, diarrhea, and
weight loss.
Feeding behaviors, such as nervous or greedy eaters, can lead to
           
  a g s ssx  n  a e (
milk products can cause excessive gas production and abdominal
discomfort due to the inability to digest lactose. Diets containing
spoiled fat are also likely to lead to excessive flatulence. A few disease
conditions can also cause excessive flatulence. Malabsorption, intesti-
nal parasites, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, small intestinal bacte
all be medical causes.
174SECTION 1 NUTRITION AND DIETARY MANAGEMENT
To determine the cause of flatulence, a complete physical examina-
tion should be performed, along with fecal examinations to rule out
the presence of intestinal parasites. Any medical condition should be
treated and the pet wormed if indicated. If no medical problems are
detected, then the diet and feeding behavior should be examined. Air
gulping during eating can be managed in a number of ways. Providing
small quantities of food several times per day will help decrease the
 a   s       s e  
other dogs are present, feeding this dog in an isolated area away from
others may help to slow down the ingestion of food and amount of
air consumed. Changing the diet to a high-quality, low-fiber, highly
digestible diet that does not include soybean should result in decreased
gas formation in the GI tract. An increase in exercise promotes increased
expulsion of gas, resulting in less gas being passed while the dog is at
rest.
Management practices are the most effective methods of dealing
with excessive flatulence, but in severe cases, medical therapy may be
indicated. The antifoaming agent simethicone does not reduce the
amount of gas produced, but helps gas to be released easier, prevent-
ing accumulation.

CHAPTER 14
Diet and Chronic Renal Disease
P.A. Schenck
D.J. Chew
Chroric renal failure (CRF) is a common problem in dogs and cats,
and dogs and cats of any age can be diagnosed with CRF. CRF is the
third most common cause of death in dogs and the second leading
cause of death in cats. In a study involving primary care practices,
renal disease in all ages of cats had a prevalence of 2.2% compared to
0.8% in dogs. Increasing age and decreasing body condition score
increase the likelihood for diagnosis of renal disease. In one study of
cats affected with CRF, 37% were less than 10 years old, 31% were
between 10 and 15 years of age, and 32% were greater than 15 years
of age. It appears that old cats develop CRF more frequently than do
dogs of similar age. The prevalence of CRF also increases in aging
 yo s oi o  s u  no a  s ao u so
was 1.3%, 2.4% in dogs between 10 and 15 years old, and 5.7% in dogs
over 15 years of age.
      p as 
progresses to azotemia, which is characterized by elevations in circu-
lating urea ritrogen and creatinine concentrations. Azotemia pro-
gresses to uremia, where there are overt clirical signs. Chroric renal
failure occurs when the compensatory mechanisms of chrorically dis-
eased kidneys are no longer able to maintain adequate functions to
excrete waste products; regulate electrolyte, water, and acid-base
homeostasis; degrade hormones; and synthesize endocrine hormones.
As a result, ritrogenous solutes are retained, there are derangements
181
182
SECTION1NUTRITIONANDDIETARYMANAGEMENT
of fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base balance, and there is failure of
hormone production. Early renal disease can be difficult to diagnose,
as azotemia does not develop until 75% or more of kidney function
has been lost. The ability to concentrate urine is lost when 66% or more
of kidney function has been lost.
The kidney is an important organ with excretory, regulatory, deg-
radative, and endocrine functions. With CRF, there is loss of excretion
of compounds such as urea and creatinine, and derangements in the
reabsorption and excretion of solutes, which can lead to abnormalities
in water, electrolytes, and acid-base balance. Many small peptides
(such as gastrin) are normally filtered by the kidney, reabsorbed, and
degraded in the proximal tubular cells. Loss of this clearance function
can result in metabolic derangements because a number of these small
peptides are hormones. The kidney is also responsible for production
of erythropoietin and calcitriol, so these important hormones are
decreased in CRF.
Acute Renal Failure
With acute renal failure (ARF), the kidneys are sudderly unable to
regulate water balance, with rapid deterioration of renal function. ARF
         i  
include hypotension from shock or heart failure, hemorrhage, severe
dehydration, severe infectiors, obstruction of the ureters or urethra,
ylene glycol (antifreeze), orgaric solvents, heavy metals, pesticides,
leptospirosis, or snake venom. Renal damage associated with ARF
may be reversible if treated promptly and aggressively. Irreversible
progressive renal damage from ARF can lead to CRF.
Causes of Chronic Renal Failure
There are many different causes of CRF in dogs and cats, although a
defiritive cause is often not determined. Chroric tubulointerstitial
nephritis of urknown cause is the most common pathologic diagnosis
for CRF in dogs and cats. Other causes of CRF in dogs include chroric
pyelonephritis, chronic glomerulonephritis, amyloidosis, hypercalce
sis, familial renal disease, progression after ARF, chroric toxicity
(food-associated, drug admiristration, envirormental toxins), neopla-
sia, or primary systemic hypertension. Other causes of CRF in cats
CHAPTER 14 DIET AND CHRONIC RENAL DISEASE

include chroric pyelonephritis, chroric glomerulonephritis, amyloi-
     ) s
hypercalcemic nephropathy, progression after ARF, chroric obstruc-
tive uropathy, neoplasia, pyogranulomatous nephritis due to feline
infectious peritoritis, hypokalemic nephropathy, chroric toxicity, and
primary systemic hypertension.

cats, and some have been shown to be hereditary. The term nephropa-
thy has been used to describe disorganized nephrogenesis; familial
nephropathy is used to describe the occurrence in related individuals,
and hereditary nephropathy is used when a hereditary basis has been
documented.
Familial nephropathy has been observed in cocker spariels,
Norwegian elkhounds, Lhasa apsos, shih tzus, Doberman pinschers,
standard poodles, soft-coated wheaten terriers, bull terriers, Samoyeds,
Bernese mountain dogs, Rottweilers, beagles, golden retrievers, and
chow chows. Hereditary nephropathy has been observed in Samoyeds,
English cocker spariels, and bull terriers. These dogs are affected with

occurs in young Chinese shar-peis, beagles, and Abyssinian cats, and
polycystic kidney disease is familial in Persian cats. Himalayan
Persian, mixed breed, and Siamese cats also appear to be at increased
risk for renal disease or renal failure
Pathophysiology of Chronic Renal Failure
The development of glomerular hyperfiltration and intraglomerular
hypertensior are considered the most important factors in the progres-
sion of CRF. Hyperfiltration increases the movement of protein across
the glomerular capillaries, and this increased filtration of proteins into
the urine (proteinuria) is toxic to the kidneys. In dogs, renal disease
does not become progressive until 85%-95% of the renal mass has been
lost. Cats appear to have a slower progression of renal disease. In
addition, compounds that have decreased excretion during CRF con-
tribute to the clirical signs of uremia. Urea, guaridine compounds,
products of bacterial metabolism, myoinositol, trace elements, para-
thyroid hormone and other hormones, have been considered as
"uremic toxins."

SECTION 1NUTRITION ANDDIETARYMANAGEMENT
Clinical Findings in Chronic Renal Failure
The first abnormalities that may be noticed by owners is an increase
in the urine produced (polyuria) and thirst (polydipsia). Dog owners
may notice this earlier if the dog starts to have accidents in the house,
especially overright. Cat owners may not notice increased urination
until an increase in the weight of the litterbox is observed. Both the
ability to produce concentrated urine (to conserve water) and the
ability to excrete water are impaired in CRF. Impairment of concen-
trating ability develops when about 67% of the kidney is not func-
tional; however, some

with CRF than in cats. Vomiting may be stimulated by the presence
of uremic toxins. Gastroenteritis with hemorrhage or gastrointestinal
ulcers may result due to increased gastrin concentrations. Diarrhea is
relatively uncommon, but may occur late in CRF. Anorexia is common
due to the effects of uremic toxins on the brain and also due to oral
bone loss in the jaw. Weight loss is due to the lack of adequate intake
and to increased catabolic processes. The haircoat may be dull and
dry. Lean muscle mass is often lost in CRF, most likely due to the
breakdown of proteins and enhances branched-chain amino acid
catabolism. Uremic encephalopathy may occur when the glomerular
filtration rate decreases to less than 10% of normal. Clirical signs of
uremic encephalopathy include facial twitching, head bobbing, abnor-
mal behavior, tremors, and seizures. Calcium influx in the brain medi-
ated by high parathyroid (PTH) concentrations may play a role in
uremic encephalopathy of CRF. Amino acid alterations due to malnu-
trition or accumulation of uremic toxins may alter neurotransmitter
function. Low serum ionized calcium concentrations, systemic hyper
tension, or aluminum accumulation in the brain may also contribute
to the clinical signs.
Oral lesions are more common in dogs than in cats with CRF. There
may be a foul oral odor due to accumulation of ammoria and aliphatic
amines, and erosions and ulcers of the mouth and tongue may be due
to excretion of urea into saliva and breakdown to ammoria by oral
bacteria. Tongue tip necrosis may occur as the result of a poor blood
supply to the tongue, and the gums may be pale due to anemia.
Dehydration is a common finding in CRF due to the increased fluid
loss in urine and from the gastrointestinal tract (vomit), coupled with
CHAPTER 14 DIET AND CHRONIC RENAL DISEASE
185
a lack of fluid intake. There is a loss of skin elasticity, and the gums
appear dry Heart murmurs and abnormal rhythms are relatively
common as a consequence of systemic hypertension and anemia. On
abdominal palpation, the kidneys are usually small, hard, and irregu-
in cats. Edema or ascites suggests a severe loss of plasma proteins. A
loss of bone mass (fibrous osteodystrophy) is most dramatic in young
teeth appear loose or may be lost, and the jaw may actually feel
rubbery. Blindness can be observed if there are retinal lesions from
systemic hypertension. There may also be hemostasis defects and a
predisposition to hemorrhage.
Laboratory Findings in Chronic Renal Failure
Results of a complete blood cell count (CBC) demonstrate that norre
generative anemia is common in CRF but variable in severity. The
severity of the anemia is roughly correlated to the severity of the CRF
as judged by serum creatinine concentration. The primary cause of
anemia in CRF is a decrease in the production of erythropoietin (EPO)
by the damaged kidneys. Erythropoietin stimulates the final differen-
cells, and with a lack of EPO, mature red blood cells are produced at
a much slower rate. The life span of red cells in uremic patients is
approximately 50% that of healthy individuals. The decreased life
span is thought to be due to a toxic factor (possibly PTH) that pro-
         
blood cell production. An increase in neutrophils and a decrease in
lymphocytes may be seen due to the stress of chroric disease. Platelet
rumbers may be normal, but platelet function is abnormal.
Results of the serum biochemistry profle show that both serum
urea ritrogen and creatirine concentrations are elevated in CRF. In
arimals with substantial muscle wasting, the serum creatirine concer
tration may rot reflect the severity of CRF. Serum sodium is normal
in most patients with CRF, although it may be elevated if dehydration
is present. Most arimals have normal serum potassium concentra-

186
SECTION 1 NUTRITION AND DIETARY MANAGEMENT
potassium can exist without the development of hypokalemia.
Hypokalemic nephropathy is a specific syndrome in cats as a result of
CRF or as a cause of CRF. In the early stages of CRF, the serum phos.
phorus concentration is often rormal due to the corrective effect of
renal secondary hyperparathyroidism. Hyperphosphatemia develops
with advancing CRF when 85% or more of the kidneys become
nonfunctional.
Serum total calcium concentration is normal in most patients with
pretation of calcium status occur wher serum total calcium is mea-
sured. Analysis of the iorized calcium concentration is required for an
accurate assessment of calcium status. The "mass law" effect decreases
serum calcium as a consequence of increased serum phosphorus con-
centration. The amounts of calcium and phosphorus that can remain
in solution together are defined by the calcium multiplied by phos-
phorus product. Decreased production of calcitriol also results in
impaired intestinal absorption of calcium, lowering the circulating
calcium concentration. Hypocalcemia in CRF is usually asymptomatic
because metabolic acidosis leads to an increase in the ionized calcium
    s    s  
hypercalcemia, which may further damage the kidneys by causing
mineralization, especially if the phosphorus is elevated.
Metabolic acidosis is common in patients with CRF. Metabolic aci-
dosis has been documented in 53% of cats with advanced CRF, but in
only 15% of cats with mild CRF. The main cause of metabolic acidosis
is limitation of renal ammorium excretion. When the glomerular filtra
tion rate falls to 10%-20% of normal, the diseased kidneys carnot
excrete ammoria adequately and acidosis occurs.
Urinalysis demorstrates that arimals fail to concentrate their urine
when 67% of the kidneys become nonfunctional. An increase in protein
in the urine suggests an increased severity of disease and progression
OfCRF.
Systemic Hypertension
The prevalence of systemic hypertension in dogs with CRF ranges
from 9% to 93% ard from 19% to 65% in cats with CRF. About 20%-

factor for the progression of CRF in humans and rats, and recent evi-
dence suggests that this is also true for dogs and cats with CRF. It is
CHAPTER 14 DIET AND CHRONIC RENAL DISEASE
187
likely that high systemic blood pressure is transmitted to the glomeru
lar vessels, which promotes further injury to the kidneys.
A clirical study of dogs with CRF showed that dogs with systemic
hypertension at the time of diagnosis progressively lost renal function
pressure. Those in the high blood pressure group had three times an
increased risk for uremic crisis than dogs in lower blood pressure
groups and had much greater risk for renal-related death. The correla-
tion of urregulated hypertension to the progression of CRF has not
been established in cats. Cats that have systemic hypertension from a
variety of causes have been shown to survive longest when their blood
pressure is well controlled.
Patients with systolic blood pressure readings consistently above
170mm Hg or those with abnormally high blood pressure readings
that also have eye lesions consistent with hypertensive retinopathy
(e.g., retinal edema, intraretinal serous exudation, retinal hemor
rhages, arterial tortuosity, retinal detachment) are candidates for anti
        
effective treatment for severe hypertension. Therapy using ACE inhib-
itors (ACE-l: enalapril, benazepril), calcium charnel blockers (amlo-
dipine), beta adrenergic antagonists (atenolol, propranolol), or alpha-1
adrenergic antagorists (prazosin) are used to lower blood pressure.
Renal Secondary Hyperparathyroidism
hormone (PTH) syrthesis and secretion become excessive as a result
of kidney disease. Excess PTH is a major uremic toxin and exerts
adverse effects on the brain, heart, bone marrow, and other tissues.
Increased secretion of PTH by each parathyroid cell, as well as
increased numbers of cells due to parathyroid hyperplasia, leads
to increased circulating PTH. Insufficient production of calcitriol in
uremic patients is the most important factor leading to the uncon-
trolled secretion of PTH. The major effects of calcitriol are to increase
the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate and to increase
bone resorption, thereby increasing the serum iorized calcium concen-
tration. In renal disease, there are fewer healthy proximal tubule cells
containing the mitochondrial 1o-hydroxylase enzyme necessary to
form calcitriol from the precursor 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Nephron loss
during CRFis estimated most commorly by the magritude ofincreased
serum creatinine. An association of increasing serum creatinine with
dimirished serum calcitriol in dogs has been shown. Decreased blood
188SECTION1NUTRITIONANDDIETARYMANAGEMENT
calcitriol lowers intestinal calcium absorption, leading to hypocalce
mia. As the serum iorized calcium concentration falls, the secretion of
PTH is stimulated. In early CRF, the increased PTH concentration can
restore calcitriol production and iorized calcium concentrations when
there are still enough proximal tubular cells remaining that are capable
of calcitriol synthesis.
As glomerular filtration rate is further reduced in late chroric renal
failure, greater increases of serum phosphorus occur, mass law inter-
actions contribute to a decrease of ionized calcium, and further PTH
production is stimulated. A greater reduction in the activity of the
lo-hydroxylase responsible for calcitriol synthesis occurs as a conse-
quence of the markedly increased serum phosphorus. In addition, the
absolute loss of most of the proximal tubular cells makes adequate
synthesis of calcitriol no longer possible. At this point, the markedly
elevated PTH concentration is no longer able to restore calcitriol con-
centrations to normal. The ionized calcium concentration decreases,
stimulating further increases in PTH production. The excess PTH
causes continual reabsorption of bone, especially in the face, leading
to severe bone loss in the jaw (rubber jaw).Treatment with oral cal-
citriol is recommended to decrease the PTH levels and to return the
serum iorized calcium concentration to normal.
Treatment of Chronic Renal Failure
The goals in treating CRF are to mirimize the clirical sigrs of uremia,
retard the progressive loss of renal function, and to preserve the nutri-
tional status of the pet. Any potentially reversible causes of renal
disease (such as pyelonephritis, hypercalcemia, or obstructive
nephropathy) should be treated, and concurrent systemic or urinary
tract bacterial infections should be treated with the appropriate anti
biotics. Extensive therapy is recommended to manage fluid balance,
to control vomiting and inappetence, to provide hormone replacement
(erythropoietin and calcitriol), and to control proteinuria and hyper
tension. In addition to medical therapies, dietary management is criti-
cal in the freatment of chroric renal failure.
 Dietary Management
"Renal-friendly" diets are generally restricted in protein, phospho-
rus, calcium, and sodium. Compared to the average grocery or pet
store foods, renal-friendly diets are restricted in protein by about

should provide adequate nutrient intake to allow a good quality of life
with reasonable body condition. Food intake and body condition com
morly deteriorate during CRF and may result from physical changes

access to water should be provided at all times to prevent dehydration
in the pet with polyuria and CRF.

tion rate is better maintained, and survival time is longer.
When CRF is diagnosed, phosphorus restriction is initiated by
feeding a low-phosphorus diet (Table 14.1). Dietary phosphorus

were over twice that of those eating maintenance diets: this effect was
attributed to phosphorus control and control of PTH. Renal diets may
provide sufficient dietary phosphate restriction during early stages of
CRF, but often dietary phosphate binders are needed. Phosphorus-
binding agents should be given with meals or within 2 hours of feeding

oral phosphorus binders include aluminum hydroxide, calcium car
bonate, and calcium acetate.
Two nutritional supplements designed to limit intestinal phosphate
absorption have been approved for use in cats in some countries.
Epakitin (Vetoquinol, Buena, NJ) contains chitosan and calcium car-
bonate to provide intestinal phosphate binding for cats. One small

this product to limit intestinal phosphate absorption from mainte-
nance diets and from veterinary renal diets in both normal cats and
those with reduced renal function.
Return of serum phosphorus to normal does not guarantee that
PTH levels will return to rormal, as phosphorus restriction works orly
in those that have enough active tubular machinery capable of cal-
removed. Return of serum phosphorus to within the normal range is
an initial goal, but achieving concentrations in the lower to midrange
for normal serum phosphorus provides additional benefits in control

Protein
Although widely advocated, the ability of dietary protein restric-
tion to ameliorate clinical signs in dogs and cats with CRF remains
unclear. Potential benefits would be obtained by decreasing the pro
duction of toxic metabolites of protein metabolism in patients with

amount of protein is catabolized after every meal regardless of the
amount of protein ingested. Cats also require higher levels of arginine
and taurine. Cats syrthesize orly a small amount of taurine and carnot
use glycine for bile acid conjugation if taurine is restricted. Thus, a
source of taurine from arimal sources is necessary in the diet to replace
taurine loss. For these reasons, it is easier for cats to develop protein-
calorie malnutrition as compared to dogs. Protein restriction should
be considered when moderate to severe azotemia persists in the well
hydrated state. There must be a balance between reducing protein
intake and the animal's willingness to eat. Maintenance of stable body
weight and serum albumin concentration suggests adequate intake of
calories and protein, whereas progressive declines in body weight and

omega-6 PUFA in the diet decreases production of the proinflamma-

increases production of vasodilatory prostaglandins (PGE, PGl), which
have the potential to increase renal blood flow and glomerular filtra-
tion rate. These effects may slow the progression of CRF. Studies in
dogs have demonstrated beneficial effects of omega-3 PUFA supple-

Potassium
Excessive serum potassium is usually not a problem in CRF, as
the kidneys can maintain normal serum potassium concentrations

even when the glomerular filtration rate is about 5% of normal.
Cats with CRF are prone to disorders of potassium homeostasis,
resulting in a decrease in circulating potassium (hypokalemia)
Potassium supplementation is indicated if hypokalemia is observed.
Dietary potassium should be provided at adequate but not excessive
levels.
Vitamins
Excess serum vitamin A concentrations are common in people with
renal failure, and serum creatinine concentrations appear to correlate
with vitamin A concentrations. Toxicity is uncommon though, because
most of the vitamin A is bound to retinol-binding protein and is inac-
tive. Little is known regarding vitamin A concentrations in dogs and
cats with renal failure, thus no dietary recommendations have been
made.
 There is an increased risk for deficiency of B vitamins in renal
failure, due to decreased intake and loss in vomit, diarrhea, and urine.
Deficiency of some of the B vitamins may be linked to the anorexia
seen in renal failure. Vitamins should be supplied in adequate quanti-
ties in the diet.

Diet and Urinary Tract Stones
P.A. Schenck
D.J. Chew
Urinary tract stones (uroliths) are a relatively common problem in
dogs and cats. The most common uroliths in dogs are struvite, oxalate,
purine (urate and xanthine), cystine, and silicates. The most common
uroliths in cats are struvite and oxalate.
A urolith is an organized concretion found in the urinary tract.
When the solubility product of a solute is exceeded, crystals form,
aggregate, and grow. Crystals must reside in the urinary tract for a
sufficient period of time to allow a urolith to form. Diet, water intake,
urire volume, urine concertration, urine pH, metabolic abnormalities,
envirorment, and genetics all contribute to stone formation. Most
uroliths have one major component. Crystals can be present in urine
(crystalluria) when uroliths are not, and crystals may be absent in
 ss  s       
fresh urine sediment are a risk factor for recurrence of stone formation
in those animals that have previously formed a urolith.
Some uroliths are large and remain in the bladder. Some uroliths
are small enough to pass into the urethra and cause obstruction. Signs
of uroliths include straining to urinate, frequent urination, urinary
incontinence, and blood in the urine (hematuria). Uroliths can be
 present in the bladder for long periods of time before any clinical signs
are present.
Quantitative stone analysis is essential for accurate identification of
the uroliths presert. Small stones may be aspirated from the bladder

through a urinary catheter; surgical removal of stones from the bladder
(cystotomy) may be necessary if the uroliths are large. Radiographs or
ultrasound of the urinary tract should be performed to ensure that all

a catheter.
General Treatment of Urolithiasis
The frequency of urolithiasis in dogs or cats is not high enough to
justify dietary modification before a urolith forms, and treatment of
crystalluria is urnecessary in dogs that have never formed a urolith.
Iritial therapy of urolithiasis is to either remove or dissolve the urolith,
followed by therapy to decrease the risk of recurrence. Specific treat-
ment recommendations are based on the type of urolith present.
Any arimal that has formed a urolith is at increased risk for recur
rence. Water is the most important nutrient in preverting recurrence.
Increasing water intake to dilute urine and increase the frequency of
         
should be kept near 1.020 in dogs, and less than 1.030 in cats. A specific
diet should be chosen that provides less precursor minerals for excre-
tion and results in a favorable urinary pH to keep crystals in solution.
Medical dissolution protocols are available for struvite, urates, and
cystine uroliths. There are no protocols available for dissolution of
calcium oxalate uroliths; thus, these must be removed either by cath-
eterization or surgery. Successful dissolution should be confirmed by
radiographs or ultrasound. Periodic evaluation of the urine should be
performed to make sure that there is no urinary infection and to assess
the urine specific gravity. There should be few crystals present; if large
numbers of crystals are present, then there needs to be a change in
therapy.
Struvite Urolithiasis in Dogs
Struvite (magnesium ammorium phosphate hexahydrate) is the most
common urolith type and accounts for about 50% of uroliths in dogs.

Most struvite uroliths are associated with a urinary tract infection
(UTl). Struvite urolithiasis is most common in female dogs between 2
and 9 years of age. The miniature schnauzer, Shih tzu, bichon frise,

Urinary tract infection usually precedes the development of struvite
uroliths. Hydrolysis of urea by bacteria leads to increased generation
of ammoria and carbon dioxide into the urine, which results in an
increase in urinary pH. Increased availability of ammorium and phos
phate ions results, which cortributes to struvite formatior. The solu-
bility of struvite is markedly reduced in the alkaline urine. Failure to
eliminate or prevent UTl is the main reason why struvite uroliths
recur.
Diets designed for dissolution of struvite uroliths in dogs are
severely protein-restricted, phosphate-restricted, and magnesium-
restricted (Table 15.1). These diets also produce highly acidic urine.
The severe protein restriction is designed to reduce urea generation;
therefore, less urinary urea is available as a substrate for urease-pro-
ducing bacteria in the urine. Mineral restriction reduces the urinary
minerals available to form struvite uroliths.
Caution should be exercised when feeding these diets. Since these
diets are very restricted in protein, they may decrease serum proteins,
which affects fluid balance, and should not be used in dogs with heart
failure, renal failure, or hypertension. Also, since these diets are typi-
cally high in fat, they should be used with caution in patients at risk
for pancreatitis. Breeds at risk for pancreatitis (miriature schnauzers.
bichon frises, Yorkshire terriers, Chihuahuas, Jack Russell terriers,
Japanese spariels, Labrador retrievers, Maltese, and Shetland sheep-
dogs) should be evaluated for pancreatitis before and during dietary
therapy. Because of the protein and mineral restriction, these diets
should only be fed when necessary, and they should not be fed long
term.

UTI (excessive perivulvar skin folds, incontinence, hyperadrenocorti-
cism, etc.) should be treated.
Calcium Oxalate Urolithiasis in Dogs
Calcium oxalate monohydrate and dihydrate stones account for about
30% of uroliths in dogs, and the incidence has increased in recent
years. Calcium oxalate uroliths may be single or multiple and are
visible on radiographs. The dehydrate form is often spicular, with
sharp, jagged edges, and the monohydrate form is usually small,
smooth, and round. Breeds at increased risk for calcium oxalate uro-
liths are miniature schnauzers, standard schnauzers, Lhasa apso,
Yorkshire terrier, bichon frises, shih tzu, and miniature poodles.
Breeds at decreased risk for development of calcium oxalate uroliths
include German shepherds, golden retrievers, and cocker spaniels.
Affected dogs are typically male and between 8 and 12 years of age,
 e ae sp rao s ea go a aa 1e 
An increase in serum calcium (hypercalcemia) has been detected in
about 4% of dogs with calcium oxalate uroliths. Urinary tract infection
is not typical in dogs with calcium oxalate uroliths. Calcium oxalate
uroliths are relatively slow growing, and the recurrence rate is from
25%t0 48%
Supersaturation with calcium and oxalate in urine is required for
calcium oxalate uroliths to form. Acidic urine is common in dogs with
calcium oxalate uroliths and reflects systemic acid-base balance. The
chroric feeding of an acidifying diet may cause leaching of calcium
from bones as a buffering response, and this excess calcium is filtered
by the kidneys, resulting in excess calcium excreted in urine (hyper-
calciuria). Hypercalciuria is a risk factor for calcium urolith
formation.
Calcium oxalate uroliths need to be removed surgically or via cath-
eterization. Dogs with concurrent hypercalcemia should be evaluated

calcium in the urine. Whether dietary calcium should be restricted is
debated. High-calcium diets can result in decreased absorption of
dietary calcium and oxalate. In addition, low calcium intake could
cause an upregulation of calcitriol production, resulting in an increase
in urinary calcium. Foods high in oxalates should be avoided (Table
15.3), and vitamin C should not be given as a supplement, as vitamin
C can be converted to oxalates. The desired pH of the urine is about
7.0 and should be measured using a pH meter, not urinary dip strips.
If diet does not sufficiently raise the urine pH, potassium citrate is
added to the treatment regimenl.
Urate Urolithiasis
Purine stones (urates and xanthin) account for about 8% of urinary
  pso nsn a sn n 'sop  sso n s
monobasic ammorium salt of uric acid (ammorium acid urate). Urate
uroliths are small, brittle, spherical stones with concentric laminations.
They are usually multiple in number and light yellow, brown, or green
in color. They are most often found in the bladder and urethra. They
usually form in urine that is neutral to acidic. Urate troliths are not
often seen on radiographs, and special procedures such as contrast
radiography or ultrasound are usually required.
Urate uroliths are most common in Dalmatians and English bull
dogs; other breeds affected include miriature schnauzers, Yorkshire
terriers, and shih tzus. Males are more commonly affected because the
small uroliths become lodged in the urethra, leading to signs of urinary
tract obstruction. Urate stones usually occur in dogs between l and 4
years of age, and the risk of urate urolith formation greatly decreases
after 5 years of age. The recurrence rate for urate uroliths is high
(33%-50%)

Urate uroliths are often found in dogs with portosystemic shunts,
possibly due to reduced conversion of ammonia to urea and uric acid
to allantoin. A defect in uric acid metabolism in the Dalmatian is a
predisposing factor for urate urolithiasis. Uric acid is derived from the
metabolic degradation of purines. In dogs other than Dalmatians, uric
acid is converted to allantoin in the liver by the enzyme uricase.
Dalmatian dogs have higher plasma uric acid concentrations and
excrete much more uric acid in their urine than do other dogs. Impaired
transport of uric acid into liver cells may reduce the rate of hepatic
 oxidation in Dalmatians. The proximal tubules of Dalmatians appear
to reabsorb less and secrete more urate than do the kidneys of non-
Dalmatian dogs. Many Dalmatian puppies have abundant urate crys-
talluria, although most will not develop urate urolithiasis. There is no

suitable method to predict which Dalmatians with urate crystalluria
will develop clirical signs of urolithiasis and which will not.
A reduced intake of dietary purines and other purine precursors
(diets low in organ-derived meats, especially) is recommended to
reduce the risk for recurrence of urate urolithiasis (Table 15.4). The
solubility of ammorium urate is greater in less-acid urine, thus diets
that generate more alkaline urine are recommended. The protein
content of these diets is low, and they should not be fed to growing
dogs or pregnant or lactating bitches. These low-purine diets should
also not be fed to English bulldogs due to the potential risk of the
development of dilated cardiomyopathy. English bulldogs with
        s 
carnitine, and the carritine deficiency may contribute to dilated
cardiomyopathy.
Allopurinol can be used as a treatment to help dissolve or prevent
the recurrence of urate stones. Allopurinol is a competitive inhibitor
of the enzyme xanthine oxidase, which converts hypoxanthine to
xanthin and xanthine to uric acid in purine metabolism. Thus, allopu-
rinol reduces the amount of uric acid generated. Dogs receiving allo-
purinol should be fed low-purine diets because feeding a diet high in
purine with allopurinol increases the risk for development of xanthine
stones. UTI is a common complication of urate urolithiasis, and can
occur in a third of affected dogs.
Cystine Urolithiasis
Cystine stones account for about 1% of all urinary stones in dogs.
Cystine uroliths have been reported in English bulldogs,
Newfoundlands, dachshunds, Irish terriers, basset hounds, and bull-
mastiffs. Male dogs are typically affected, but both male and female
Newfoundlands can be affected. Cystine stones usually develop in
dogs about 4-6 years of age.

    (     
of renal tubular transport, and the presence of cystine in the urine is
a predisposing factor for cystine uroliths. Cystine stones are small,
spherical, and light yellow, brown, or green in color. Cystine crystals
have a characteristic hexagonal shape. Multiple uroliths are usually
present, and the recurrence rate may be as high as 75%. UTI is usually
a complicationl.
Drugs used to treat cystine stones include D-pericillamine, or
 2-mercaptopropionylglycine (2-MPG). A small number of dogs treated
with 2-MPG may develop aggression as a side effect. A low-protein
diet may result in lower urine specific gravity and increased urine pH
(Table 15.4) and may help to prevent recurrence.
Silicate Urolithiasis
Silicate stones account for about 1% of all urinary stones in dogs
Silicate stones are gray-white or browrish and usually multiple in
number. They frequently have a jack-like appearance, and should be
determined, but diets high in corn gluten or soybean are suspected to
contribute. There is no obvious relationship between silica urolithiasis
and urine pH. Diets high in plant proteins (soybean) may predispose
to recurrence and should be avoided
Urolithiasis in Cats
The term feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD) encompasses a
number of conditions. The incidence is unknown, but is estimated to
be about 1%, based on the presence of clinical signs. Clirical signs of
FLUTD include blood in the urine, urination outside of the litter box,
straining to urinate, increased frequency of urination, or urinary block-
          
urinary stones in cats are struvite and calcium oxalate. Prior to the late
1980s, sterile struvite was the most common urolith found in cats. The
proportion of struvite urolithiasis declined in subsequent years fol-
lowing changes in commercial cat food formulations. Unfortunately
the decline of struvite stones is associated with an increase in the
number of calcium oxalate stones.
The frequency of urolithiasis does not appear to be greater in cats

tion of the first stone. Treatment of sporadic calcium oxalate or struvite
crystalluria is not necessary in cats that have never formed a stone
previously. However, all cats that have formed a stone are at increased
risk for recurrence. Water is the most important nutrient to prevent
recurrence of stone formation. Increased water intake will dilute the
urine and increase the frequency of urination. Urine specific gravity
should be approximately 1.030. Decreasing the concentration of poten-
fial stone-forming minerals in the urine and increasing the voiding
frequency are primary therapies to reduce the risk of new stone
formation.
Struvite Urolithiasis in Cats
Urlike dogs, most cats with struvite uroliths do not have UTl. Neutered
cats are 3.5 times more likely to develop struvite uroliths as compared
to sexually intact cats. Most cats develop struvite uroliths between 4
and 7 years of age, and breeds at risk include foreign shorthair, ragdoll,
Chartreux, oriental shorthair, domestic shorthair, and Himalayan. The
rex, Burmese, Abyssirian, Russian blue, Birman, Siamese, and mixed
breed cats have a significantly lower risk of developing struvite
uroliths.
Excess dietary protein should be avoided with struvite urolithiasis
and should be restricted to 30%-45% DM (Table 15.5). Struvite stones
can be dissolved over several weeks using a magnesium-restricted,
acidifying, wet diet. Although magnesium-restricted acidifying diets
are commorly employed to prevent recurrence of sterile struvite
stones in cats, no data have demonstrated their effectiveness.
Calcium Oxalate Urolithiasis in Cats
Consumption of urine-acidifying diets and indoor housing are inde
pendert risk factors for calcium oxalate urolithiasis. Breeds at risk for
calcium oxalate uroliths include ragdoll, British shorthair, foreign
shorthair, Himalayan, Havana brown, Scottish fold, Persian, and
exotic shorthair cats. The Birman, mixed breed, Abyssirian, and
Siamese cats have sigrificantly lower risks for developing calcium
oxalate uroliths. Calcium oxalate stones usually form in cats between
7 and 10 years of age, and male cats and neutered cats are at much
higher risk. About one-third of cats with calcium oxalate stones have
idiopathic hypercalcemia as an association. Nephroliths from cat
kidneys are most likely to be calcium oxalate.

No medical regimen has been shown to successfully dissolve

The frequency of recurrent calcium oxalate stone formation in cats is
unknown. Although a decreased risk of recurrence of oxalate stones
related to diet change has not been documented in cats, changing to
a diet that is less acidifying and that has not been magnesium-restricted
seems reasonable, as long as the resulting urine specific gravity is less
than 1.030 (Table 15.5). Acidifying agents are contraindicated in cats
with calcium oxalate urolithiasis. Foods high in oxalate content should
not be used (Table 15.3).

CHAPTER 16
Diet and Skin Disease
The skin is the largest organ and serves as a barrier between the pet
and the envirorment. Skin is important in protecting against water
loss and comprises about 14% of adult body weight in dogs. The skin
    e i    g
provide insulation. The growth rate of hair varies by breed, season,
length of hair, and region of the body. Hair follicles can be in many
different stages of hair-growth cycle at any time. The growing period
is termed anagen, the resting period is telogen, and the transitional
period is catagen. Hair growth rate is usually fastest during the summer
and slowest in the winter, as growth rate responds mostly to the
amount of daylight.
Dogs with long hair use more protein to maintain hair growth than
 inoqe asn A y on ym shop s q qs qim shop op
of the dietary protein just to maintain hair growth compared to a large
breed dog with a short hair coat that may only need about 10% of
dietary protein for hair growth.
Normal skin slowly replerishes itself, with orly about 1.5% of skin
cels replicating at any given time. Actively growing hair rapidly
renews itself, with about 24% of cells replicating.
Hair contains about 65%-95% protein, and the water content is
dependent on the humidity. Hair has a low mineral content, and
analysis of the hair is not very useful for the determination of nutri-
tional deficiencies.
Skin disorders are common in small arimals, with about 25% of
veterinary visits dealing with the diagnosis of skin and hair coat
problems. The most common skin disorders of the dog and cat are

listed in Table 16.1. Other than adverse reactions to food, skin dis-
eases due to nutritional deficiencies are uncommon. Most skin dis-
eases due to nutritional deficiencies occur in yourg, growing animals
or in females during reproduction or lactation, as these are the stages
in which nutrient requirements are highest. Changes in the hair or
skin suggesting nutritional problems may include a dry, brittle, dull
coat, with hair that falls out easily; slow regrowth of hair from areas
that have been clipped; scale accumulation on the skin; loss of hair in
areas of friction; poor wound healing: or changes in normal hair
color.
For diagnosis, a routine complete blood count (CBC), serum bio-
chemistry profile, urinalysis, and thyroid profile should be performed
to help identify the presence of any other underlying disease. In addi-
tion, skin scrapings for parasites, bacterial and fungal cultures, skin
biopsy, and examination of the hair may be performed. With nutri-
tional deficiencies, examination of hair and examination of the skin
biopsy tissues are usually the most helpful diagnostic tools. Hair that
is malformed suggests nutritional or metabolic diseases. Hair with a
normal shaft that is clearly broken suggests external trauma (licking.
scratching, or grooming).
CHAPTER 16 DIET AND SKIN DISEASE
209
Protein and Energy Deficiency
For hair growth to occur, adequate protein and energy intake are
required. Hair growth requires sulfur-containing amino acids, and
dietary protein sources should be of high quality and be highly digest-
ible. This is most important during growth, reproduction, and lacta-
tion, when nutrient requirements are highest. During protein
deficiency, hair may not form correctly, there may be depigmentation
of hair, and there are changes in skin lipids. The protective barrier of
the skin is altered, and this can lead to secondary bacterial infections
or impaired wound healing. These pets typically have dry, brittle hair
coats, with patchy hair loss. Hair can be lost during the growth phase
(anagen) or during the resting phase (telogen). Hair in telogen is
usually lost when a stressful event occurs (illness, surgery, etc.). Hair
loss in anagen is sudden, and coincides typically with the use of a
drug, infectious disease, or metabolic disease. Dogs with primary seb-

disorders are listed in Table 16.2.
Migratory necrolytic erythema (hepatocutaneous syndrome) is a
severe skin disorder due to an amino acid deficiency. Migratory necro-
lytic erythema is usually the result of chroric liver disease or a pan-
breed and is usually seen in older arimals. Lesions are seen around

Fatty Acid Deficiency
A dietary supply of the essential fatty acids is very important for
maintenance of a healthy skin and coat. The skin lacks certain erzymes
chain fatty acids, thus fatty acids must be supplied in the diet and

those with seborrhea. Dogs with seborrhea can have low levels of
linoleic acids in their skin even though the dietary source and serum
may be beneficial in those with seborrhea. Dry skin and dull coat in
general may also benefit from supplementation with polyunsaturated
fatty acid (PUFA) found in vegetable oils.
Mineral Deficiencies
Copper is an important mineral and is a cofactor for many enzymes
in the body. Clirical signs of copper deficiency include a dull, rough
hair coat, thinning of hair, and loss of normal hair coloration. The loss
of hair color usually starts on the face and gradually extends to the

poultry, beef, and sheep liver.
Zinc is also an important cofactor in many enzymatic reactions.
Zinc deficiency has been characterized in many arimal species. Skin
lesions associated with zinc deficiency include loss of hair, ulceration,
inflammation of the skin, and the development of crusty lesions, espe-
cially of the footpads, areas over joints, and around the mouth and
eyes, the lower extremities, tail, armpits and groin, and ear canals. Zinc
deficiency may also decrease the absorption of essential fatty acids.

bran), which chelates zinc. It can also result from diets that contain

Zinc malabsorption occurs primarily in Nordic breeds (Siberian
husky, Alaskan malamutes), but it can also occur in other breeds such
as Great Danes, bull terriers, German shepherd dogs, and Boston ter-
riers. These breeds typically develop clirical signs in early adulthood.
Ireatment involves zinc supplementation, and there is tsually clirical
improvement in less than 1 month. Treatment is lifelong.
Lethal acrodermatitis is an inherited disorder of bull terriers and is
associated with defects in zinc absorption and metabolism. Clirical
signs of zinc deficiency are present from about 2 weeks of age, and
bronchopneumonia, bone abnormalities, cataracts, and gastroenteritis
also occur. The disease is fatal
Vitamin Deficiencies
Vitamin A is important for skin cell growth, reproduction, and vision
Sources of dietary vitamin A include vitamin A palmitate (retinyl
esters) found in arimal tissues and β-carotene from vegetable sources.
Cats, however, require vitamin A from arimal sources, since cats
carnot convert β-carotene to vitamin A. The term retinoid refers to the
group of vitamin A compounds.
 Skin has a specific receptor for retinoic acid, and deficiency results
 so s s  si a o s p s 
cats consume adequate vitamin A. Retinoids have been used to treat
a number of skin disorders, including disorders of skin keratirization
or sebaceous gland abnormalities. Vitamin A-responsive dermatosis
has been recogrized primarily in cocker spariels but also in Labrador
retrievers and miriature schnauzers. Clirical signs appear in adults
and include refractory seborrhea with plaques, primarily on the
ears and a poor hair coat are usually present. Dogs with this derma-
tosis respond within 3 to 4 weeks after starting oral vitamin A sup-
plementation. Vitamin A supplementation should orly be initiated
when necessary. Side effects can occur and include an increase in
serum calcium (hypercalcemia), conjunctivifis, an increase in serum
triglycerides, decreased tear production, and an increase in liver
enzymes.

oxidant, especially when a higher concentration of polyunsaturated
fatty acids is fed. Vitamin E deficiency has only been reported in cats
that are consuming large quantities of highly unsaturated fatty acids
(such as in red meat tuna). Clirical signs include fever, loss of appetite,
anemia, an increase in white blood cells, and firm subcutaneous
nodules. Treatment involves providing adequate dietary vitamin E
and providing a balanced diet.
Even though not caused by a vitamin E deficiency, a number of skin
disorders havebeen treated with supplemental vitamin E. Inflammatory
disorders that may respond to supplemental vitamin E include discoid
Or systemic lupus erythematosus, pemphigus erythematosus, pan-
riculitis, acanthosis rigricans, dermatomyositis, and ear margin vas-
culitis. Vitamin E may help stabilize membranes and protect them
against damage from free radicals.
Deficiencies of B vitamins such as biotin, riboflavin, riacin, and
pyridoxine can result in loss of appetite, weight loss, diarrhea, loss
of hair, and dry, flaky skin. Clinical signs occur more commonly
in young, growing animals. B vitamins are important cofactors in
fatty acid metabolism. A deficiency of B vitamins can occur in
pets eating homemade diets that are not supplemented with
vitamins.

CHAPTER 17
Diet and Endocrine Disease
Thyroid Disorders
 Hypothyroidism
Hypothyroidism is the most common endocrine disorder in dogs,
but is uncommon in cats. Clirical signs of hypothyroidism include
weight gain, obesity, lethargy, cold intolerance, lack of tear produc-
tion, poor hair coat, hair loss, and mental dullness. Hypothyroidism
can be due to congerital lack of thyroid hormone production (uncom-
mon) or due to destruction of the thyroid glands (common). Diagnosis
is made by identifying low serum thyroid hormone concentrations
with an elevation of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Medical
treatment involves replacement therapy with thyroxine. Dietary man-
is associated with lipid metabolism disorders, feeding a low-fat diet
may be beneficial.
 Hyperthyroidism
Hyperthyroidism is the most common endocrine disorder in the
cat, but is rare in dogs. In the cat, hyperthyroidism is due to a berign
tumor in the thyroid gland (thyroid adenoma); thyroid carcinomas
(cancer) are rare in the cat. Most cats with hyperthyroidism are over
10 years of age. Clirical signs include weight loss, an increase in
appetite, a palpable thyroid tumor, increased urination, increased
thirst, increased heart rate, hyperactivity, and diarrhea. Diagnosis is
215
216
SECTION 1 NUTRITION AND DIETARY MANAGEMENT
made by identifying increased levels of circulating thyroid hormones.
The initiating cause of hyperthyroidism is still unknown. In several
epidemiological studies, cats fed carned foods were at increased risk
of developing hyperthyroidism compared to those fed dry or semi-
moist cat foods. Variation in iodine content in cat diets has been sug-
gested as a potential cause of hyperthyroidism, but this has not been
proven. Further studies are necessary to determine the cause of feline
hyperthyroidism. Treatment involves either surgical removal or
radioactive iodine destruction of the thyroid tumor, or blockage of
thyroid hormone production with medical therapy. Most cats with
hyperthyroidism are thin and in an energy-deficient state. Many cats
with hyperthyroidism also have some degree of renal disease, and
excess dietary protein should be avoided with renal disease. Diets for
hyperthyroidism should be aimed at providing adequate calorie
intake. The fat content may be increased to provide higher energy to
the diet.
Hyperthyroidism is rare in dogs and is caused by a thyroid carci-
noma. Most thyroid carcinomas are norfunctional and do rot cause
hyperthyroidism. Hyperthyroidism orly occurs in about 10%-20% of
thyroid carcinomas. Clinical signs include a visible neck mass, cough-
ing, difficulty in swallowing, change in voice, weight loss, and hyper-
activity. Treatment of canine hyperthyroidism includes surgery and
chemotherapy. If the dog is thin, a diet providing increased energy is
appropriate.
Adrenal Gland Disorders
  Hyperadrenocorticism
Hyperadrenocorticism (Cushing's disease) is caused by an excess
in cortisol secretion. Clirical signs of hyperadrenocorticism include
increased urination, increased thirst, increased appetite, weight gain,
pot-bellied appearance, panting, muscle wasting, and loss of hair
Hypertension is common, and diabetes mellitus may also be present.
Hyperadrenocorticism is much more common in dogs than in cats.
Medical treatment is necessary to control the clirical signs of hyper
adrenocorticism. Diets designed for adult maintenance are suitable,
and diets lower in fat and higher in fiber may be beneficial for
weight loss. Excessive salt should be avoided if hypertension is
present.
CHAPTER 17 DIET AND ENDOCRINE DISEASE
217
Hypoadrenocorticism
Hypoadrenocorticism (Addison's disease) is caused by deficiency
of mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) secretion and a deficiency of corti-
sol production. Hypoadrenocorticism usually affects younger dogs
and is characterized by vague clinical signs such as vomiting, diarrhea,
- re   s  n pe ' ss nim
sorian crisis, with collapse, shock, or death. Medical treatment is
required to control hypoadrenocorticism. Diets designed for adult
maintenance (or growth if still a puppy) are suitable, although exces-
sive dietary potassium should be avoided.
Parathyroid Gland Disorders
Hypoparafhyroidism
Hypoparathyroidism is caused by a deficiency of parathyroid
hormone
(PTH)
 secretion   by  the  parathyroid  glands.
Hypoparathyroidism is not common, but is more common in dogs
than in cats. A decrease in PTH production can be due to destruction
of the parathyroid glands or can be due to surgery in the neck that
d  s pd a on Ains poa sis
glands secrete PTH, which is a key hormone involved in calcium
metabolism. With a deficiency of PTH production, serum calcium
concentration decreases. Clirical signs of low serum calcium (hypo-
calcemia) include twitching, facial rubbing, self-mutilation, and sei-
Zures. Medical treatment includes the admiristration of calcium
supplements, calcitriol (the active form of vitamin D), and possibly
magnesium supplementation. These treatments carnot be provided in
the diet, as doses must be closely moritored. Diets designed for adult
maintenance are generally suitable.
 Primary Hyperparathyroidism
  e  s s s 
tumor that secretes excessive PTH. Excessive PTH results in anl
increased serum calcium concentration, which leads to an increase in
urination, increased thirst, lethargy, and loss of appetite. Diagnosis is
   s s    
PTH. Primary hyperparathyroidism is more common in dogs, and
218
SECTION1NUTRITIONANDDIETARYMANAGEMENT
there are some breeds that are predisposed to it (keeshonds). Treatment
involves removal of the parathyroid tumor. After surgery, the serum
calcium concentration may be low until the parathyroid glands return
to function, and supplemented calcium may be required for a short
period after surgery. Diets for adult maintenance are suitable.
Nutritional Secondary Hyperparathyroidism
taining excessive phosphorus or inadequate calcium or vitamin D
content. Deficient diets are typically homemade diets made primarily
with meat. The imbalance of dietary calcium and phosphorus causes
a decrease in the serum calcium concentration, which stimulates PTH
secretion. Excess PTH production causes bone resorption in an effort
to maintain a normal serum calcium concentration. Clirical signs
  s    s d  
more common in young, growing animals. Nutritional secondary
hyperparathyroidism can also occur in arimals with severe gastroin-
testinal disease that causes decreased absorption of calcium or vitamin
D. Treatmert is to provide a balanced diet.
 Renal Secondary Hyperparathyroidism
present. With the progressive destruction of kidney cells, there is
decreased ability to synthesize the active form of vitamin D (which
occurs in the kidney). The lack of the active form of vitamin D (cal-
citriol) results in a decrease in the serum calcium concentration, which
stimulates PTH secretior. In renal disease, the excess PTH causes bone
resorption, particularly in the bones of the skull, resulting in "rubber
jaw." Calcitriol is given to alleviate the excess PTH; dietary manage
ment includes feeding a renal diet with restricted phosphorus content.
Vitamin D Toxicity
Vitamin D toxicity can occur from oversupplementation with
vitamin D, cholecalciferol rodenticide ingestion, ingestion of plants,
such as Cestrum diurnum, containing vitamin D metabolites. The excess
ingested vitamin D results in an increase in serum calcium with sup-
pression of PTH production. Serum phosphorus is also increased as a
result; calcium and phosphorus can bind and precipitate in organs,
CHAPTER 17 DIET AND ENDOCRINE DISEASE
219
an acute onset of increased urination, increased thirst, anorexia,
depression, vomiting. and diarrhea. Acute renal failure is common.
Medical treatment is designed to decrease serum calcium and phos
phorus and to treat reral disease. Treatment may need to be prolonged
since vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, and excess can remain in the
body for months. Renal diets with restricted phosphorus may be
appropriate.
Idiopathic Hypercalcemia in Cats
IHC can occur in young to old cats, and long-haired cats have a higher

chronic constipation, and calcium oxalate-containing urinary stones.
Some may develop renal failure. IHC is characterized by an elevated

No treatment has worked consistently. In some cats, increasing the
fiber in the diet has been helpful in lowering the serum calcium.
Further studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of dietary
therapy and to determine the cause of IHC.
Pancreatic Disorders
Insulinoma
Insulinoma is a malignant tumor of the pancreas that results in an
excessive secretion of insulin. Insulinomas are uncommon in dogs and
rare in cats, but when present usually occur in older dogs. Medium to
larger breed dogs are predisposed to insulinoma. Clinical signs may
be episodic and are more common after eating. Clirical signs include
lethargy, weakness, loss of coordination, dementia, seizures, and
coma. Diagnosis is based on finding a low serum concentration of
glucose with an excessive concentration of insulin. Surgical treatment
is the best optior to remove the tumor, but metastasis is ofter presenf
or the tumor carnot be completely removed. Simple sugars should be
avoided in the diet since these carbohydrates cause ant excess secretion
of insulin. Complex carbohydrates from starch are preferred. The fiber
in the diet should also be less than 5% of the dry matter (Table 17.1).
Amino acids also stimulate the release of insulin. Excessive dietary

should be 15%-25% DM for dogs and 28%-45% DM for cats. Higher-
fat diets may be beneficial for those with insulinoma, but this needs
to be investigated. Multiple small meals should be fed throughout the
day to try to maintain a constant energy intake and to prevent a large
release of insulin that can occur after a big meal.
 Diabetes Mellitus
Diabetes mellitus is a pancreatic disorder characterized by an
increase in blood glucose concentration. Dogs typically have insulin-
dependent diabetes mellitus (type l), in which there is a lack of insulin
produced from the pancreas. Cats, on the other hand, usually have
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM; type 2) in which
cells become urresponsive to the effects of insulin (insulin resistance)
and blood glucose elevates, causing further insulin release. Thus in
NIDDM, both blood glucose and insulin concentrations are initially
increased. NIDDM is most common in humans as well. With time, the
cells secreting insulin eventually "burn out" and stop secreting insulin.
Thus, these patients may become permanently insulin-dependent
In dogs, the average age at diagnosis is 7 to 9 years and is more
common in females. Breeds that appear to be predisposed include
keeshonds, miriature and toy poodles, dachshund, miriature schnau-
zer, beagle, puli, Cairn terrier, and miriature pinscher. In cats more
than 50% of those affected are older than 10 years of age. The incidence
in cats is approximately 0.5%, and obesity increases the risk threefold
to fivefold. Male cats have an increased risk, and neutered cats are at
twice the risk for developing diabetes.
Clinical signs do not typically develop until the blood glucose con-
centration is greater than 180-200mg/dL in dogs and 200-280mg/d1
in cats. Clirical signs include increased thirst, increased urination, and

usually based on finding a persistent elevation in blood glucose
(hyperglycemia) and the presence of glucose in urine (glycosuria)
Ketones may also be present in urine (ketonuria), which confirms the
presence of diabetic ketoacidosis.
The goal of therapy is to eliminate clirical signs and to prevent the
development of complications. Insulin therapy is the major treatment
for diabetes mellitus. Dietary management is also very important in
diabetes. Dietary carbohydrate is probably the most important factor
to manage.
Dietary Management of the Dog with Diabetes Mellitus
In people with diabetes mellitus, daily insulin therapy is constantly
adjusted based on repeated blood glucose measuremert, but this is

dosages are typically used to manage diabetic dogs, thus diets should
provide a constant amount of carbohydrate each day. Dietary carbo-
hydrate should be present at 50%-55% DM (Table 17.2). Rice is a
highly digestible carbohydrate source, but it may elicit a higher glucose
response than some other carbohydrate sources. Sorghum or barley
may be better carbohydrate sources in diets for dogs with diabetes
mellitus. The amount of dietary fiber is controversial in diabetes mel-
litus, but it appears that dogs with type 1 diabetes mellitus do not
require any more fiber than those without diabetes mellitus. Moderate

ment of diabetes mellitus, but high-fiber diets are not necessary.
Alterations in fat metabolism occur in diabetes mellitus, and
increases in serum cholesterol and triglyceride are common.
Atherosclerosis is not a typical problem in dogs as compared to
humans, due to differences in lipid metabolism, but atherosclerosis
has been reported in dogs with diabetes mellitus. Dogs with diabetes
mellitus are also at increased risk for the development of pancreatifis
So some restriction in dietary fat may be beneficial. Dietary fat should

Dietary Management of the Cat with Diabetes Mellitus
One of the goals of dietary therapy in the diabetic cat is to maintain
good body condition and control excess body weight. The optimal diet
for diabetic cats should be high in protein, moderate in energy and fat,
 4    1     
sources should provide less than 20% of the total energy and should
be complex carbohydrates rather than simple sugars. Rice is highly
digestible but elicits a high glycemic response; thus, it is not an optimal
source of carbohydrate. Moderate- to high-fiber content is beneficial
to slow Gl transit time and helps to control body weight. Fiber is
usually present at 10%-15% DM. The fat content of the diet should be
less than 20% DM. An increased concentration of fish oil in the diet
may be beneficial by providing omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty
acids may improve insulin sensitivity by activation of certain cellular
receptors. Cats with diabetes mellitus should be fed twice daily to
coincide with insulin injections.
Lipid Metabolic Disorders
  s s  p aa  s  s 
in lipid metabolism. Lipid metabolism is complex and involves many
enzymes and organs. Dietary cholesterol and triglycerides are absorbed
in the small intestine with the help of bile. The absorbed cholesterol
and triglycerides are transported to the liver, where they can be stored,
secreted in bile, or packaged into lipoproteins. Lipoproteins are then
released from the liver and can transport cholesterol and triglycerides
to many other tissues. Dogs and cats both produce chylomicrons, very
low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs), low-density lipoproteins (LDLs)
and high-density lipoproteins (HDLs), as do humans, but there are
major metabolic differences in lipoprotein metabolism between pets
and humans. Humans are very prone to atherosclerosis, whereas dogs
and cats are not typically affected. Thus, the concern of atherosclerosis
in humans surrounding the consumption of high-fat diets is not a
problem in most pets.
Lipid metabolic disorders are classified as either primary, where
there is a defect in some metabolic process, or secondary, where the
lipid alterations are being caused by another disease. Diseases that can
cause changes in lipid metabolism include hypothyroidism, hyperad-
renocorticism, diabetes mellitus, kidney disease, pancreatitis, and
some types of liver disease.
Normally, there will be high levels of lipid present in serum after
a meal, but this lipid should be cleared from the serum as it is being
delivered to the liver. When this clearing process is slow, excessive
amounts of lipid remain in the serum (hyperlipidemia) for long
periods of time. Thus, the most common clirical sign suggesting the
presence of a lipid metabolic disorder is hyperlipidemia after a 12-
hour fast. Hypothyroidism is a common cause of fasting hyperlip-
idemia in dogs, and dogs with fasting hyperlidemia are 3.2
         
order, the lipid metabolism problems will be corrected. If there is
no secondary cause of hyperlipidemia, then a primary lipid defect
proteinemia in the dog and idiopathic hyperchylomicronemia in
the cat.
Idiopathic hyperlipoproteinemia has been observed in a rumber of
dog breeds, including the miriature schnauzer, Shetland sheepdog.
beagle, miriature poodle, cocker spariel, English cocker spariel, and
mixed-breed dogs. Miriature schnauzers have the highest incidence
Clirical signs associated with idiopathic hyperlipoproteinemia include
abdominal pain (possibly due to concurrent pancreatitis) and seizures,
but many dogs have no clinical signs. One of the defects present in
idiopathic hyperlipoproteinemia is a lack of lipoprotein lipase (LPL)
   r  a r  s a 
protein from the serum. Long-term effects of chronic hyperlipidemia
are unknown, but atherosclerosis, pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus, or
renal damage may be sequelae.
In cats, the most common primary lipid disorder is idiopathic
hyperchylomicronemia, which is most likely a hereditary condition.
Idiopathic hyperchylomicronemia usually affects young cats, and the
 most common clinical signs are lipid deposits in the skin and organs
and presence of lipid in the eye. Kittens may be weak, lethargic, and
fail to grow due to the excessive lipid. Blood will often have a "cream
of tomato soup" appearance. There is a severe decrease in LPL activity
in cats with hyperchylomicronemia, which greatly slows the clearance
of ingested and absorbed cholesterol and triglyceride. Atherosclerosis

unless the presence of other conditions (such as renal disease) war
rants their use. A low-fat diet should be chosen on the basis of the total
energy provided by fat rather than the percentage of fat in the diet on
a dry matter basis. After feeding the low-fat diet for 6-8 weeks, the
presence of hyperlipidemia should be reevaluated. If hyperlipidemia

oil/10lb body weight is added to the treatment regimen. At this level
of fish oil supplementation, the dog may have a fishy odor. Fish oil
supplements contairing high levels of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids
are effective at lowering serum triglyceride, cholesterol, and lipopro-
tein concentrations. Fish oils may also be important in the prevention
of pancreatitis and diabetes mellitus. Little is known regarding the use
of fish oil supplementation in cats, but if high levels of fish oil are
given, then additional vitamin E should be added to the diet as an
antioxidant.
Other Disorders
Acromegaly
Acromegaly occurs when the secretion of growth hormone is exces-
sive. Growth hormone is secreted by the pituitary gland and causes a
release of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) from the liver. The diag-
nosis of acromegaly is determined by an increase in IGF-l concentra
tions. Excess growth hormone secretion causes a proliferation of bone
cartilage and an increase in organ size. Clirical signs include broaden-
ing of the skull, an increase in tongue size, increased spacing between
the teeth, and increased size of the paws. An increase in the size of the
CHAPTER 17 DIET AND ENDOCRINE DISEASE 225
liver and heart is also typical. Acromegaly is much more common in
older cats, especially those with diabetes mellitus. Diets for cats with
acromegaly should contain highly digestible protein, should be low in
fat (<12% DM), low in simple sugars, and have a moderate fiber
content (8%-17% DM). Diets designed for diabetes mellitus are
suitable.
 Diabetes Insipidus
Diabetes insipidus (Dl) is characterized by increased urination
(polyuria) and increased intake of water (polydipsia). Dl is usually
diagnosed after all other causes of increased urination and drinking
have been ruled out. Water deprivation testing is usually required for
diagnosis. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH; also known as vasopressin) is
secreted by the brain and acts in the kidney to cause reabsorption of
water. Dl is due either to a lack of secretion of ADH or kidney insen-
     s     
Dl. Diets recommended for adult maintenance are suitable, but exces-
sive salt intake should be avoided. An ample supply of water must be
available at all times.

CHAPTER 18
Diet and Heart Disease
Heart disease is common in older dogs and cats. There are many types
of heart disease, and most have different breed predispositions. Dilated
cardiomyopathy (DCM) was once very common in cats, but since the
discovery that taurine deficiency was the cause, supplementation of
cat diets with taurine is common and the incidence of DCM in cats has
decreased. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is row the most common
cause of heart disease in cats. Dilated cardiomyopathy has become
more common in dogs, especially in large breeds. Hypertension in
dogs and cats is more common now, most likely due to increased
awareness and moritoring of blood pressure in dogs and cats. The
most common heart disorders that require dietary management are
congestive heart failure, hypertension, and heart diseases related to
deficiency of a specific nutrient (taurine, carritine).
Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a general term and not a specific
disease. In general, heart failure is characterized by a heart that is
unable to pump adequately and carnot deliver nutrients (especially
oxygen) to tissues. Clirical signs of heart failure include weakness,
exercise intolerance, fainting, coughing, abnormal breath sounds, and
fluid retention. Renal disease is commonly present in association with
heart disease.
Weight Management
Pets with CHF commonly have weight loss, which is termed cardiac
cachexia. In dogs and cats with CHF, amino acids serve as the primary
229
230SECTION 1 NUTRITION ANDDIETARYMANAGEMENT
source of energy, and lean body mass is lost. Loss of muscle mass is
commorly noted in the shoulders, back, and facial muscles. Cardiac
cachexia is most common in dogs with DCM. Weight loss is caused
by a decrease in food intake, increased energy requirements, or altera-
tions in metabolism. Decreased appetite (anorexia) is common in CHF
is increased, and these mediators can cause anorexia. Dietary
therapy should provide adequate energy to prevent weight loss.
Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids, such as those present in
fish oils, may be beneficial in decreasing the production of inflamma-
tory mediators.
Some dogs with CHF may be obese. Obesity contributes to the clirni-
cal signs of CHF, and a weight reduction program should be initiated.
Careful attention must be paid to the amount of treats given, as these
can be a sigrificant source of calories. Any treats given should be both
low in calories and low in sodium.
Dietary Sodium
The restriction of dietary sodium has been debated in patients with
CHF. Recent studies have suggested that severe sodium restriction
may not be beneficial when the early stages of cardiac disease are
present. If asymptomatic heart disease is present, there is a heart
murmur or arrhythmia, but clirical signs of heart disease are not
noted. In these patients, severe sodium restriction is not necessary, but
diets, treats, and table foods high in sodium (greater than
100mg/1ookcal) should be avoided. If there is erlargement of the
heart ventricles, then the sodium content of the diet should be restrictec
to 50-80mg/100kcal. With mild to moderate CHF, clirical signs are
present with mild exercise or at rest. Coughing, exercise intolerance,
mild respiratory distress is usually noted. Sodium content should be
restricted to 50-80mg/100kcal or should be restricted to less than
50mg/1ookcal if increasing doses of diuretics are needed to control
clirical signs. With advanced heart failure, clinical signs of heart
failure are severe. Sodium content in the diet should be restricted to
less than 50mg/100 kcal, and sodium intake from treats or table foods
must be restricted. On a dry matter basis, sodium should be restricted
to 0.07%-0.25% DM in dogs and 0.3% DM in cats (Table 18.1). Chloride
levels are usually 1.5 times the sodium intake. Recommended and
norrecommended ingredients for cardiac diets based on sodium
content are listed in Table 18.2.

can not overcome this continued loss. DCM is uncommon in cats since
cat diets are routinely supplemented with taurine.
DCM has become more prevalent in dogs. Some breeds with DCM
also appear to have an increased incidence of taurine deficiency (cocker
spariel, Newfoundland, golden retriever, Scottish terrier, border
collie), thus plasma taurine should be measured in these breeds. Dogs
A n r p a pe q  e   
low-protein diets should also have plasma taurine measured. In dogs
with low levels of taurine, 500-1000mg taurine should be given twice
daily.
Fat provides an important source of calories. Dogs with DCM have
sigrificantly lower circulating concentrations of long-chain omega-3
fatty acids, specifically eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexae-
noic acid (DHA). EPA and DHA are found in fish oil. Fish oil therapy
reduces the production of inflammatory mediators and improves the
CHAPTER 18 DIET AND HEART DISEASE
233
anorexia present in some patients with CHF. Fish oil has been supple-
mented at a dose of 1 capsule/10lb body weight. Sources of omega-3
fatty acids other than fish oil, such as flaxseed oil, should not be used.
Potassium
 Potassium is an important electrolyte for proper cardiac function. A
decrease in potassium (hypokalemia) causes muscle weakness and
decreases the effectiveness of some cardiac drugs. The use of some
diuretics (furosemide) can predispose a patient with CHF to hypoka
lemia. The potassium content of the diet should be high enough to
provide adequate potassium intake.
Magnesium
Magnesium is important in many enzymatic reactions, and serum
magnesium concentration is often low in CHF. A decrease in serum
magnesium can increase the risk of arrhythmias and can decrease the
 contraction of the heart. If deficient, magnesium can be supplemented
at 20-40mg/kg body weight/day. Excess magnesium should also be
avoided.
L-Carnitine
Arimals use lysine and methiorine to synthesize L-carritine. This
compound is classified as a water-soluble vitamin or a nonessential
amino acid. It is needed to transport free fatty acids into the mitochon-
dria of cardiac muscle. Carritine is esterified with fatty acids to facili-
tate their movement across cell membranes. Inside mitochondria,
oxidation of fatty acids generates energy in the form of ATP. Carritine
remairing after fat oxidation forms esters with potentially toxic waste
products and transports them from the mitochondria.
Carritine is usually present in high concentration in cardiac muscle,
    o  s   
humans. Carritine is abundant in red meat. Feeding nonmeat-based
diets to dogs results in plasma carritine levels that are 50% lower than
in those consuming meat-based diets. It is unclear whether L-carritine
supplementation is beneficial in pets with heart disease. The recom-
mended dose is 50-100mg/kg body weight every 8 hours. Few side
234
SECTION 1 NUTRITION AND DIETARY MANAGEMENT
effects have been noted with carnitine supplementation, but L-
carritine is expensive, which may be a deterrent to treatment.
Coenzyme Q10
Coenzyme Q10 is required for energy production, and deficiency may
play a role in heart disease. Coenzyme Ql0 supplementation has been
used in patients with DCM and may provide increased antioxidant
protection. The recommended dose is 30-90mg twice daily, depend-
ing on the body weight. Controlled studies are needed to evaluate the
benefits of coenzyme Q10.

CHAPTER 19
Diet and Pancreatic Disease
There are several diseases of the pancreas that can be managed in part
with diet. Both dogs and cats can be affected with pancreatitis, the
 e e  's  s   o  
can benefit from dietary modification.
Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency
The pancreas plays a critical role in the digestion of nutrients by syn-
thesizing and secreting enzymes that digest fat, carbohydrate, and
proteins. The pancreas also secretes bicarbonate to maintain the pH
of the intestinal tract in an optimal range for digestion and secretes a
factor necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12. When functional
pancreatic mass is lost, there is a decrease in production of these
digestive enzymes, which decreases the digestion and absorption of
rutrients.
 Chroric diarrhea is usually present in dogs with exocrine pancre-
 pn pand ae s go s ari ( ns 
gray or yellow in color, and stools have the consistency of cow feces.
Dogs typically are affected with flatulence and defecate more than
three times per day. Weight loss may be mild to extreme, and these
appetite, and coprophagia and pica are common. The hair coat is
usually poor, and there may be muscle loss.
237
238SECTION1NUTRITIONANDDIETARYMANAGEMENT
EPI is uncommon in cats. In cats with EPl, the clinical signs are
typically weight loss and soft voluminous feces. Diarrhea is not as
common in cats as it is in dogs.
The biochemistry profile is usually normal in dogs with EPl. Dogs
with EPl do not typically have low plasma protein concentrations.
Concentrations of vitamins Bi2, A, and E are decreased in dogs with
EPl, and folate concentrations are often increased. A decrease in serum
trypsin-like immunoreactivity (TLl) is definitive for EPl. A feline-
specific TLI (fTLI) is now available, and a decrease in fTLI is diagnostic
for EPI in cats.
Atrophy of the pancreas is the common cause of EPl in dogs less
than 5 years old; in older dogs the cause is usually chronic pancreatitis.
In cats, chroric pancreatitis is the common cause of EPl and occurs in
older cats. Atrophy of the pancreas has not been noted in cats. German
shepherd dogs, collies, and English setters are at increased risk for
atrophy of the pancreas and development of EPl. Miriature schnau-
zers are predisposed to chronic pancreatitis and have a higher inci
dence of developing EPl. In cats there is no breed predisposition to
EPI.
For treatment of EPl, enzyme preparations must be added to the
food to help the dog or cat digest the nutrients. Powdered erzyme
preparations must be fresh and stored properly to be effective. The
goal is to use the lowest dose of enzymes that is effective due to the
cost of these preparations. Powdered enzymes should be mixed with
the food immediately prior to feeding; preincubating the food with the
enzyme preparation is not necessary. As an alternative to powdered
enzyme preparations, raw fresh pancreas can be fed. Cow pancreas is
safest, but there is always the risk of bacterial irfection causing Gl
upset from raw meat. Fresh pancreas can be stored frozen for several
months. The pancreas tissue cannot be cooked, as this will destroy the
rations, vitamin B2 should be supplemented, since the enzyme supple
ments do not improve the absorption of vitamin Bi2. An injection of
vitamin Bi2 once per month is adequate to prevent deficiency.
Diets designed for pets with EPl need to be highly digestible.
Typical protein sources include egg. cottage cheese, and muscle meats,
and carbohydrate sources usually include rice or barley. The fiber
            
of the diet does not need to be restricted. Diets with up to 19% DM fat
or diets providing 43% calories from fat have been well tolerated by
dogs with EP1 (Table 19.1). Several small meals should be fed each day
rather than feeding one large meal.

Pancreatitis
Pancreatic inflammation is relatively common, and it can be life-threat-
ering. Acute pancreatitis can be difficult to diagrose. In dogs, the typical
clinical signs are vomiting, anorexia, and abdominal pain. Other signs
include depression, fever, diarrhea, abdominal distention, dehydration
shock, respiratory distress, and cardiac arrhythmias. In cats, the most
common clirical signs include lethargy, anorexia, and dehydration,
which are nonspecific signs. Vomiting and abdominal pain are uncom-
mon clirical signs in the cat. Chroric pancreatitis is more difficult to
recogrize since it is characterized by subclirical inflammation and clini-
the only clirical signs associated with chroric pancreatitis. Chronic
pancreatitis may lead to the development of diabetes mellitus or EPl.
The cause of pancreatitis is poorly understood. In dogs, dietary
indiscretion, obesity, or the consumption of a high-fat meal may be
related to the development of pancreatitis. Dogs over 5 years of age
are at higher risk for pancreatitis, and miriature schnauzers, Yorkshire
terriers, silky terriers, and miriature poodles are more commonly
affected. In cats, dietary indiscretion, obesity, or the consumption of
 d on       s r
risk of chroric pancreatitis increases with age in the cat, but there is
no breed or sex predispositionl.
Previously, increases in serum amylase and lipase activities have
been used to diagnose pancreatitis, but these enzymes can be elevated
in arimals without pancreatitis. Assays for pancreatic-specific enzymes
have been developed. In dogs with acute pancreatitis, TLI, trypsinogen
activation peptide (TAP), and pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (PLI)
have been elevated. Elevations in PLI may be the most specific for
pancreatitis, but TLI, TAP, and PLI may also be elevated in renal
disease. Serum amylase and lipase can not be used to diagnose pancre
atitis in cats. Feline-specific TLI is not very useful for diagnosing pan-
creatitis in cats, but feline-specific PLI appears to be more sensitive.
Abdominal ultrasound is useful in the diagnosis of pancreatitis,
especially in cats with chronic pancreatitis. Normally, the pancreas is
240SECTION 1 NUTRITION ANDDIETARYMANAGEMENT
not visible on ultrasound, but if inflammation is present, the pancreas
can be seen.
Pancreatitis occurs when digestive enzymes are activated in the
betes mellitus or EPl in dogs. The activation of pancreatic enzymes
causes the release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-o), interleukin-1
(IL-l), and platelet-activating factor (PAF), which result in increased
irflammation of the pancreas. Thus, the cycle of inflammation is some
what self-perpetuating.
Treatment for pancreatitis involves both medical and dietary man-
agement. Intravenous fluids and antibiotics are essential in the treat-
ment of acute pancreatitis. Initially, no food is given orally to dogs
because food in the duodenum stimulates the release of more pancre
atic enzymes, which can worsen the inflammation. However, there is
debate as to the use of parenteral (intravenous) versus enteral rutri-
Hion. Enteral rutrifion can be provided via the placement of a jejunos.
tomy tube through which a liquid diet is placed directly into the
jejunum. Patients receiving a combination of both enteral and paren
teral nutrition appear to have an increased survival rate as compared
to those receiving parenteral nutrition alone.
In dogs, oral feeding can be reinitiated when vomiting stops. Cats
rarely exhibit vomiting, but typically do not want to eat early in the
course of acute pancreatifis. Cats should not be forced to eat orally, as
this can cause food aversion, and it is difficult to force-feed an ade-
quate number of calories.
 Oral diets for dogs and cats recovering from pancreatitis should be
highly digestible. Some amino acids can excessively stimulate pancre-
atic enzyme release, so excess dietary protein should be avoided.
Dietary protein levels in dogs should be between 15% and 30% DM
and in cats should be between 30% and 45% DM (Table 19.2). The fat
Dogs that are obese or who have hypertriglyceridemia should be fed
a low-fat diet (less than 10% DM). If these conditions are not present,
then a moderate fat diet (10%-15% fat DM) can be fed. Cats recovering
from pancreatitis should receive a moderate-fat diet.

unknown in the dog and cat. Probiotics may be helpful in treating
pancreatitis, since probiotics appear to improve the intestinal barrier
and suppress inflammation. Vitamin B supplementation may be ben-
eficial since serum vitamin Bi is often low in pancreatitis patients.
 Injectable vitamin Bi2 can be given weekly to treat deficiency.

CHAPTER2O
Diet and Hepatic Disease
The liver is a major metabolic organ and carries out over 15o0 bio-
chemical functions. The liver is important in drug metabolism; in
removal of toxic substances; in the synthesis of albumin, clotting
factors, bile salts, and lipoproteins; and in the digestion and metabo-
lism of rutrients. Protein metabolic functions of the liver include the
synthesis of albumin, acute-phase proteins, coagulation factors, the
regulation of amino acid metabolism, and detoxification of ammoria
and the synthesis of urea. The liver is important in carbohydrate
metabolism for glycogen metabolism and storage, glucose homeosta-
sis, and the synthesis of glucose. Lipid metabolic functions include
the synthesis of triglycerides, phospholipids, cholesterol, lipoproteins,
and bile acids. The liver is also important for clearance and storage of
lipid, lipid oxidation, ketone production, and excretion of cholesterol.
Vitamin C is synthesized by the liver, and vitamin D is hydroxylated
by the liver. Vitamins B and K are also activated by and stored in the
liver. The liver is important for the degradation of polypeptides and
steroid hormones, and stores vitamins, lipids, glycogen, copper, iron,
and zinc. The liver plays a role in digestion by synthesizing bile acids
and participating in the enterohepatic circulation, absorbing the fat
soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K), and digesting and absorbing lipids.
The liver is a large organ with tremendous reserve and regenerative
capabilities. This is important to maintain adequate function since the
liver is so critical to metabolism. However, this also means that by the
time clirical signs of liver disease are evident, liver damage is often
       ss   
cific and often go unnoticed. Early signs include loss of appetite,
243
244
SECTION1NUTRITIONANDDIETARYMANAGEMENT
weight loss, lethargy, vomiting, diarrhea, increased thirst, and
increased urination. Once advanced liver disease is present, pets may
be jaundiced, have fluid accumulation in the abdomen (ascites), have
hepatic encephalopathy, and blood coagulation problems. If there is
major bile duct obstruction, feces may be pale or gray in color. Jaundice
is not a common sign of liver disease and may be due to severe hemo-
lysis or compression of the bile duct by pancreatitis or neoplasia.
Ascites is common in dogs, but uncommon in cats, and is typically
caused by portal hypertension. With chronic liver disease, the liver is
usually decreased in size. The liver may be erlarged in cases of neo
plasia and with feline hepatic lipidosis.
Laboratory Testing
Serum biochemistry is useful when looking for evidence of hepatic
disease. Many serum enzymes can be elevated in liver disease, includ-
ing alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT))
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and gamma-glutamyltransferase
(GGT). Other parameters such as bilirubin, albumin, globulin, urea
ritrogen, glucose, and cholesterol may be altered in liver disease.
Serum bile acids also increase in liver disease. Urfortunately, there are
no specific tests for the different liver disorders. Abdominal radio
graphs can provide an estimate of liver size and shape, but abdominal
ultrasound gives more specific information about the liver, bile ducts,
        a  
underlying cause of liver disease. Liver copper levels can also be
determined from a biopsy sample.
Causes of Liver Disease
Liver diseases can be the result of inflammatory, noninflammatory, or
biliary causes. Irfectious inflammatory liver disease can be caused by
bacteria (leptospirosis, toxoplasmosis, cholangiohepatitis), or viruses
(infectious carine hepatitis, feline infectious peritoritis). Norirfectious
inflammatory causes include chroric hepatitis, cirrhosis and fibrosis,
lymphocytic cholangitis, or toxins and drugs. Norinflammatory liver
disease can be caused by vacuolar hepatopathy (storage disorders.
steroid therapy, diabetes mellitus, chronic illness, hepatocutaneous
syndrome), portosystemic shunts, or neoplasia. Bile duct disease
can be caused by obstruction, secondary to liver disease, or
irflammation
CHAPTER 2ODIET AND HEPATIC DISEASE245
Risk Factors
Any breed can be affected by liver disease; however, some breeds are
predisposed to particular disorders. Bedlington terriers are at increased
risk for genetic copper-associated hepatic disease; West Highland
white terriers, Skye terriers, and Doberman pinschers are at increased
risk for chroric hepatitis; cocker spariels, standard poodles, Labrador
retrievers, and Scotftish terriers are prone to idiopathic cirrhosis; and
r e       rs 
fibrosis. Copper accumulation in association with liver disease is
common in Doberman pinschers, Dalmatians, West Highland white
terriers, Skye terriers, and cocker spariels. Portosystemic shunts occur

hepatitis, and acute hepatic toxicity is associated with potentiated
sulfonamides, carprofen, and mebendazole. Glucocorticoid therapy or
cause steroid hepatopathy.
Nutrient Alterations in Liver Disease
Protein Alterations
The liver is responsible for the synthesis of the majority of the cir-
culating proteins; albumin makes up about 60% of the total plasma
proteins. Albumin has many roles, helps maintain plasma oncotic
pressure, and serves as a binding and carrier protein for hormones,
steroids, amino acids, vitamins, fatty acids, calcium, and other drugs.
factors. With severe liver disease, there is a decrease in synthesized
albumin (hypoalbuminemia), which can lead to edema and ascites.
The liver is also important in degradation of excess dietary proteins,
and amino acids not needed for protein synthesis are deaminated and
oxidized by the liver. The aromatic amino acids (tyrosine, phenylala-
246
SECTION1NUTRITIONANDDIETARYMANAGEMENT
nine, and tryptophan) are normally removed from the portal circula-
tion and metabolized by the liver; with liver disease, these amino acids
accumulate in the circulation. The concentrations of most other amino
acids are decreased because of increased use by muscle and fat tissue.
Alterations in amino acid concentrations may play a role in the devel-
opment of hepatic encephalopathy.
Nitrogen metabolism is also altered in liver disease, with an increase
in circulating ammonia. Hyperammonemia may be due to amino acid
ammonia to the liver as a result of portosystemic shunts.
Carbohydrate Alterations
The liver plays a major role in carbohydrate metabolism. Liver is
the storage organ for glycogen, which can be readily mobilized when
glucose is needed. There is adequate liver glycogen to normally meet
the needs for glucose for about 24 to 36 hours, but with cirrhosis,
glycogen is depleted in 10 to 12 hours. With liver disease, there is
increased protein breakdown to provide amino acids for glucose pro
duction, which occurs in the liver. Blood glucose concentrations can
be maintained with as little as one-fourth of the functional liver tissue,
but a decrease in circulating glucose (hypoglycemia) can occur with
cirrhosis, hepatic failure, or hepatic neoplasia. An excess of circulating
glucose (hyperglycemia) can occur in cats with hepatic lipidosis. With
liver cirrhosis, there may be an increase in circulating glucagon, result-
ing in a necrotizing skin disease (hepatocutaneous syndrome).
 Lipid Alterations
The liver is very important in lipid metabolism. Fatty acids are
synthesized in the liver and can be stored as triglycerides. When liver
glycogen becomes depleted, fatty acids are released from fat tissue and
are oxidized by the liver. Ketone bodies are produced and can be an
important energy source. Carritine is a cofactor necessary for trans-
port of fatty acids from the cytoplasm into mitochondria, and the liver
is important in carritine metabolism. With liver disease, there may be
decreased synthesis of carritine or increased carritine turnover.
Carritine supplementation may be beneficial in the prevention of
hepatic lipidosis in cats.
Lipoprotein metabolism is altered with liver failure since the liver
plays a major role in cholesterol synthesis, storage, and secretion. Bile
salt production may be decreased, and with cholestasis, hypercholes-
CHAPTER 2ODIET AND HEPATIC DISEASE
247
   d   r  
serum cholesterol (hypocholesterolemia) has been observed in patients
with portosystemic shunts or liver necrosis. Lipoprotein patterns in
dogs and cats with liver disease have not been well studied.
 Vitamins and Minerals
Fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) are stored in the liver. Vitamir
E deficiency is common in chroric liver disease and results in an
increase in oxidative damage to the liver. Vitamin K deficiency is also
times. B vitamins may be deficient in chronic liver disease, especially
vitamin Bi2. Vitamin C synthesis is also affected by liver disease.
Iron, zinc, and copper are stored in the liver. Copper accumulation
can cause hepatic damage. Copper can accumulate either as a result
of a primary defect in copper metabolism or secondary to decreased
copper excretion. Zinc deficiency is common in liver disease, and
manganese concentrations may be decreased with cirrhosis.
Liver Disorders
Hepatic Encephalopathy
Hepatic encephalopathy is a metabolic disorder that affects the
nervous system and develops secondary to advanced liver disease. It
usually occurs as a result of portosystemic shunts (PsS). Clirical signs
of hepatic encephalopathy include loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea
disorientation, blindness, and seizures. Signs may be intermittent and
associated with the ingestion of a meal high in protein.
The cause of hepatic encephalopathy is not knowr, but may be due
to excess ammoria, amino acids, or altered neurotransmitters. An
increase in circulating ammoria is common in both dogs and cats with
PSS. Amino acid alterations are present in hepatic encephalopathy
Excess dietary methionine should be avoided in arimals with PSS
since this can result in signs of hepatic encephalopathy. Arginine defi-
ciency can also lead to signs of hepatic encephalopathy. Arimal-source
proteins are high in arginine, but vegetable-based diets for pets with
liver disease should be supplemented with argirine. Dietary protein
levels are typically reduced for patients with hepatic encephalopathy.
Frequent small meals should be fed, and soy proteins may help
decrease the risk of this disease.
248
SECTION 1 NUTRITION AND DIETARY MANAGEMENT
Portosystemic Vascular Shunts
In the normal dog, blood draining the intestines (portal venous
blood) enters the liver before entering the systemic circulation. In dogs
affected with a congerital portosystemic shunt (PSS), the portal venous
typically empties into the caudal vena cava. Why these shunts occur
remains unknown. Congenital PSS has not been shown to be heredi-
tary, although more than one puppy in a litter may be affected. Many
but it may be due to urea cycle deficiencies in Irish wolfhounds.
PSSs are uncommon in cats, but Persians and Himalayans may be
predisposed.
Portal venous blood drains the intestines and contains toxins,
nutrients, intestinal and pancreatic hormones, and bacteria. When this
blood bypasses the liver, the liver does not develop normally and
lized in the liver and reach the systemic circulation, leading to clinical
signs. PSS is most commonly diagnosed in dogs less than 1 year of
age. Central nervous system (CNS) sigrs are most common and are
termed hepatic encephalopathy, since the CNS signs are related to the
 n  ss   s   
seizures. Signs are typically intermittent and progressive and may be
related to food or medication ingestion. Dogs with PSS are often thin
and small for their age and breed. Some dogs with PSS have signs of
urinary tract disease. Crystals, most commorly ammorium biurate,
may occur in the urine. Ammonia absorbed from the gut is normally
     'd    g   
leading to increased ammonia in the blood and increased ammonia
excretion in the kidney. The increased concentration of ammoria in
the kidney leads to the formation of ammonium biurate crystals.
        se s
tests that may be performed in addition to a serum biochemistry
profile are determination of serum bile acids or ammonia levels,
abdominal radiographs or ultrasound, and liver biopsy. PSS is usually
managed medically until surgery can be performed. Providing ade-
quate energy intake is important, and most dogs or cats with PSS
require the same caloric intake as a normal healthy adult dog or cat.

dietary protein should be decreased. Vegetable and dairy sources of
protein may provide better control of signs of encephalopathy. Oral
antibiotics are typically used to decrease intestinal bacteria that may

 Copper-Associated Hepatotoxicosis
Bedlington terriers can be affected by an inherited recessive disor
der characterized by accumulation of copper in the liver due to
decreased excretion of copper in bile. Approximately 25% of Bedlington
terriers are affected, and 50% are carriers. DNA testing is available to
identify affected and carrier arimals. By the time affected dogs are 2
to 4 years of age, toxic levels of copper accumulate in their livers.

mitochondria. Hepatitis occurs when liver copper concentration
exceeds 2000ppm. Necrosis of the liver occurs when liver copper
exceeds 3000ppm. Cirrhosis develops after massive liver necrosis if
the dog survives.
A number of other breeds exhibit an increase in liver copper in
chroric hepatitis and cirrhosis, but it is unclear whether excess copper
occurs prior to liver disease or is a result of decreased copper excretion
from chroric cholestasis. In breeds such as West Highland white terri-
ers, Skye terriers, Kerry blue terriers, Doberman pinschers, and cocker
riers, and concentrations do not increase with age. Hepatic copper

production of metallothionein by the intestine, which binds very effi
ciently to copper, blocking it from being absorbed. Zinc is given as a
supplement and not in the diet. Pericillamine is another compound
that is often used as a treatment to chelate copper and block the
absorption. Vitamin E supplementation has also been recommended
as a treatment in copper toxicosis.
 Feline Hepatic Lipidosis
Hepatic lipidosis occurs in cats and is characterized by extreme
accumulation of fat within the liver. This accumulation of fat causes
liver dysfunction and blockage of the bile ducts, resulting in cholesta-
rapid weight loss. Middle-aged to older cats are most commorly
affected, and any breed can develop feline hepatic lipidosis (FHL).
 Cats are carrivores and require high amounts of dietary protein and
fatty acids. Cats tend to accumulate fat in their liver cells (hepatocytes),
and in FHL this accumulation exceeds the mobilization of fat for oxi
dation and utilization. Fat accumulates in hepatocytes due to rapid
mobilization of peripheral fat. There is decreased production of lipo-
proteins by the liver in FHL, so fat remains in the liver. Decreased
levels of antioxidants such as vitamin E and glutathione lead to
increased oxidative damage, causing further liver damage.
Clirical signs of FHL include loss of appetite, rapid weight loss,
excess salivatior, and vomiting. Many cats have jaundice and a loss
of muscle mass. The liver is enlarged, and there is an increase in serum
liver enzyme concentrations. Hepatic encephalopathy may occur.
Diagnosis requires either a fine needle aspirate of liver cells, or a liver
biopsy.
Aggressive therapy is necessary since the mortality rate is high with
FHL. Nutritional support is important, and most cats require feeding
via a nasogastric tube for a short period of time because these cats are
usually anorexic. Cats should rever be force-fed orally as they develop
252SECTION 1 NUTRITION ANDDIETARY MANAGEMENT
food aversions very easily. Providing adequate calories is important,
especially in protein. Cats with FHL should be fed a diet containing
30%-45% DM protein (Table 20-1). If hepatic encephalopathy is
present, then the protein concentration should be decreased.
A decrease in serum potassium (hypokalemia) is common in FHL
due to decreased intake of potassium and the loss of potassium with
vomiting. L-Carritine supplementation may be beneficial in FHL
(250mg/cat/day). B vitamins and vitamin E should be provided in
adequate amounts.
 Cholangiohepatitis/Cholangitis in Cats
Cholangitis is inflammation of the bile duct system, and cholangio
hepatitis is inflammation of both the liver and bile duct system that
occurs primarily in cats. Mainly dogs are affected by inflammation of
the liver (hepatitis), but in cats, inflammation typically involves the
bile ducts. Persian cats are predisposed to this condition. Suppurative
cholangitis occurs usually due to a bacterial infection ascending into
the bile ducts from the intestines and frequently is a result of pancre-
atitis or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Clirical signs are acute and
include fever, vomiting, loss of appetite, and jaundice. Obstruction
of bile ducts can result from cholangitis. Early treatment usually
involves feeding via a nasogastric tube and antibiotic therapy. Later
in the course of treatment, oral feeding with a typical liver diet is
instituted.
Cholangitis with inflammation due to lymphocytes is usually due
to an immune-mediated process. The disease is chroric and slowly
progressive and characterized by weight loss, anorexia, jaundice, and
are treated nutritionally similar to cats with hepatic lipidosis.
Hepatic Amyloidosis
Hepatic amyloid accumulation may affect young adult Siamese and
Oriental shorthair cats. Clirical signs are vague, but rupture of the
liver can occur. There is no treatment.
Portal Hypertension
Portal hypertension is an increase in the blood pressure in the portal
venous system as a result of chronic fibrosis and cirrhosis of the liver
CHAPTER 2O DIET AND HePATIC DISEASE 253
sion to the diseased liver. As the portal blood pressure increases,
portosystemic shunts can develop. Shunting can lead to hepatic
lymph is impaired, and ascites is the result. Energy and protein
requirements in portal hypertension are similar to those in other liver
disorders. If ascites is present, sodium should be restricted to 0.1%-
0.25% DM in dogs and 0.20%-0.35% DM in cats.
General Nutritional Considerations

waste that is absorbed. Increased fiber can also bind bile acids and
bacteria. Dietary fiber for dogs and cats with liver disease is typically
betweer 3% to 8% DM.
A decrease in serum potassium is common due to vomiting and
decreased intake. Dietary potassium should be provided in adequate
amounts. Iron and zinc deficiency often occur with liver disease, and
should be avoided. Water-soluble vitamins (especially B vitamins) are
often deficiert in liver disease due to loss in vomit ard urine. Vitamin
Kis synthesized in the liver and may be low in those with liver disease.
Vitamin K deficiency can lead to clotting problems and bleeding. All
vitamins should be provided in adequate amounts in the diet.

CHAPTER 21
Diet and Cancer
With the improvements in pet health care, many dogs and cats are
living to advanced ages. Cancer has become a relatively common
disease in older pets. There are many different types of cancer with
different biological properties that can affect pets. Both treatment regi
mens and current rutritional status have an impact on nutritional
recommendations, thus there is no ore diet thatis perfect for all cancer
patients.
Cancer Cachexia
Cancer cachexia is a specific term used to describe the involuntary
weight loss that occurs with malignancy. The weight loss associated
with cancer can be severe: fatigue, anemia, and a depletion of both
lean body mass and fat mass occur. Weight loss is clinically significant
as it can affect the quality of life and the prognosis for survival. Patients
may be more prone to toxic effects of chemotherapy.
The cachexia that occurs with cancer can be primary and secondary
Secondary cachexia occurs as a result of the location of the tumor
(interference with intake or ability to digest nutrients) or as a side
effect of cancer treatment. Chemotherapy can alter the sense of smell
and taste in humans and can most likely have the same effect in pets.
Chemotherapy can also directly cause nausea, vomiting, and anorexia.
Both radiation therapy and chemotherapy can destroy the gastrointes
tinal tract cell liring, decreasing food intake and leading to maldiges-
tion and malabsorption of nutrients.
255
256
SECTION 1 NUTRITION AND DIETARY MANAGEMENT
Primary cancer cachexia is a poorly understood syndrome and
carnot be entirely reversed, even with apparently adequate nutritional
intake. Cancer affects the metabolism of the patient, which leads to an
and lean body mass decreases. Metabolism of fat, protein, and carbo-
hydrate is altered. In the early stages of cancer, there may be no
obvious clinical signs, but metabolic changes are already taking place.
During this stage, the arimal may appear normal, may be starting to
slow down, or aging a little more rapidly. At this point, increases in
insulin and lactate are present, and there are alterations in the circulat-
ing concentrations of amino acids. In the second phase of cancer,
patients start to exhibit loss of appetite, lethargy, and weight loss.
During the third phase of cancer, there is further loss of appetite
lethargy, and more profound weight loss. The increases in insulin and
lactate are more pronounced, and there are further alteratiors in amino
acids. There is marked debilitation, with weakness and decreased
body carbohydrate and fat stores, and evidence of a negative nitrogen
balance (decreased circulating albumin). Vomiting and diarrhea may
also occur. The fourth phase of cancer is either recovery or remission.
Metabolic changes may persist, however, even though the patient has
apparently recovered.
Carbohydrate Metabolism
Carbohydrate metabolism is sigrificantly altered in cancer. Tumors
preferentially utilize glucose for energy, which results in an excess of
lactate formation. To convert the excess lactate to a usable form of
   s      
burned, which leads to a net loss of energy. Carbohydrate-rich foods
should be avoided in pets with cancer, as these foods tend to increase
the amount of lactate produced. Carbohydrates should comprise less
than 25% of the dry matter of the diet or less than 20% of the meta-
bolizable energy of the diet (Table 21.1).
Protein Metabolism
decreased protein synthesis, and altered ritrogen balance. Tumors will
use amino acids for growth, and this becomes significant because the
amino acid utilization is greater than amino acid (protein) intake. With

cancers can show a decrease in circulating concentrations of threonine,
glutamine, glycine, valine, cystine, and arginine, and an increase in
isoleucine and phenylalarine. Once these amino acid changes take
place, they do not reverse, even after the tumor is removed, which
suggests that cancer induces long-term metabolic changes.
 Supplementation with branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) may be
beneficial to cancer patients. Branched chain amino acids include iso-
leucine, leucine, and valine. BCAA may help suppress tumor growth.
BCAA may also help prevent lean body wasting and may increase lean
body mass. Leucine, especially, increases protein synthesis in skeletal
muscle. There are no studies evaluating the use of BCAA in dogs or
cats, but supplementation in rodents has been safe at a level of 5% of
the diet. A safe dose for dogs and cats may be 100-200mg/kg/day,
but further studies are needed.
Methiorine and asparagine are required by some tumors for growth.
Replacement of methiorine with homocysteine appears to be benefi-
cial, increasing the sensitivity to chemotherapy. Glycine may decrease
the toxicity of some chemotherapeutic regimens. Arginine and gluta-
mine may have particular benefit. In some studies, the addifion of
arginine decreased tumor growth and the rate of metastases. In dogs
with lymphoma, the circulating concentration of arginine showed a
positive correlation with survival time. Glutamine is an important
source of energy for intestinal cells and can improve Gl function.
Supplementation with glutamine may be beneficial in cancers with
intestinal injury. Glutamine may have suppressive effects on tumor
growth, and it also stimulates the immune system.
In cancer, it is important to avoid a deficiency of protein,
and dietary protein should be provided in excess of healthy adult

dry matter of the diet, or 25%-40% of the metabolizable energy of the
diet. For cats, protein should be provided at 40%-50% of the dry
matter of the diet, 0r 35%-45% of the metabolizable energy of the diet.
Arginine should be provided in the diet at a level greater than 2% on
a dry matter basis.
Lipid Metabolism
Ihe majority of weight loss in cancer is due to the loss of body fat. Not
only is less energy consumed with cancer, but cancer can also result
in an increase in fat breakdown, with a decrease in fat producfion in
the body. Once lipid metabolic changes take place, they do not reverse,
even with treatment or during remission, suggesting that cancer
induces long-term changes in fat metabolism. Diets for pets with
cancer should supply a large proportion of energy from fat. Fat should
supply 25%-40% of dry matter or 50%-60% of the metabolizable
energy of the diet.
There has been a considerable amourt of research focusing on the
effect of omega-3 fatty acids onl cancer. The omega-3 fatty acids are
less inflammatory than are omega-6 fatty acids and thus may be ben-
eficialin the treatment of some cancers. Omega-3 fatty acids, especially
the longest chain omega-3 fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA]
and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]), appear to have the potential to
inhibit the growth of some tumors. In some species, dietary supple
mentation with EPA and DHA can prevent cancer cachexia and can
limit metastasis of some tumors. A possible mecharism of EPA and
DHA in limiting tumor growth and metastasis is that these fatty acids
alter the membrane properties as they are incorporated into tumor
fissue. The omega-3 fatty acids make membranes more fluid and alters
their permeability, which makes tumor cells more susceptible to che-
motherapy and the patient's own immune system. Thus, tumor cells
 a          
of cancer after remission.
Therapeutic trials with omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in
humans have shown significant benefit in cancer, with improvement
in nitrogen balance, better wound healing, and a reduction in the
incidence of complications from therapy In dogs with lymphoma,
supplementation with EPA, DHA, and arginine resulted in a
decrease in circulating lactate. This same supplementation regimen
CHAPTER21DIET AND CANCER259
for dogs with nasal tumors resulted in a decrease in lactate and an
improvement in the quality of life. Diets for cancer should be
designed with increased levels of omega-3 fatty acids (greater than
5% DM), and the omega-6-to-omega-3 fatty acid ratio should be less
than 3.
Vitamins
There are a number of studies that have focused on the effects of dif-
ferent vitamins on tumor growth and metastasis. Vitamin A has the
potential to regulate cancer cells, and some cancers can be treated with
vitamin A derivatives. Vitamin A may make cancer cells more suscep-
tible to treatment. However, since vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin,
it can potentially be toxic if supplemented at high levels.
Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) may be helpful in prevention of cancer of
the stomach and esophagus. In some species, vitamin C can prevent
drug resistance of some cancers to chemotherapy This association has
not been directly shown in dogs or cats, however.
Vitamin E may be helpful in the prevention of mammary and colon
cancer in some species. Vitamin E is a potent antioxidant and can help
prevent oxidative damage that leads to cell death. Vitamin E may
prevent tumor proliferation and augments the immune system. β-
Carotene is an important antioxidant and has been extensively studied
in humars. β-Carotene may be beneficial in some cancers, but other
studies have shown an increased risk of cancer with increased levels
of β-carotene. Thus, more work is needed in pets before a recommen-
dation for β-carotene can be made.
Minerals
Many studies have focused on selerium and its impact on cancer. In
humans, low selerium concentrations have been observed in associa-
tion with gastrointestinal cancer, and in rodents, selerium supplemen-
tation inhibits mammary, stomach, and colon cancers.
Increased iron concentrations have been associated with lung.
colon, bladder, and esophageal cancer in humans. In rodents, low
serum concentrations of iron are associated with slower tumor growth.
Low levels of zinc have been correlated with esophageal, pancreatic,
and bronchial cancer in humans; however, zinc deficiency is associ-
ated with increased cancer in some laboratory animal species.
260SECTION 1 NUTRITION ANDDIETARY MANAGEMENT
Selerium supplementation at 2-4mg/kg body weight/day may be
helpful in pets with neoplasia.
Other Ingredients and Supplements
Phytochemicals are the source of nearly all phenolics found in arimals.
Phenolics essential for animals, such as tyrosine, come either directly
from plants or are modified from essential plant precursors. Phenolic
phytochemicals are grouped into flavonoids (such as anthocyarins,
genistein, and daidzein), tannins, lignins, and simple phenols such as
the benzoic and cirnamic acids. These chemicals protect plants and
have beneficial effects in arimals. They protect arimal cells by chelat-

occurring foods; excess phytochemicals can be toxic.
Soybean products are rich in flavonoids. Other beans are also rich
in phytochemicals. In addition, naturally blue, purple, red, orange,
and yellow foods are abundant in flavonoids. Isolated factors from

Garlic consumption has been associated with a reduced risk of
cancer in some human studies. In rodent models, dietary garlic extracts
have antitumor properties and have a direct effect on human mammary
           
 of dietary garlic in the prevention or treatment of cancer in humans
Or pets.
Green and black teas may also have anticancer properties. The
active agents in these teas act as antioxidants and can inhibit cancer
causing agents. Black tea is soothing and reduces oral discomfort
associated with radiation therapy. Other ingredients in tea, such as

ties when the mouth is rinsed with tea two or three times per day.
Energy Requirements in Cancer Patients
The energy requirement for dogs and cats with cancer can vary from
patient to patient, thus each animal must be evaluated individually
CHAPTER 21DIET AND CANCER  261
and cats with uncomplicated cancer is similar to that of normal healthy
pets. Radiation, chemotherapy, or surgery can affect nutritional status,
depending on the location of the cancer. Cancer therapies do not
appear to increase the energy requirement, but they do interfere with
ingestion or absorption of nutrients, which can lead to nutritional
deficiencies and a loss of weight. Increasing food intake is an impor
tant step in the rutritional treatment of cancer patients.
Enhancing Intake of Food
     si      n s  
nonstressful envirorment for eating. Meals should be given on a
regular schedule, and the person feeding the pet should be calm and
rnonstressful.
The next step to increase the intake of food is to increase the palat-
ability of the diet. Most homemade diets are highly palatable and
should be readily consumed. The increased moisture of homemade
diets helps to increase their intake. Also, the variety of ingredients and
warming of the diet (to no higher than body temperature) can increase
the aroma.
Extra fat can be added to the diet to increase palatability. Additional
  ss e o      e s  
to be consumed to meet daily energy requirements. Adding extra fat
to diets should be avoided in patients with alterations in Gl motility
or in those prone to pancreatitis.
Some increase in dietary protein may also increase palatability. An
increase in protein should be avoided in those with liver disease or
renal failure.
             
the food may increase palatability. Artificial sweeteners should not be
used since they provide no calories. Xylitol, especially, should not be
fed because it can cause a large decrease in the glucose concentration
and can lead to a hypoglycemic crisis. Corn syrup can be used in dogs
to increase sweetmess, but should not be used in cats as it can cause
fructosuria. In general, cats do not respond to sweet tastes since they
 o ns go  s e  's rg sida ns 
syrup should be added, and the supplement should provide less than
10% of the total daily calories. Additional salt sprinkled on the top of
the food may increase palatability in the dog, but cats do not respond
262
SECTION 1 NUTRITION AND DIETARY MANAGEMENT
to extra salt. Salt should not be added to diets for dogs with hyperten-
sion, heart disease, or renal disease.
Despite all the attempts to increase food intake, some patients just
will not consume enough food on their own to meet their daily energy
needs. These patients will require assisted feeding via either a feeding
tube or parenteral nutrition. Assisted feeding should be iritiated early
in the process to prevent severe wasting and nutritional deficiencies.

SECTIONII
Home-Prepared Diets
Tools Needed
1. You will need a good scale to weigh your pet. An accurate body
weight is necessary to determine the kilocalories per day your pet
needs.
 2. A good food scale that can accurately weigh in grams and ounces
is important. This piece of equipment is vital for accurate prepara-
tion of diets.
3. A good set of measuring spoons and measuring cups is necessary.
4. A pill crusher is needed to crush the vitamin and mineral tablets.
A pill splitter is also useful for cutting some tablets in half.
 5. A calculator is helpful to perform the calculations needed to deter-
mine how much diet to feed your pet.
Choosing a Diet
1. Determine the life stage or special conditions that may be present
to choose an appropriate diet. Most diets are complete and bal-
anced; however, some special diets are not, and this is noted in the
recipe. Diets that are rot complete and balanced should orly be fed
under the direct supervision of your veterinarian.
2. Obtain an accurate body weight of your dog or cat.
3. Determine how many calories per day are needed using the tables
in Chapter 4.
265
266 SECTION 2HOME-PREPAREDDIETS
4. Determine how many grams of the chosen recipe should be fed per
day. Divide the kilocalories per day needed by the kilocalories per
gram of the diet.
 5. Prepare the recipe and feed the correct amount to provide adequate
kilocalories.
Let's use an 18-lb adult female spayed dog as an example. This dog
is in good body condition, has no special conditions, and does not need
to lose weight.
1. We will choose the Eggs and Rice diet (p. 284) formulated for adult
dogs.
2. The body weight of the dog is 18lb.
 3. Using Table 4.2, Daily Energy Requirements for Neutered Adult
Dogs, an 18-lb dog requires approximately 542 kilocalories per day.
4. According to the Eggs and Rice adult diet, this recipe as prepared
makes approximately 693g of diet and provides a total of 1066kcal.
Thus, this is a 1066kcal/693g diet, or a 1.54kcal/g diet.
If this dog needs 542kcal/day, then how many grams of this diet
should be fed per day? Divide the kilocalories per day needed by the
1.54 kcal;g diet
As another example, let's use a 55-lb intact male dog. This dog is in
good body condition, has no special conditions, and does not need to
lose weight.
1. Choose the Chicken and Rice diet (p. 277) formulated for adult dogs.
2. The body weight of the dog is 55lb.
3. Using Table 4.1, Daily Energy Requirements for Intact Adult Dogs,
4. According to the Chicken and Rice adult diet, this recipe as pre-
pared makes approximately 459g of diet and provides a total of
726kcal. Thus, this is 726kcal/459g diet, 0r 1.58kcal/g diet.
Divide the kilocalories per day rneeded by the kilocalories per gram
of diet.
1.58 kcal/g diet
SECTION 2 HOME-PREPAREDDIETS 267
5. One batch of this recipe makes orly 459g of diet. This dog needs
more than this amount, so double the recipe. Multiply all ingredi-
ents by 2 to make a double batch, that is, 4 cups cooked rice, 8
Ounces cooked chicken breast, etc.
Preparing Diets
1. Follow the recipes as written and do NOT omit or substitute ingre-
dients. These diets have been carefully formulated to meet the
rutritional needs of dogs or cats. This is especially important for
the vitamin/mineral supplements included in the recipes.
 2. Ingredients should be cooked as stated in the recipe prior to prepa-
ration. Recipes were formulated using the nutritional value pro-
vided by cooked ingredients.
 3. Chop ingredients into small pieces so that ingredients can be well
mixed. Any vitamins or minerals provided in tablet form should be
crushed before adding them to the diet.
4. Orly prepare as much diet as you will feed your pet in a day Store
unused portions either in the refrigerator (for no longer than 1 day)
or in the freezer. These diets do not contain any preservatives, and
bacteria can easily grow in these diets if left at room temperature.
5. Diets should be fed at room temperature. If ingredients are cold,
palatability is decreased and the pet may not consume adequate
diet. Diets can be slightly warmed to increase palatability if needed,
but diets should NOT be heated until hot as this can destroy some
of the vitamins present.
6. Small amounts of vegetables (less than 1/2 cup) can be added to
most diets. Vegetables will increase the fiber content and decrease
the caloric density of the diet. If vegetables are added, make sure
that the pet consumes all of the diet necessary to provide adequate
caloric and nutrient intake
