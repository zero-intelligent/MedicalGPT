pulse is initiated in the SA node, spreads through internodal pathways to the AV node,and en-
ters the ventricles through the bundle branches. B. Complete AV block as a result of anatomic
dissociation of the atria and ventricles.Sinus node impulses result in atrial activation (14）,but
all impulses are blocked in the AVnodal region.The ventricle is activated by a ventricular escape
focus (5).C.PhysiologicAV block because the AV node is refractory to rapid impulse informa-
tion in the atria. The atria are activated by an ectopic atrial pacemaker (atrial tachycardia) or cir-
cuit movement (atrial flutter). Most atrial impulses arrive at the AV node when the node is re-
fractory owing to partial conduction of previous impulses (concealed conduction). Most impulses
are blocked (1-3,3-8),with only an occasional impulse (4) conducted to the ventricles.This type
of dissociation is a normal response of the AV node to rapid atrial activation.An additional P
wave occurs simultaneously with QRS,but is omitted for purposes of clarity.D.AV dissociation
secondary to ventricular tachycardia.An ectopic ventricular focus rapidly activates the ventricle,
resulting in abnormal QRs-T complexes (1-5).Sinoatrial impulses are blocked (6-8) owing to
interference in the AV junctional region. The primary abnormality is increased ventricular auto-
maticity.SA, sinoatrial; AV,atrioventricular.

Classification and ClinicialAssociationsof Common Arrhythmias
Sinus Rhythms
Normal sinus rhythm:A normal rhythm; can be associated with abnormal conduction
Sinus arrhythmia:Normal rhythm;often with wandering atrial pacemaker
Sinus bradycardia:Increased vagal tone;elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure;brain stem lesions;head
trauma;gastrointestinal disease;neurocardiogenic syncope (e.g,in dilated cardiomyopathy of dogs);
hypothermia;hypothyroidism;hyperkalemia;administration of beta-blockers,digitalis,or inhalation
anesthetics; primary sinus node dysfunction in breeds at risk for sick sinus syndrome
Sinus tachycardia: Increased sympathetic tone; fear;excitement;pain;hypovolemia;hypotension; ane
mia;heart failure;hyperthyroidism; administration of vagolytic drugs such as atropine,or sympath
omimetics
Sinus arrest:Sick sinus syndrome,high vagal tone;digitalis,surgical manipulation; can alternate with
supraventricular tachycardia in sick sinus syndrome; over-administration of anesthetic or antiarrhyth-
mic drugs:dysautonomia
Atrial Arrhythmias
Atrial premature complexes:Atrial dilatation,atrioventricular valve regurgitation; cardiomyopathy;
hyperthyroidism: congenital heart diseases; chronic pulmonary disease;hypoxia;anemia; digitalis in-

·Junctional premature complexes: Originate in the AV junctional perinodal) tissues;causes are proba-
bly similar to those causingatrial premature complexes
·Junctional (automatic) tachycardia: Often associated with atrioventricular dissociation; causes include
digitalis intoxication,myocarditis,electrolyte imbalance and potentially causes of atrial premature
complexes

node or the presence of an accessory pathway;breed predisposition in Labrador retrievers;associated

Chronic Diarrhea
Easily or Rapidly Diagnosed Diarrhea
1.Dietary diarrhea (food hypersensitivity,dietary indiscretion）is usually self-limiting with dietary re-
striction or trial feeding of a controlled diet.
2.Drug-induced diarrhea resolves with dosage reduction or discontinuation of the drug.
3.Parasitic diarrhea is diagnosed by identification of ova,larvae,or trophozoites in the feces and by the
animal'sresponse to parasiticidal drugs.
4.Nonenteric causes of diarrhea, such asliver disease,renal failure (increased BUN and creatinine）.or
hypoadrenocorticism (hyperkalemia and hyponatremia),are often identified by serum biochemistry
profiles and urinalysis.
5.Thyroid palpation and measurement of serum thyroxine(Ta) levels indicate hyperthyroid-related di
arrhea in aged cats.
Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency
1.Severe steatorrhea (positive Sudan stain for unsplit fat,excessive quantitative fecal fat excretion)
2.Amylorrhea (positive iodine stain for undigested starch)
3.Lack of plasma turbidity after oral fat load (corrected with enzymes)
4.Normal xylose absorption (unless there is secondary mucosal injury or bacterial overgrowth)
5.Abnormal oral bentiromide (BT-PABA) digestion test
6.Very low serum trypsin-likeimmunoreactivity assay
7.Responsive to oral pancreatic enzyme therapy
Intestinal Malabsorption
1.Steatorrhea （positive Sudan stain for split fat,increased quantitative fecal fat excretion)
2.Flat xylose absorption curve
3.Normal pancreatic function tests
4.Nonspecific infiltrative lesions of the bowel wall detected on barium upper GI radiography (in some
cases)
5.Abnormal serum levels of folate andvitamin Bin some cases
6.Decreased brush border enzyme activities measured by specialized assays
7.Histopathologic lesions detected on biopsy of smallintestine
8.Response to therapeutic trials: d/d Prescription Diet (lymphocytic-plasmacytic enterocolitis）:metro-
nidazole(occult giardiasis);tetracycline (bacterial overgrowth)

Protein-Losing Enteropathies

3.Most fiber tracts in the spinal cord

clinical signs.

injury.
5.An injury's severity helps determine
clinical signs because of the difference in
susceptibility to injury among fiber types
in the spinal cord.Larger,more myeli-
nated fibers are more susceptible to injury
than smaller, less myelinated fibers. The
proprioceptive fibers are the most suscep-
tible to injury,themotorfibers are second
in susceptibility,and pain fibers are the
least susceptible to injury.

used as a supplement to imipramine.
3) Dextroamphetamine:

the dose to clinical efficacy. This drug is
also used as a supplement to imipramine.
8.Prognosis
A.The disease is not fatal, so the
prognosis for life is good.Many of the an-
imals with theinherited form (Dobermans
and Labradors) improve with age.
B. The prognosis is more variable in
terms of client satisfaction, as the disease
is not curable,and even with rigorous
therapy,many patients remain symp-
tomatic.In addition,many patients de-
velop drug tolerance, so the therapeutic
regimen has to be changed as it becomes
ineffective.A final concern is that therapy
may be expensive.
