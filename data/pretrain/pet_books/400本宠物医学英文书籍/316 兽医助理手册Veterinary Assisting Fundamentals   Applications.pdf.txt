and Greek words. Learning how to break down a term
to define the meaning is the key to learning this new
language. Some words may seem long and complex, but
working with each part of the word will create a structure
 for learning terminology. Veterinary assistants should
also have a veterinary dictionary to verify spelling and
definitions of new words that may be encountered.

the following directional terms: A = cranial, B = caudal,
C = ventral, D = dorsal, E = rostral, F = proximal, G =
distal, H = palmer, I = plantar.
Directional terms relate to the body position and are
useful in recording locations relating to the body; they
are also useful in surgical or radiographic positioning.
These terms relate to a specific area on the body of an
animal and allow for better communication when refer-

This allows others to properly identify and communicate

Each patient record should contain one medical re-

facility that treats large animals and farm production
systems, one chart may be used for the entire herd as
long as each animal treated is identified by a tag number
or registration number to determine which animals have
been examined and treated by the veterinarian. Labora-

a similar fashion and may have regulations outlined by

When recording information in the medical record,
some facilities use a format called SOAP. This stands
for Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan. The
subjective information is information that is based on
the animal's overall appearance and the health care
team's descriptions of the animal. This may include the
 animal's attitude and the veterinary assistant's feelings
on the appearance of the pet. The objective informa-

on the patient. This includes the vital signs, such as
temperature, heart rate, and weight. The assessment
of the patient is what the veterinarian determines to
be the diagnosis or the patient's problem. The plan is
the treatment or procedure that is to be given to the
patient. The SOAP is commonly used in the progress
notes and the physical examination section of the med-
ical records.

will see a certain number of patients within an hour.
It is important for employees who schedule appointments
to be trained and knowledgeable in common medical con-
ditions so they are able to determine approximately how
long the veterinarian will need to be with the patient. If
it is believed the appointment may go over the scheduled
interval, it is good practice to confirm this with the at-
tending veterinarian to gain approval to schedule the ap-
pointment and allow more or less time accordlingly.

Tattoos and body piercings should be kept concealed,
and some facilities may have regulations against these

employees should be listed in the hospital manual and

image that the entire hospital portrays. Remember,
first impressions are lasting impressions. Clients will
judge the staff based on their appearance.
The Veterinary Facility
The veterinary hospital is composed of multiple sections
and locations where different veterinary medical proce-
dures and functions are completed. The front entrance
typically leads into the veterinary waiting room and
reception area (see Figure 5-8]. This is the area where
clients wait to see the vet and are greeted and signed in
by the front office staff.
The exam room is where patients receive routine
exams. There may be one or more exam rooms depend-
ing on the size of the facility and the number of veteri-
narians on staff [see Figure 5-9)].
The treatment area, sometimes called the prep
area, is a location in the hospital where patients are

CHAPTER 6 Communication and Client Relations

The Communication Process
The communication process has five essential compo-
nents: the sender, the message, the channel, the receiver,
and the feedback (see Figure 6-1]. The process begins with
the sender, the person trying to relay an idea. This idea is
called the message. The message is sent by the sender
to another person called the receiver. The receiver is the
is sent through a channel, which is the chosen route of
communication. Examples of routes of communication in-
clude verbal, nonverbal, and written. Once this process of
communication is complete the receiver may return a mes-
 sage called feedback. This process is continued until the
conversation is complete. Communication is a way of pass-
ing along information from one person to another or to a
group of people.
Verbal Communication
FIcuRE 6-2 Verbal communication plays a large role in
the duties of the veterinary assistant.
Verbal communication is spoken words used between
two or more people to form an understanding. Verbal
communication is the most common form of commu-
nication between people. This type of communication
is needed between the veterinary assistant and other
staff members, as well as with clients [see Figure 6-2].
It is important to be able to speak well to other peo-
ple. Verbal communication in medicine can now also
mean recording notes on tape recorders to be written
at a later date, allowing for more accurate notes.
Nonverbal Communication
Nonverbal communication is interaction between
people without the use of spoken words. This may
be through body language and physical expressions.

it may cause shock and frustration, but it is best to
remain calm. There is no exact method for dealing
with an angry person. It is best to begin by asking the
person what the problem or situation may be. Ask for
an explanation of what happened. Many times, if an

Veterinary Ethics
Ethics are rules that govern proper conduct. Veterinary
ethics dictate the moral conduct of veterinarians and
their professional staff members. These morals indicate
what a person believes as right and wrong. The AVMA
has set standards in veterinary medical ethics. The most
important responsibility of the veterinary staff is to put
the patient's needs first and relieve any suffering and
pain in animals. When these obligations are fulfilled, it
is considered to be ethical. When these obligations are
not completed, then it is considered to be unethical.
Listed below are some examples of unethical practices
in veterinary medicine:
 Not following the laws pertaining to the Practice Act
■
Misrepresentation as a veterinarian (not licensed
but working as a vet)
■ Slander—speaking negatively of other veterinary
professionals
· Violating confidentiality
■Practicing below the standards of patient care

 Document everything in the medical record.
■ Have every client sign a consent form with listed
procedures and give estimates to all clients.
■ Lock all windows, doors, and drug cabinets.
 Provide leashes and carriers for all small pets.
Animal restraint shouldlegallybe performed by
only trained staff members.
Keep animals separate.
■Use ID cards and neck bands on all hospitalized

■Check all areas of the hospital for safety hazards
on a daily basis.
 Post signs that warn clients of possible hazards.
 Suggest that any complaints be made to the State

Biology
Dogs were bred from wolves and were domesticated
over 10,000 years ago. Domestication means that
the animal has become tame and is bred to be near
humans for companionship. The canine can be de-
scribed by its genus and species known as Canis fa-
miliaris. This identifies it as a relative of the wolf. Dogs
are mammals that are known as carnivores, or meat
eaters. They are able to regulate their body tempera-
ture internally in the same manner as humans and are
thus called endothermic animals. Dogs have a simple
stomach digestive system called monogastric. Dogs
are built for specific uses and purposes and are cat-
egorized by size, weight, age, and coat type. They also

food should be fed several times a day and the puppy
 allowed food for 15 minutes. This will teach the puppy
to learn to eat at scheduled times. As the puppy grows,
it should be fed twice a day. Sometimes breeders will
deal with orphaned puppies due to the mother refusing
to nurse, illness, or death. In the case of a puppy that is
orphaned, a specialized formula diet is necessary. Exam-
ples of commercial formulas include Esbilac and KMR
[see Figure 8-5]. A homemade formula can be prepared
as well, but a specific commercial high-quality puppy

Feeding Adult Dogs
Adult dogs should ideally be fed a dry food diet to help
prevent tartar buildup on teeth. The food size should be
appropriate for the size of the dog. It is best to feed a
high-quality pet food that is easily digestible. Examples
of high-quality dog foods are Eukanuba, lams, Purina,
Purina One, and Nestle.

care. Dogs see prolonged staring or direct eye contact
as threatening. Quick movements from people can also
cause a negative reaction. Large numbers of people
can be intimidating to a dog. Restrainers should move
slowly, calmly, talk quietly, and avoid eye contact with
any nervous animal. Knowledge of dog behavior and
body language is essential to a veterinary assistant
for use in safe and adequate restraint skills. As a re-
strainer, the veterinary assistant has the ability to influ-
ence the behavior of the animals he or she is working
with. Each situation and patient should be monitored
carefully to prevent injury to the handler, the patient,
and others involved in working with the animal. Some-

mal, such as the words NO, SIT, or DOwN. Chemical
restraint is the use of sedatives or tranquilizers to calm
the animal to allow procedures to be done.
TermInOlOGy Tip
A sedative or tranquilizer is a type of
medication used to calm an animal and
prevent it from moving. It is important to
note, however, that these medications may
not relieve pain sensations.
Physical Restraint
There are several common physical restraints that may
be used for dogs. These include sitting and standing re-
straint techniques as well as placing the dog in recum-
bency positions. Standing restraint may be used on the
floor or on a table. One arm is placed around the neck to
control the head. This is called the bear-hug. The other
arm is placed under the stomach to prevent sitting and

and back and another person can restrain the rear of

Dorsal recumbency is when the dog is positioned
on its back, commonly used in X-ray positioning. The
dog is placed in lateral recumbency and then carefully
rolled onto its back. Two or more people should be re-
straining the head, middle of the body, and the rear of
the body. The front legs are pulled forward toward the
head of the dog and the rear limbs are pulled backward
toward the tail (see Figure 8-16].
Cephalic venipuncture is blood collection from the 
cephalic vein located on the inside of the front legs. The
 dog is typically placed in sitting or sternal recumbency
and a front leg is extended for the blood collection [see
Figure 8-17]. Some vets and technicians will ask the re-
 strainer to hold off the vein by placing pressure around 
the elbow of the dog.
Jugular venipuncture is blood collection from the
jugular vein located on either side of the neck. The com-
mon restraints are sitting or sternal recumbency (see
Figure 8-18). For smaller dogs, the front limbs can be
extended over the edge of a table to allow more space
to collect the blood sample.
Saphenous venipuncture is blood collection from
the inside of the thigh in the rear limbs. Dogs are com-
monly placed in lateral recumbency and the restrainer

 may be asked to hold off the pressure around the upper
thigh area of the rear limb (see Figure 8-19].
Lifting Techniques
Lifting dogs requires safety for both the restrainers and
the animal. when lifting any sized dog, a restrainer
should always keep his or her back straight and bend
at the knees. This will help prevent any back injuries.
 Small dogs may be lifted by supporting the front and

are come in various sizes to fit the size of the dog.
The muzzle should provide a snug fit. The short side
of the muzzle should be on top of the dog's nose and
the wide side should be placed under the jaw. The
snap goes behind the ear flaps and snaps securely in
place (see Figure 8-21, A-B]. The dog's legs should be

require two or more people. One person should con-
trol the head and one or more will need to control the
rear of the body. Lifting should occur with pressure on
the abdomen and chest area. It is important for two or
more people to always work on the same side of the
dog. Teamwork involves communication to indicate to
each other when to lift.

properly restrained to prevent removing the muzzle.
When applying the muzzle, note that for safety, the
restrainer should stand at the side or the rear of the
animal. Never work directly in front of the dog. A tape
or gauze muzzle can be used if a commercial muzzle is
not available. Make sure to use an adequate amount
of material that will fit the dog. Gauze is thin material
that may come on a roll and is made of a mesh-like
cotton. Gauze material should be heavy to prevent
tearing. Tape should be folded upon itself to prevent
glue from attaching to the dog's hair or skin. Begin

and secured as in tying a shoelace. Pull tight and cross
ends snugly under the jaw and tie in a knot under the
jaw. Take each end on either side of the ears and tie
in a bow behind the ear flaps (see Figure 8-22, A-C].
[A]
When removing the muzzle, release the bow and gen-
tly pull off the muzzle [see Figure 8-23]. If the dog is
likely to try biting, untie or unsnap the muzzle and al-
low the dog to remove it. Dogs that have a flat face
lacking a long muzzle, such as pugs or Bulldogs, are
called brachycephalic. These breeds are prone to dif-
ficulty breathing. Care must be taken when muzzling
these breeds. A tape or gauze muzzle can be placed
over the nose and one end looped under the mate-
rial and pulled tight. Both ends are pulled between
the eyes and over the head and tied securely in a bow
around the nape of the neck.
Use of a Rabies or Snare Pole
[B)
A restraint device used to remove aggressive dogs from
a cage is called the rabies pole or snare pole. The pole
is a long extension with a heavy loop on the end that is
adjusted by sliding the pole handle [see Figure 8-24].
It acts as a leash to walk the dog or control the dog to
be properly restrained. Once the loop is over the head,
the dog should be guided forward with the restrainer
behind the dog. Do not choke the animal by pulling it.
Care must be used in this type of restraint to avoid in-
jury to the dog.
Use of Sedation
 Some dogs that are too aggressive to handle safely may
be sedated for the safety of the veterinary staff. Seda-
tion is used to calm down a dog and allow it to safely

be restrained. The use of sedation must be prescribed
by the veterinarian and should be used as a final resort

Brushing
It is best to routinely brush the hair coat of a dog on
a daily to weekly basis. This will keep the hair coat
healthy. Long-haired breeds may develop mats, which
are tangled pieces of hair. Mats may need to be trimmed
or shaved. Some long-haired breeds will require daily
brushing. It is important to know how to properly care
for the hair coat based on the breed of the dog. Some
breeds will require regular bathing, while bathing oth-
ers too often may cause damage to the hair coat.
Basic Health Care
and Maintenance
FIcurE 8-35 Tools required to clean a dog's ears.
Each year a dog should be seen by the veterinarian for
a physical examination (PE). This exam will help deter-
mine the health status of the dog and if any illnesses or
conditions are developing. Dogs require daily exercise,
and some breeds will require more activity than others.
Regular maintenance should include nail trimming [NT],
ear cleaning, anal gland expression, and teeth brushing.
Ear Cleaning
Dogs should have their ears checked and cleaned as nec-
essary. Some breeds will need more cleaning than oth-
ers. This will help maintain breeds that are prone to ear
infections. Ears can be cleaned with cotton balls, cotton-
tipped applicators, or gauze pads (see Figure 8-35]. Cau-
tion should be used with applicators since the wooden
sticks can break off and become trapped in the ear ca-
nal. The veterinary assistant should clean only as far

some knowledge of the nail anatomy and practice at
clipping. Veterinary assistants should be able to use
handheld nail trimmers as well as a dremel tool that
grinds down nails (see Figure 8-38]. The nail bed has
a blood supply known as the quick. If a nail is trimmed
too short, it will start to bleed. There are several ways
to clot or stop the bleeding. A veterinary assistant may
use a special powder that clots the blood called styp-
tic powder (see Figure 8-39]. If the bleeding is difficult
to control, a silver nitrate stick may be used. This is
a chemical that burns the blood vessel and causes the
blood to clot. Clients who trim their dog's nails at home
may use corn starch, flour, or a bar of soap packed into
the bleeding nail. If the nail is cut or torn very short a
bandage may be necessary.

to be pulled out. This is done in certain dog breeds that
have excessive amounts of hair within the ear canal. The
poodle is one such breed. The growth of hair within the 
ear canal can cause irritation and hold in dirt and de-
bris. Plucking of the hair can prevent dirt and wax from
collecting in the ear canal.
Expression of Anal Glands
Anal glands are the scent glands located on either
side of the rectum (see Figure 8-40]. The scent glands

Smelling each other's scent glands is the way dogs greet

trained to express anal glands externally. This procedure
is done with the dog standing. Exam gloves should be
worn and paper towels and a bowl of warm soapy wa-
ter should be available for cleanup. The external method
of expressing anal glands is to locate the sacs on either
side of the rectum; as if on a face of a clock, the glands
are located at the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions. Us-
ing the thumb and pointer finger gently apply pressure
to the sac area by massaging the site [see Figure 8-41].
The sacs should press against each other and release
the fluid. Be warned not to stand directly behind the dog
when performing this procedure. The glands tend to re-
lease and spray an odorous fluid that can be projected
several feet. If the glands become impacted or difficult
to express due to thickening, a veterinarian or veteri-
nary technician will need to express the glands internally.

The DHLPPC is given in boosters, or multiple times,

ending around 16 weeks of age. A rabies vaccine (RV] is
given between 12 and 16 weeks of age and is valid for
1 year; there are some rabies vaccines that are good for
1 year and some that will protect for 3 years. The rabies
vaccine must legally be given to any owned dog. A ra-
bies tag and a proof of certificate is issued at the time
the vaccine is given. These vaccines are commonly given
into a muscle or intramuscular (IM) or under the skin
known as subcutaneous (SQ). Some veterinarians may
suggest other vaccines against diseases common to the
area, such as Lyme disease or kennel cough.

Breeds
Over 30 breeds of cats are recognized by the Cat
Fanciers' Association (CFA) (Table 9-2). The CFA is a
breed registry that promotes the health and respon-
sible breeding of cats. Cats that are not registered and
have unknown parentage are usually called domes-
tics [see Figure 9-5]. There are a variety of different
hair coat types but most cats are distinguished by ei-
ther long hair or short hair appearances. Shorthair
breeds tend to be low maintenance. Longhair breeds
are high maintenance and require daily brushing and
routine grooming. Longhair breeds are more suscep-
tible to hairballs, which are clumps of hair ingested
from grooming that build up and collect in the diges-
tive tract. Hairballs can cause obstructions and can be-

Kittens that may be orphaned should be fed a
commercial formula, such as KMR or goat's milk. Kittens
require 30 mL per pound body weight daily and can be
fed three to four feedings a day until 4 weeks of age.
Kittens may be fed with a nurser bottle or a syringe [see
Figure 9-7]. A daily weight should be recorded to deter-
mine that the kitten is growing. Kittens should be placed
the first 2 weeks of life [see Figure 9-8]. Between 4-5
weeks of age, kittens can begin eating a soft solid kitten
food diet. The diet can be softened using warm water,
if needed.

the nutrient needs of both species are very different.
Cats require a high-protein and high-fat diet with the
added nutrients of taurine and thiamine. High-protein
diets are necessary since cats break down protein very
slowly. Taurine is necessary for proper development
and body system functions. Thiamine is a compound
of Vitamin B that promotes a healthy coat. Cat foods
are available in dry, semi-moist, and moist forms. Cats
should not be given milk as it upsets the digestive sys-
tem and causes diarrhea.
FlGUrE 9-7 Orphaned kittens can be fed formula using a

syringe.
Kittens require colostrum from the mother in the
first 24 hours after birth. This will protect them from
diseases until vaccines begin. They will nurse from the
queen for 3 weeks. Around 3 to 4 weeks of age kittens
should be offered canned or moist food. Over the next
 2 weeks they should begin dry food that is moistened
with warm water. By 6-8 weeks of age the kittens
should be weaned and on solid kitten food. The feed-
ings should be divided into several times a day. It is
important when feeding a dry kitten food to feed a size-
appropriate diet. Kitten dietary requirements include
the following:
■ Protein needs—35-50%
■Fat needs-17-35%
Kitten energy needs are identified as follows:
■ 2 months of age—175 kcal/day
■ 3 months of age—260 kcal/day

Senior cats should be fed a senior diet that is reduced in
 calories. Overweight cats should be fed a weight manage-
ment diet. Adult cats should be fed twice daily. Some spe-
cialized cat foods to consider are tartar control to prevent
buildup on the teeth and hairball formula diets to aid in
digesting hairballs in the digestive tract. Adult cats on a
maintenance diet require around 280 kcal/day. Pregnant
queens should be fed ad lib or as much as they want with
food available at all times during the last 20 days of ges-
tation. This can continue post-queening until the kittens
begin weaning. During weaning, the queen should have
her food reduced by V4 rations until the ideal amount is
reached. This will allow lactation to stop.
FIGURE 9-9 The happy cat.
Behavior
Cats have many natural instincts that they inherited
from wild cats. Cats have developed hunting skills, mark-
ing behaviors, purring traits, and social skills from their
ancestors. The domestication of the cat has added in
the companionship factor. Similar to the dog, cats have
three distinct behaviors. Each of these behaviors is dis-
played in the cat's body language, and most cats will

Cats are quick and agile and a cat can bite or scratch in
an instant. Cats may be restrained using physical, ver-
bal, chemical, or a combination of methods. One item
that is helpful when handling a cat is the use of a towel.
Cats feel less threatened when they are hiding under a
towel and the towel can serve as a barrier if the cat be-
comes difficult to handle [see Figure 9-12]. A towel can

used to wrap the cat in a "kitty taco." The kitty taco is
made by placing a towel on a table and placing the cat
on the towel. The sides of the towel are wrapped around
the cat to contain the legs and body (see Figure 9-13].
The head is left outside the towel and gives the appear-

Basic Training
Cats should be litter trained to use a litter box. This

Equipment and Housing
Needs
FlcurE 9-12 A towel can be used to help calm and control

Cats should have a food and water bowl located in the
household. Other equipment that is recommended for
cat owners includes the following:
■Carrier
■Litter pans
 Litter
■ Scratching post
■Toys
Restraint and Handling
The most important factor to consider when handling a
cat is to avoid being bitten or scratched. Cats can cause
severely infected bites and scratches; therefore, care
must be taken when restraining a cat. Veterinary assis-

necessary.
Another way to control a cat is with the use of a cat
bag. The cat bag is similar to the kitty taco, but also
allows access to the limbs or parts of the body. The cat
is placed in a bag that has zippers to allow access to
parts of the cat's body to perform certain procedures
[see Figure 9-14]. This allows better control of the head
and legs to prevent injury.
Cat muzzles are similar to dog muzzles. They are
the eyes, nose, and mouth. A small hole at the end of
the nose area allows for breathing. Cats relax better
when they are not able to see anything. They feel a
sense of security. The cat muzzle is fashioned similar to
a dog muzzle in which the top of the muzzle is shorter
than the bottom. Cat muzzles are closed with a Velcro

The FVRCP is given in boosters once a month for
3-4 times until the kitten reaches 16 weeks of age. A rabies
vaccine is given at 16 weeks of age. All vaccines are then
good for one year. Some veterinarians may suggest other
vaccines against feline diseases, such as the Feline Leuke-
mia or Feline Infectious Peritonitis. The feline leukemia vac-
cine, or FeLv, is given at 12 weeks of age and requires one
booster in 3-4 weeks and is then given annually.
Reproduction and Breeding

they have multiple heat cycles during a season. Typically,

Panleukopenia
Panleukopenia is also known as "feline distemper." This
is a systemic virus that affects the cat by causing a de-
creased white blood cell count. It is transmitted through
urine, feces, and direct contact. In kittens it is usually
fatal. There is a vaccine available to prevent the disease.
Signs of feline panleukopenia include the following:
Vomiting
· Diarrhea
 Depression
● Dehydration
Anorexia
 Seizures
● Death
Rhinotracheitis
Rhinotracheitis is also a virus that affects the upper
respiratory tract of cats. It is spread through direct con-
tact of saliva and nasal discharges. The disease typically
runs a 2-4 week course until signs begin to improve.
A vaccine is available for prevention. Signs of feline
rhinotracheitis include the following:

Common Surgical Procedures
Veterinary assistants will routinely discuss feline surgi-
cal procedures with cat owners. Several canine surgical
procedures were discussed in "Canine Production
Management," such as the ovariohysterectomy (spay],
castration, and declaw surgery. These surgical proce-
dures are common in cats, as well. The procedures are

Birds are capable of living long life spans. Some

Birds reproduce by laying eggs.
The skeletal system of birds is somewhat similar to
other companion animals. The two legs of birds act as

birds but can become problematic in captive birds.
Biting
Biting is also a defensive behavior. It is a way in the
wild to test trees for perching and capturing food. In
captivity, biting is a way for a bird to get attention (see
Figure 10-20]. This can lead to further aggression if not 
handled properly.
Birds that bite should be handled cautiously. When
they are perched on a hand and try to bite, one method
to teach them that biting is not acceptable is a tech-
nique called the "earthquake." This is done by hold-
ing the thumb over the toes to prevent the bird from
moving up the arm or having too much freedom dur-
ing handling. When the bird tries to bite, the handler
quickly and carefully shakes the hand while holding on
to the feet. The loss of balance causes the bird to be
distracted. At the same time the handler should say a

picking may not be possible. E-collars, or Elizabethan col-
lars, similar to those used in dogs and cats, may be placed
on the neck area of birds to control feather picking. Some
birds may become so destructive in picking their feathers
that they may begin traumatizing their own skin, causing
open sores that could become infected.
Equipment and Housing Needs
All birds will require a cage. The cage provided should
be as large as possible (see Table 10-6]. Cages should
be wider than they are tall to accommodate the bird's
flying and natural movements. Perches should be pro-
vided in the cage and should be of various heights and
widths. Newspaper is an appropriate floor material for
the cage. Nothing that will be toxic or harmful to the
bird should be used as flooring. The cage should be
placed in an area of the house where the bird will be
around its owner and free of drafts. Toys can be pro-

cause severe injuries. It is always a good idea to have

Birds' beaks continue to grow in the same fashion
as the nails. Birds will require a beak trim based on
their size and type of foods in their diet. It is important
to make sure the beak tips do not overlap or grow into
each other as this will prevent birds from eating prop-
erly. Beaks should be maintained using a dremel tool to
grind down the edges of the beak [see Figure 10-26].
The dremel tool is an instrument that is used to grind
down beaks and smooth the tip from becoming sharp
and overgrown. This allows for smooth edges that can
be shaped into the natural lines of the beak. The sharp
point of the tip of the beak should be rounded to pre-
vent injuries to the bird, reduce damage in the house,
and reduce injuries to people handling the bird.

Basic Health Care and
Maintenance
Birds require several necessities to be healthy and
stress free. Birdls do not adlapt well to stress or change,
and they should have a constant environment. They
should have a cage that is at least 1%2 times the wing-
span of the bird. Several perches should be included in
the cage in areas where droppings will not contaminate
the food and water sources. Birds should be given toys
with bright colors to keep them stimulated and from
becoming bored. Birds that are bored tend to develop
behavioral problems. Cages should be maintained and
monitored especially when several perches or large
amounts of toys are provided. It is not uncommon for
birds to injure themselves on items within the cage.

wish to breed research the type of avian they own and
learn as much as possible about the reproduction needs
and cycle of the bird. Some female birds will require diet
supplements that increase the calcium intake to allow
for egg production.

Mice and Rats
Mice and rats are curious and friendly pocket pets. They
are usually tame animals, especially when acquired at
a young age. The younger the rodent, the easier it is to
tame. The best way to tame a rodent is by hand-feeding
it. Both rats and mice can be trained to do tricks. Many
times these animals are used in research and nutritional
studies. Unfortunately, both have received a nega-
tive reputation from their wild ancestors, which cause
damage and spread disease.
Veterinary Terminology
[A)

murine = mouse or rat
sire = intact male mouse or rat
dam = intact female mouse or rat
pup = young mouse or rat
Biology
Rats and mice typically live an average lifespan of
1-3 years. Rats and mice are in the family Rodentia
and the veterinary term that refers to mice and rats
is murine (see Figure 11-2]. Rats and mice have poor
vision but a well-developed sense of smell. Species that
have red- or pink-colored eyes have reduced vision.

sit in the hand and be easily held. If they are not han-
dled a lot or used to people, they do have a tendency to
bite. Rats and mice should never be touched or picked
up when they are sleeping. Rats should be handled by
the body and never picked up by the tail. The tail can
be “stripped" of its skin or broken if used to pick up the
rat. When the body is secure, grasp the rat by the tail
base and place on a firm surface. Then, with the op-
posite hand, encircle the body over the shoulder and
neck region. It is necessary to perform this maneuver
expeditiously, or the rat may turn and bite. Do not grip
the chest so tightly that respiration is hindered. Once
the head and body are secured, the rat may be lifted

Common Parasites
Mice and rats may commonly develop external para-
sites such as fleas, fur mites, and lice. The signs of
external parasites include hair loss, itching, and occa-
sional scratches on the skin from the claws. Rats and
mice may also be affected by internal parasites, such as
tapeworms and protozoans, similar to those parasites
that affect dogs and cats. Fecal analysis and treatment
with deworming medications is necessary. It is impor-
tant that products used to treat internal and external
parasites are labeled for use in mice and rats.

Hamsters' average lifespan is 18 to 24 months. They
are best kept alone and are naturally solitary animals.
Breeds
Hamsters come in a variety of coat types and colors. The
Syrian hamster, also called the Golden hamster or teddy
bear hamster, is one of the most popular breeds of pet
hamsters (see Figure 11-11]. They may reach sizes as
large as 5 inches in body length. The Chinese hamster
is smaller in size and most often used as a research spe-
cies. Several variations and mixtures of the breeds have
been developed for different color characteristics and
size variations. Dwarf hamsters are small in size and
may be an inch in size or smaller (see Figure 11-12].

Hamsters eat about %/2 ounce of food a day. They should
be fed in the evenings when they are most active. Most
commercial feeds include a variety of seeds, grains, and
cereals with common ingredients being corn, oats,
and wheat. They enjoy treats and will often store food
and treats into their cheek pouches, as a storage area
to then burrow or tunnel the food items for later use
[see Figure 11-13]. It is common for hamsters to burrow
food in an area of their cage.
Behavior
Hamsters should be housed in areas where the temper-
ature is between 60 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. This is
due to the hamsters' instinct to hibernate if the tem-
perature goes below 45 degrees. Hibernation is a natu-
ral condition where the animal goes into a long sleep
and the body systems will slow down until temperatures
rise. If this occurs, it is best to slowly warm the hamster
and when awake offer it warm milk until it revives.
Basic Training
Training a hamster is similar to training rats and mice.
They can be trained with consistency, proper handling,
and using food as treats. Training a young hamster be-
tween 4 and 7 weeks of age will be easier than an older
animal. Hamsters enjoy exercising on wheels and in

difficult to handle. However, if simple precautions are
taken, hamsters can be routinely handled with minimal
stress to the animal and handler. Nonetheless, care

Common Diseases
Hamsters are prone to several diseases and condi-
tions. One common condition is called "wet tail." This
is caused by a bacterial disease that spreads rapidly
through direct contact or bacterial spores. Causes in-
clude overcrowded cages, poor nutrition, poor sanita-
tion methods, and stress. The hamsters can be treated
with antibiotics or medications and fluid therapy. They
 should be isolated from other hamsters and cages thor-
oughly sanitized. They are most susceptible to this con-
dition between the ages of 3 and 8 weeks old. Signs of
wet tail include the following:
· Watery diarrhea

Grooming
Grooming practices in rodents should include trimming
the teeth if they become overgrown, nail trims, and
bathing as necessary. Guinea pig's teeth, like other ro-
dents, grow continuously. Providing hard items for them
to chew on will keep their teeth healthy. Routine evalua-
tion of the teeth is important to make sure the teeth are
not becoming overgrown (see Figure 11-24]. Rodents
can be bathed using a safe waterless shampoo. Some
breeds will require regular brushing, especially if a long

are primarily nocturnal. They have an average lifespan
of 5-8 years. Ferrets combine the best features of dogs
and cats with some unique features of their own. Like
cats, ferrets are small and quiet. Like dogs, they are af-
fectionate, playful, and enjoy human interaction. They
are independent yet enjoy being with people. Their
mischievous and playful nature, retained well into old
age, makes them entertaining companions.

they will take anything that interests them and drag it
 off to their hiding place, usually under a couch or chair.
Basic Training
Ferrets can be litter trained in a similar manner as that
of cats and kittens. They can learn to perform tricks
with consistent training and rewards. Like dogs, fer-
rets can be trained to come when their name is called.
They can be trained to sit, beg for treats, and ride on
the owner's shoulder. They may also be walked on a

Basic Health Care and Maintenance
Ferrets should have an annual visit to a ferret-
knowledgeable veterinarian, which helps to identify po-
tential problems early. This yearly visit should include a
careful physical exam, inspection of the ears for mites,
and inspection of the teeth (see Figure 11-36]. Dental
cleanings should be performed as necessary. A test for
Aleutian Disease Virus should be done at least once a
year to ensure that the ferret is not carrying this highly
contagious and potentially fatal disease.

Common Diseases
Ferrets are relatively healthy animals, but ferrets are
susceptible to canine distemper and Aleutian disease.
In addition, they can come down with flulike symptoms
or respiratory illnesses, similar to the “common cold,"
which can be transmitted by human companions. It
is important to handle a ferret with extreme caution
should you become ill. Older ferrets can develop dis-
eases. Most commonly seen are diseases of the adrenal
glands and pancreas. Signs of an adrenal gland disorder
include hair loss, muscle atrophy, urinary blockage in
males, and enlarged vulva in females. Signs of pancre-
atic disease include lethargy, nausea, and seizures.
Any digestive problem (changes in bowel routine,
extreme weight gain or loss, vomiting] a ferret experi-
ences is potentially serious. The best way to prevent
these problems is to keep the ferret in an environment
that is clean and free of dangerous objects. Foam pack-
aging peanuts, rubber chew toys, erasers, rubber bands,
latex, or plastic items should be kept away from ferrets.

Nutrition
Hedgehogs are meat eaters and enjoy a diet of meal
worms and insects with a small amount of vegetables
and fruits in their diet. They will eat a commercial hedge-
hog diet that is high in protein. They will also eat high-
quality cat foods. They are prone to developing obesity
problems and care must be taken to not overfeed them.
Behavior
They are relatively solitary animals and do best housed
alone. Hedgehogs are nocturnal. They usually start their
nightly activities such as foraging as the sun goes down.
In the wild, hedgehogs may hibernate depending on the

are between 75 and 85 degrees. Lower temperatures may
make hedgehogs sluggish as they naturally are hibernat-
ing animals. Hedgehogs need places to hide, especially
during the day when they sleep. They can be provided a
plastic container with a hole in its side, a wide-diameter
section of PvC pipe, or a cardboard tube. They do like
exercise and will run in wheels similar to hamsters.
Restraint and Handling
The most important thing to remember when beginning
an examination on a hedgehog is that if the hedgehog
rolls up it will be nearly impossible to examine. The
more you fight with the pet, the fewer your chances of
getting it unrolled. However, most pets are fairly docile
and can be handled with latex exam gloves with relative
ease and a minimum of discomfort. An open hedgehog
should be scooped up from underneath and lifted off
the table. Supported on two hands off the table, they
will seldom attempt to roil up. Less cooperative hedge-
hogs may be scruffed by grasping the skin between the
ears and lifting the hedgehog off the table. A latex glove
will add a greater measure of control than a bare hand.

a few minutes for it to uncurl on the examination table
and then place the animal abdomen side down. Heavy
stroking of the spines toward the rump may help in this
method. Sometimes none of these methods will work
and as a last resort the best examination technique be-
comes the use of isoflurane. A large cone may be placed
over the entire animal until it starts to relax, then a
small cone may be placed over the face.
Grooming
Hedgehogs may become dirty and need an occasional
bath. This can be done using a toothbrush and warm
water. Some hedgehogs will allow light spraying of
water to remove dirt and debris. They should be towel
dried well in a warm location. They may need regular
nail trims, as well.

Equipment and Housing Needs
Chinchillas are acrobatic animals and therefore require
a lot of space to house. Since they like to climb and
jump in both horizontal and vertical directions, a large
multilevel cage is recommended. Ideally, the larger the
cage, the better for the chinchilla. The cage should be
constructed of a small weldled wire mesh to prevent leg
or foot injury. An area of solid flooring should also be
available. Drop pans below the cage are ideal for facili-
tating cleaning. Since chinchillas are shy animals, they
need a place to hide. Nondestructive boxes work well,
such as wooden or metal boxes.

Behavior
Rabbits make nice, quiet, and gentle pets and most
have docile attitudes. On occasion, a rabbit may pro-
duce a warning scream or growl to alert that it is un-
happy. They do have the instinct to protect themselves
by biting, kicking, and striking with the front limbs.

Rabbits may also be housed in commercial rabbit
pens made of metal, wire, plastic, or wood. These cages
should be made of solid materials and provide enough
space for the rabbit [see Figure 12-14]. Rabbits chew,
and this should be taken into consideration when select-

or are under increased amounts of stress. This condition
is treatable with antibiotics. Rabbits that survive this

Breeds
Reptile species come in a variety of appearances, sizes,
and colors. Reptiles can live 10-20 years depending on
the species and health care provided. Amphibian spe-
cies also have a variety of appearances, sizes, and colors
and have an average lifespan of 5-20 years or longer
depending on the species.
Snakes
Snakes come in a variety of breeds. The most common
breeds of snakes that are housed as pets include the boa
constrictor, python, and green snakes. These snakes grow
to a variety of sizes, some of which can be over 12 feet
in length. Many larger species of snakes eat live prey,
which they constrict to eat. They enjoy heat sources and
climbing. Cage temperatures should range from 85 to
90 degrees. Most of these breeds of snakes make good 
pets, but the larger species are not recommended for
children. A juvenile ball python is seen in Figure 13-14.
Lizards
Lizards come in a variety of sizes and appearances.
 Some commonly kept pet lizard breeds include iguanas,
 geckos, chameleons, and anoles. The green iguana is the
most commonly kept iguana breed (see Figure 13-15].

they will cannibalize and eat each other. They should stop

should gradually be introduced to their new diet needs.
Salamanders
Salamanders eat insects, worms, flies, shrimp, and in-
sect larvae. Many commercial diets have been formu-
lated into pellets for reptiles and amphibians.
Behavior
Most reptiles and amphibians are not relatively social
animals. They may become accustomed to humans, but
excessive handling may cause stress and result in their
refusing to eat.
Snakes
 Snakes are relatively docile when handled as young and
 accustomed to people. When upset or scared, many spe-
cies will bite. The constrictors will strike and apply pres-
sure by curling around parts of the body. Each species
should be researched for additional normal behaviors.
Snakes will go through a skin shed cycle known as ecdysis
[see Figure 13-20]. When a snake begins the shedding
cycle, the eyes will appear cloudy and the skin may de-
velop a milky coloration. At mid-cycle the eyes and skin
turn clear. The skin will shed about 1-4 days after this
occurs. Snakes should not be handled during the shed
cycle as their skin is very fragile and the new skin may
be damaged. Snakes and some lizards use their tongues
as sensory functions. They can smell and hear vibrations
through the air and ground using the tongue. The tongue
will flick as they sense their surroundings.
Lizards
Lizards are highly territorial or protective of their cages.
Males are more so than females. Males will be more
aggressive with other males than with females. Women
who are menstruating should use caution when handling
lizards. Male lizards are capable of detecting hormonal
changes and odors and their pheromones can lead to

Goldfish
Goldfish are one of the oldest breeds of ornamental
fish [see Figure 14-4]. They have been raised and bred
for over 2,000 years. Goldfish are small and commonly
a bright orange color, but many new and fancy colors
and interesting characteristics have been developed.
Fancy fins and large eyes, as well as a variety of colors,
have been bred. They are hardy and adapt well to a
wide range of environments. Their size depends on the
size of the tank they are housed in and their nutrition.
 Some are 1 to 2 inches in size and others can grow as
large as 2 feet in length. Goldfish require about two
gallons of fresh water to grow 2 inches in size. They

They have been known to live as long as 15 years.
They can lay up to 10,000 eggs that hatch in three to

are easy to raise and are very hardy. They are related
in sizes of 2 to 4 inches in length. They need plenty of
light. Caution should be used with breeding as some 
barbs eat their eggs after spawning.
Tetras
Tetras tend to require more care than some other species
of fish. The most common breed is the neon tetra, known
for its bright electric-blue stripe that runs the entire length
of the body (see Figure 14-8]. Many grow to lengths of
1 to 3 inches. They lay eggs that hatch within 30 hours.

Nutrition
Fish can easily be overfed. The amount a fish is to be
fed each day is called the ration. The ration should be
provided in the correct diet that meets the needs of the
fish species. The amount of food a fish eats in a day is
directly related to the water temperature as well as the
type of fish and the life stage. As water temperatures
rise, the need for food increases. The food should be
fed and eaten within a few minutes. Thus, careful obser-
vation will allow an owner to know how much to feed.
Overfeeding creates more waste products in the water.
FICURE 14-11 Angelfish.
Most people feed a commercial fish food made from
flakes or pellets. Most of these diets include protein and
grain sources. It is important to read all food labels for

are the wildlife species that are used for food and other
products produced by wild animals. These species may
be large or small. Many locations have designated
hunting seasons for a variety of animals. The State
Department and Game Commission are agencies that
and licenses for hunting. Every state within the United
States has its own Game Commission and State Depart-
ment. The State Departments govern the laws of each
state. The Game Commission agencies also serve educa-
tional and conservation purposes for wildlife and people.

wild species that are not hunted for food. They provide
beauty and entertainment only. Some of these animals
are food sources for predators or act as scavengers in
the environment. Many of these animal species are
found in urban and residential areas. Examples of non-
game animals include skunks, opossum, mice, raccoons,
and porcupine [see Figure 15-6].
Game fish are fish species that are in the wild and
are used for food and sport purposes. Game fish exist
in both fresh and salt waters. Many states have fish-
ing seasons also monitored and licensed by the Game
Commission. Examples of freshwater game fish include
bass, trout, and catfish (see Figure 15-7]. Saltwater
examples of game fish are tuna, flounder, and snap-
per (see Figure 15-8]. Non-game fish are species of
fish that are too small or too large to be caught on a
line. They may be found in any type of water, both fresh

bluegills, and sturgeon.
Game birds are wild bird species hunted for food
and sport. They are divided further into three catego-
ries. Migratory birds are birds that move from location
to location, sometimes out of the local area or state.
Examples of migratory game birds are the crow and
woodcock. waterfowl are birds that swim and spend a
large amount of time on the water. They include a va-
riety of species of ducks and geese [see Figure 15-9].
Upland game birds are wild species of birds that

out of the area. They include the pheasant, quail, and
turkey (see Figure 15-10). Game birds are regulated
by the state and federal government and by the Game
Commission.
Birds of prey or raptors are large species of birds
that are protected by law and are not legal to hunt
 or shoot. They are hunters that prey on other wildlife

Examples of birds of prey include eagles, owls, and
hawks (see Figure 15-11]. Non-game birds include all
other species of birds and songbirds. Many are found
in areas near homes and cities. They live in a variety of
environments from woodlands to waterways. Examples
of non-game birds include robins, pelicans, blue jays,
doves, cardinals, and wrens (see Figure 15-12].

The term sedate means to put to sleep with medicine
that allows an animal to be handled without it moving.
Sedated animals must be monitored for complications
and for the possibility of awaking before procedures
are complete. Proper sedatives, doses, and medica-
tions should be determined by a veterinarian. It is
these situations.
Wildlife Rehabilitation
Wildlife and people can live together in certain areas.
However, animals and people living in the same habi-
tats means more injuries, more disease, and more death
to the wildlife. Areas that have populations of wildlife
usually have wildlife rehabilitation centers or wildlife re-
habilitators. Wildlife rehabilitation centers are areas
that house and care for wildlife that are sick or injured
[see Figure 15-14]. These centers offer veterinary staff
who are knowledgeable and experienced in handling
and caring for wild animals. The staff usually consists
of veterinarians, veterinary technicians, and veterinary
assistants who have been trained to properly handle
wildlife. Most centers also rely on volunteers to help
with some basic duties and raise money for these pro-
grams, as finding profits to purchase supplies and pay
employees is difficult. These centers are not businesses

treatment, and monitor the range the animal travels

Capture and Restraint
of Wildlife
Capturing and handling wildlife can be a risk for both
the animal and the wildlife team working with the ani-
mal. Most wildlife is captured by trapping in humane
cages that contain the animal safely or by tranquilizers

Tranquilizers are administered with a dart gun so that
people do not have to get close to wildlife and become

The Exotic Animal
An exotic animal is an animal that is not native to the
area where it is raised and may be rarely found in its
natural habitat. Exotic animals are now being bred for
new characteristics, such as color or hair coats, and as
exotic pets. Many of these species require specialized
care and additional resources to survive and be healthy.
Most exotic animals are kept as companion animals or
breeding and production animals. Most are newly do-
mesticated animals that still have some wild instincts.
Some may be used as food sources or for products they

ment purposes, such as zoo and circus performances.
Others may be used for investment purposes, such as
sales or breeding.
Purposes and Uses of Exotics
A variety of exotic animals are raised as food sources
or other products used by people. These animals may
be considered agriculture in respect to food sources.
In the United States, llamas, alpacas, bison, deer,
elk, alligator, and ostrich are all raised for food and
other byproducts. These animals are raised, fed, and

due to the fact that bison meat is low in cholesterol
and lower in fat content than beef. Thus, the industry
has become an alternative profitable business method
to that of the beef industry. Several producers have
begun cross-breeding bison and domesticated beef
cattle breeds to produce beef animals with healthier
and tastier meat products. The cross of these two ani-
mals is called the beefalo. Cross-breeding is taking
two different breeds of related animals and producing
an animal with a combination of characteristics from
each animal.

Elk breeding and marketing has become a reward-

can range from $50,000-$60,000 depending on the
bloodlines and the quality of the animal.
Bison
Bison are mammals that are ruminants, related closely
to cattle. They are also known as the American Buffalo.
Bison are raised for meat and byproducts, such as their
skin pelts and horns [see Figure 16-3]. Bison are large
animals that may become aggressive and dangerous.
They require large amounts of land, secure types of
fencing, and specialized handling and restraint equip-

Alligators are dangerous wild animals and handling and

Rare Breeds
Other rare breeds of animals are bred and raised for
a variety of purposes. Some are considered alternative
livestock and others are exotic species. These include
mammals, reptiles, birds, and aquatics. Examples are
caiman, flamingos, zebu cattle, and zebra. Rare breeds
are animals that are newly developed and not common
or old breeds that were once popular and are now de-
creased in numbers. Producers and breeders take pride
in having a rare breed thrive and exist. Many of these
animals are domesticated and live well in the care of hu-
mans. Efforts are made to continue quality breeding and

health problems occur in animals that are not carefully

of research uses observation, measurements, and
experiments to determine data. An example of basic
research was the discovery of anthrax, which was dis-
covered to be bacteria while spores were isolated in
a research experiment. Applied research is done for
a specific purpose, such as developing a new vaccine
or medication. This type of research is completed by
using existing information. Finally, clinical research

SECTloN ll Veterinary Animal Production
regulate animal use in research on a federal level. This
legislation was brought about due to the debate on the
need for animal testing and the need for proper use of
animals in research. The AwA is enforced by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, which regulates and inspects
all facilities that conduct animal-related studies.
Lab Animal Management
and Health Practices
 Lab animals require controlled conditions in which they
are housed and cared for by proper hygiene and asepsis,
or a sterile environment. These facilities must use excel-
lent sanitation methods. This is due to the types of stud-
ies that may increase the chances for disease outbreaks
or the contamination of a study source. Cages and equip-
ment must be properly sterilized. Blood and tissue sam-
 ples must be handled with extreme care. All bedding,
food, and waste materials must be disposed of properly.
Lab animal nutrition should include high-quality, bal-
anced food. Each animal must be fed a strict diet that is

were one of the first domesticated livestock species.
Today there are over 1.5 billion cattle in the world. In
many parts of the world, cattle are considered sacred
animals and worshipped and valued greatly for their
milk and meat or as a living animal.
Breeds
Cattle breeds vary greatly in size, structure, and color.
 Some cattle are miniature in size, such as the zebu cattle,
and others are very large in size, such as the Limousine
and Brahman cattle. Beef breeds are bred to be heavier
in appearance and body weight (see Figure 18-4]. Beef
FIcurE 18-5 Dairy cattle are slender in body composition.
cattle should have large amounts of muscling over the
hindquarters, body, and pelvis. Dairy cattle are more
angular in shape and, due to smaller amounts of body
weight and muscle, have a bony appearance over the
pelvis and hind end [see Figure 18-5]. Some breeds of
cattle are dual purpose, meaning they serve more than
one purpose in their breed. For instance, some cattle
breeds are used for both meat and milk production,
 such as the South Devon and Salers.

then be traced to the sire (father] or the dam (mother].
Each cow has a permanent ID number, and when a calf
is entered into the system it records the progeny data
under this identification number. This can help provide
information to dairy breeders to research which bulls to
breed to their cows to increase milk production rates
in the dairy herd. This information can be used to de-
termine the estimates of traits a bull or cow will pass

four months of the gestation period are the most critical
for nutrition. Over this time frame, cows need increased
calcium and fat for energy to produce increased amounts
of milk. Lactation feeding can be the most challenging
nutritional stage, and several factors must be considered
when feeding the lactating cow. These factors include the
size of the cow, the stage of lactation, the quality of milk,
the labor capability, the food quality, the costs of food,
and the food palatability (how well the food tastes and is
eaten]. Cows are usually fed 1 pound of high-quality grain
for every 2.5-3 pounds of milk produced a day. High-
quality hay is fed at 1.5-2% of the cow's body weight.
High quality grain products include the following:

Behavior
Cows scare easily and become difficult to work with once
frightened. It may be difficult to settle down the cow
once spooked. Cattle are capable of kicking, stomping,
 and trampling people. When cattle are around people or
things that they are not used to they will become ner-
vous. This can lead to them running, jumping, or kick-
ing, and their size and actions can cause severe injury
to people. Cattle are very different from other types of

less than dairy cows. Dairy cattle grow accustomed to
humans during the milking process. Cattle are some-
times shown and must learn how to be handled with a

of the cow and the lead acts as a leash that is held to
walk the animal. Cattle should be taught to tie for both
showing and milking purposes [see Figure 18-17]. Tying
cattle is typically done using a square knot. The square

Basic Health Care
and Maintenance
Cattle production requires specific management and
health practices of the herds because both dairy and
beef cattle products are primarily used for human con-
sumption. Thus, strict guidelines must be followed when
caring for cattle. First, it is important that the produc-
ers and staff have knowledge and experience in cattle
production and availability of veterinary staff who have
a background in bovine medicine. Cattle require some
human interaction and should be used to people so that
health care and maintenance are relatively stress-free
for the herds. There should be a herd health manager
who records all health program and production informa-

background in bovine veterinary care and reproduction
and should be able to maintain herd health records, vac-
cine programs, deworming schedules, reproductive care
and records, and work closely with the veterinarian to
establish a high standard of care for the entire herd of
cattle. The goal of the herd health manager is to provide
a parasite- and disease-free herd. Cattle should be placed
on a regular daily schedule to provide a stress-free en-

whether housed indoors or outdoors. This includes ap-
propriate temperatures, proper shelter, appropriate hu-
midity, and ventilation. Cattle should be provided shelter
free from wind, rain, and cold weather. Water and feed
troughs should be kept clean. Fencing should be moni-
tored for the need of repair and maintenance. The herd
health manager will monitor the following:

CHAPTER 18 Beef and Dairy Cattle Breed Identification and Production Management
273
The Finishing System
The last type of beef cattle production is the finishing
system. The finishing system produces a calf that grows
through the entire adult stage. The adult cattle are sold for
profit as either a breeding animal or for the meat. Most
adult cattle weigh between 1,100 and 1,300 pounds as
adults at market weight. These cattle are fed concen-
trates, or a mixture of foods high in energy and fat, as
well as minerals that help promote growth. This system is
more costly and takes a longer time for a profit, but the
profit is much larger due to the size of the animal.

Veterinary Terminology
Horses are classified in terms based on their age,
gender, size, and type of use. Several different terms
are used to describe horses. An adult female horse
is called a mare and an adult male horse that is ca-
pable of reproduction is called a stallion. A female
horse that has not been bred is called a maiden
horse. The male parent is known as a sire and the
female parent is called a dam. The male horse used
in a breeding program is called a stud horse. when
a male horse is castrated it is called a gelding. A
young newborn horse is called a foal; the female is
specifically called a filly and the male is known as a
colt [see Figure 19-2]. The labor or birth process of
horses is known as foaling. In veterinary medicine,
FlGUrE 19-3 Example of a light horse.
horses are called equines. They are also classified
by their sizes and purposes or uses. There are light
horses, draft horses, and ponies. Equine species are
measured in hands. A hand is equal to 4 inches and
is used to measure the height of a horse at the high-
est point of the shoulder. Light horses are typically
riding horses that stand between 14.3 and 17 hands
in height and weigh between 900 and 1,400 pounds
[see Figure 19-3]. Draft horses are known as large
and muscular animals that weigh over 1,400 pounds
and stand over 15 hands in height (see Figure 19-4].
Ponies are small in size, standing under 14.2 hands
in height and weighing less than 900 pounds. They
are usually favored by small children. Other types
of equines are donkeys and mules. A donkey is a
member of the equine family and sometimes called
a burro. The female donkey is called a jenny and the
male is called a jack. A mule is the cross of a female
a female donkey will produce a hinny.

Biology
Horses are large animals that are classified as livestock,
similar to cattle. Horses are from the genus and species
Equus caballus and developed from prehistoric types of
horses. The purposes and use of horses have changed
over the last several hundred years. Many breeds and
varieties of horses have been developed.
Horses are herbivores and feed on a plant-based
a specialized digestive system called nonruminant.
A nonruminant digestive system is similar in appear-
ance to humans but requires small amounts of food
to be eaten and digested throughout the day, similar
to cattle and other grazing animals. They have a rela-
tively small stomach with a long intestinal tract that al-

Grains can be ground down, cracked, or shelled for better
digestion. All foods should be free of dust and mold. The
usual maintenance diet for a horse requires one pound of
protein per 1,0o0 pounds body weight. Horses are typi-
cally fed twice daily with adequate amounts of pasture
 or hay (see Figure 19-18). Forages, or hay and pasture,
may include timothy, orchard grass, or alfalfa sources.
Hay should be kept dry and monitored for signs of mold.
Hay should be fed at one to two pounds per 100 pounds
of body weight and may be provided several times daily.

the horse. Due to being domesticated thousands of years
ago, horses have learned to become trusting of people.
The horse is an animal that is not always accustomed to
loud noises and will react in various ways, such as spook-
ing or startling. Horses are known to display many types
of behaviors that are normal for the horse but can be
dangerous for humans handling or working near them.
Such normal behaviors for a startled horse may include
kicking, bucking [lifting and kicking with the rear limbs],
rearing (lifting the front limbs off the ground and rais-
ing the body into the air], striking with the front legs,
or biting. A horse's body language will show if a horse
is happy, angry, or scared. The happy horse will appear
relaxed, ears forward and alert, with a relaxed tail and a
relaxed eye expression. The angry horse will appear with
its ears pinned back on its head, bared teeth, flicking tail,

prevent dehydration. Horses should not be allowed to

can lead to severe stomach pain. Any changes in diet
should be done gradually over a 7-10 day time frame
to avoid digestive problems. Table 19-1 outlines the rec-
ommended rations for horses.
Behavior
Horses are herd animals and prefer to live in groups.
Within a group or herd, each horse has its place, known
as a hierarchy. This is also called the “pecking order"
in which animals have behaviors that direct others and
allow for more control over the group. Horses are also
comforted by being near or with other horses. This can de-
termine their type of behavior depending on the situation.
Horses are suspicious by nature and can quickly learn to
detect a nervous person working or handling them. This
can decrease the amount of control a person has over

Basic Training
Horses are trainable in many disciplines. Horses may be
ridden, driven, used as pack animals, and kept as com-
panions. There are many areas of training involved with
horses depending on their purpose and use. Professional
trainers should work in training young or inexperienced
horses as many problems, such as kicking, rearing, or
 bucking, may occur with someone who is not used to 
training a horse. All horses should be taught to lead on
a rope, walking calmly and quietly with a person (see
FIcurE 19-21 Horse can be trained to walk on a lead with

post or chain and also on cross ties, which are two ropes
placed on either side of the halter and then secured to
a wall or post (see Figure 19-22]. Horses should als0
be trained to work on a longe line, which is a long rope
that allows a horse to work at various gaits while cir-
cling the handler. Riding and driving horses should be
taught basic commands such as the walk, jog or trot,
and lope. They should also be trained to stop and back
up. A large amount of basic training in the horse is gain-
ing the horse's respect and trust.
Equipment and Housing Needs
Horse facilities should consist of a barn or shelter area.
Shelter may be a run-in shed with at least three sides
that will protect the horse from the weather. Barns may

tom of the halter. When handling and restraining a horse,
one should never wrap the lead rope around the hand
or wrist. Hold the lead in neat loops with the left hand
and hold the lead rope close to the halter with the right.
This allows the restrainer or handler to move freely from
one side to another to control the horse. Leading a horse
is done by walking with the horse near its left shoulder
about one foot from the horse. Caution must be taken
to avoid being stepped on by the horse. Tying a horse
should be done with a slip knot that is used in case of a
quick release. Tie the horse to allow 2-3 feet of lead rope
to allow some movement and allow it to hold its head
even with its withers. Horses can also be placed on cross

This is used as a control method as well as an additional
distraction when working with a horse. Lifting a horse's
feet should be done with the restrainer standing with the
body facing the rear of the horse. When working with the
front feet and legs, one should stand at the shoulder of
the horse and run a hand down the rear aspect of the
limb and gently squeeze the fetlock joint, just above the
hoof. When the horse lifts its foot, hold it by the hoof and
balance it on the knee or firmly in the hand. When lifting
the rear feet, stand facing the rear of the horse and fairly
close to the side of the hindquarters. Run the hand down
the leg in the same manner as the front limb. When the
horse lifts the foot, grasp it at the hoof and move slightly
forward to stretch the leg out and allow the hoof to rest

average 340 days or 11 months. The process of parturi-

frame. Broodmares may be kept in a large stall or in a
large pasture to foal. Signs of a mare going into labor
will begin 12-24 hours prior to the parturition process.
It is important that mares be kept in a dry and clean
area during labor. Some signs will be noted 7-10 days
prior to the labor process, especially in experienced
broodmares. Signs of labor includle the following:
■  Large distended mammary glands

 Draft animals include several species of large animals
that were developed to work and pull heavy loads.
Many of these animals were developed for specific pur-
poses and were domesticated to help serve humans in
today's society. Draft animals include mules, oxen, and
draft horses.
Breeds
Several species of animals are used for draft purposes.
Horses, oxen, mules, donkeys, camels, elephants, and
bison are the most common draft animals in use today.
Draft animals have been bred and trained for pulling
heavy loads and providing strong power for farming
purposes. People in the United States still use horses,
mules, donkeys, and oxen as draft animals. Camels, buf-
falo, and elephants are used in some countries in simi-
lar ways.

Breed Selection
Draft animals are mostly used for work purposes but
also are bred as show animals. Horses, donkeys, mules,
and oxen can all be shown as their respectable breeds or
species. They may be judged based on their conforma-
tion or body structure, power, or athletic ability. Some
events they may compete in are horse pulls, draft hitch
classes, farming demonstrations, or log pulling. Horse
pulls are contests of power to see which animal can pull
the heaviest load with the least damage to the land.
Draft hitch classes are based on the number of animals
used to pull a wagon and how the team works together

Draft animal reproduction is similar to other livestock
species. Draft horses have the same estrus cycle and
breeding methods as all other horse breeds as dis
cussed in Chapter 19. The only difference is that draft
horses tend to reach puberty around 12-15 months of
age. Oxen have similar estrus cycles and breeding meth-

Sows should be reevaluated between 150 and 200
pounds of growth. This is to ensure that sows are growing
adequately and will be excellent producers for breeding
or meat production programs. How well the sow gains
weight will determine if the sow may be replaced or put
into a reproduction program based on the data.
Boar selection is based on the temperament and
body structure. Boars should be selected from large
litters, have a medium to large body structure, should
reach the adult size by 155 days of age or less, and
have less than one inch of backfat. ldeal weight gain for
breeding boars is 2 pounds of body weight gain per day.
It is necessary for reproduction programs to have one
boar for every 15-20 sows. The boar should enter the
breeding program between 6 and 7 months of age and
begin breeding sows around 8 months of age.

4-5 pounds of feed per day. Young boars under a year

hurdle, or a panel board that is flat and kept between
the handler and the pig to act as a wall (see Figure 21-8].
Hurdles are commonly solid pieces of wood, plastic, or
metal. They are large enough to cover the legs of the han-
dler and used to isolate a pig against a wall or to move
it from one area to another. Paddles can also be used in
a similar manner. Paddles are similar to hurdles with a
long handle that acts as an extension of the arm.
Pigs less than 50 pounds of weight can be restrained
for exams, vaccines, or medication administration by
lifting them by the rear feet and placing the head be-
tween the legs for control. The front legs can touch the
ground for support of the body weight (see Figure 21-9].
To catch a pig, it is best to grasp one rear leg. Piglets
less than 5 pounds can be handled similar to carrying a
dog. Quickly place one hand and arm under the piglet's
chest and the other over its shoulders. Lifting may be
done by supporting and controlling the head and back
end. Holding pigs firmly but gently is necessary. Pigs will
likely squeal and become vocal. This can be dangerous
aggressive. In these cases, piglets and sows should be
separated when handling. Restraint equipment includes
a hog snare, snubbing rope, or trough. The hog snare
is the restraint tool of choice and is a long pipe with a ca-
 ble loop attached to the end. The loop is used to rope the
upper jaw of the pig and then tightened around the snout
(see Figure 21-10]. The snare is kept elevated above the
 pig to control the animal for 20-30 minute periods. This

can be used to restrain a pig for blood collection, exams,
and injections. A snubbing rope can be used to tie a pig
for restraint. The rope is used in the same manner as the
hog snare over the snout. The rope can be tied to a post
for similar restraint. Smaller pigs can be restrained using
a trough. This is a V-shaped table that is used to hold a
pig on its back for surgery and other procedures. A rope
may be used to keep the pig still.

Nutrition
 Sheep are ruminants that have a roughage-based diet and
require quality hay and pasture sources (see Figure 22-4].
Typically, most sheep will not need a grain source unless
during gestation or other health issues require addi-
tional supplements. Sheep use carbohydrates and fats for
energy, usually provided through pasture, hay, silage, or
grains. Protein is acquired through alfalfa hay, linseed oil,
 or peanut oil supplements. Vitamins A, D, E, and K are
needed and providled in quality hay and pasture sources.
Vitamin B is naturally produced in the rumen of the
digestive system. The rumen is the filter system of the ru-
minant animal digestive system. This helps break down
fiber sources, such as hay and grass. Minerals that are
necessary in small amounts are salt, phosphorus, calcium,

Grooming
Many breeds are raised for wool. Few breeds shed their
own wool and require regular shearing, or shaving of
the wool. Shearing is done carefully with clippers or
shears that easily remove and prevent damage to the
wool quality (see Figure 22-6]. Most producers will
shear several times a year, but care must be taken to
not allow sheep to overheat in the summer or become
sick in the winter due to the length of the wool coat.

called mohair. Angora goats are also used for meat.
Goats, like sheep, are ruminants. Goats range in sizes 
from 20 pounds to well over 150 pounds and range in
height between 1.5 and 4 feet. The life span of goats
averages from 8-10 years. Male goats are known for
 having a strong odor that is due to hormones that are
present on the top of the head, usually behind the
horns. The scent glands create an unpleasant odor
that is typically used to rub objects or areas to mark
their territory. Young male goats' scent glands are usu-
ally removed during dehorning. Figure 23-1 illustrates
the anatomical features of the goat.
Breeds
There are over 300 breeds of domesticated goats. Wild
goats are still found in the United States and various
other countries. There are five groups of goat breeds:

Dairy
Milk from dairy goats is a desirable product to people who
have digestion problems and sensitivities to dairy prod-
ucts. Goat milk is easy to digest, has more vitamin A than
other animals, and has less fat due to the particles known
as globules. There are six common breeds of dairy goat
in the United States: French alpine, Oberhasli, LaMancha,
Nubian (see Figure 23-3], Saanen, and Toggenburg.
Meat
The meat goats are raised for meat sources and are
bred for quality muscles. Most meat goats are from
 Spanish breeds. A popular meat breed goat is the Boer
goat [see Figure 23-4].
Cashmere
FICURE 23-4 Boer g0at.
Cashmere refers to the soft down or undercoat produced
cashmere. There is no registered breed for cashmere
goats, although goats have been bred to improve on
this characteristic.
Pygmy
The Pygmy goats are miniature-sized goats commonly
used as pets and in research [see Figure 23-5]. They are
great entertainers and very playful. Pygmy goats can
be produced for milk and meat. Due to their small size,
these goats are relatively easy to handle.
FIcURE 23-5 Pygmy goat.
Breed Selection
Goat selection should be based on the type of production
or purpose, such as raising dairy or meat goats. Hair
and coat characteristics are important considerations
for fiber goat production. The primary concern in dairy
 goats is milk production.

Goats will eat anything, especially weeds and browse,

over the back similar to hackles on a dog, holding the
tail close to the back, sneezing, stomping, and snort-

monly kept as pets. They become less playful with age.
Nanny goats remain calmer as adults than billy goats.

the food efficiently, a fast return on the investment, a
high profit compared to the cost of feed, the amount of

Nutrition
Adult poultry should receive a commercial feed that is
formulated for the species of fowl. The maintenance diet
of adult poultry should be a 12-15% protein-based
grain diet. Young chicks begin eating starter food that is
between 18 and 20% protein and should be placed on
a commercial diet as quickly as possible. Poultry will eat
off of the ground or in pans and dishes. Most produc-
ers use an automated system to prevent contamination
or disease in aseptic environments. Automated feeder
 systems consist of a trough or tray that releases specific

amounts of food at certain times [see Figure 24-14].
This is done through a conveyer belt system that weighs
the feed and distributes a set amount. Water may be
provided in a similar manner but must be monitored for
appropriate daily consumption. Water troughs should
be cleaned on a daily basis to prevent contamination.
Behavior
Poultry are known for their adaptable behavior to any
type of environment and changing conditions. The
domestic fowl by nature is a wary, shy animal. Poultry
have excellent vision and hearing, but other senses
tend to be poorly developed. Many poultry species are
gregarious in nature and have a social status within
with the head position that allow communication with
other birds. They maintain contact with flock mates

by sight and vocal communication. They often become

nervous and more vocal when flock mates get out of
sight. A male rooster will establish hens as his territory
and will become aggressive and fight with other roost-
ers that may attempt to enter the flock. Poultry will
become aggressive with humans and may become ter-
ritorial and attempt to chase and flop using the wings
as weapons.
Basic Training
FlcurE 24-15 Poultry can become accustomed to being
handled with care.
Poultry species that may be shown can be trained to
be handled and restrained rather easily. This should be-
gin when the fowl are young and continue with routine
handling. The wings should be extended for observa-
tion and examination (see Figure 24-15]. The feet and
legs should be handled, as well as feathers checked for
proper appearance. Poultry will easily adjust to humans
with regular handling.
Equipment and Housing Needs
Housing poultry will depend on the type of production
and the number of birds within the flock. Housing may
be as basic as a cage or shed or an elaborate building
that houses 40,000 birds [see Figure 24-16]. Housing
must meet the needs of the birds as far as temperature
FIcurE 24-16 Enclosure for a small flock of chickens.
CHAPTER 24 Poultry Breed Identification and Production Management
351
and humidity. Day-old chicks require 1/4 to 1/3 of a square
foot of space per bird. Space requirements increase with
the growth of the chick. Growers will commonly use wire
portable fencing to contain chicks and remove the fence
as the birds grow. Floor and cage coverings must be
gentle and dust-free. Litter is commonly used as bed-
ding and is made of fine wood shavings that absorb
the droppings. Proper lighting is necessary for growth
and ideal health. Artificial lights are commonly placed
on timers to increase growth and egg production. Tem-
peratures should be controlled at 85-95 degrees for
young growers and after 6 weeks of age can be reduced
to 70-75 degrees. Proper ventilation is required and a
relative humidlity of 50-75% is ideal. Emergency gener-
ators should be available in large commercial programs
in case of power failures.
Restraint and Handling
Poultry should be restrained and handled by holding
the wings against the bird's body to keep them from
flapping, which could injure the handler or the animal.
The body should be restrained securely with one arm
and the head held around the neck with the other hand
[see Figure 24-17]. Poultry are like caged birds in that
they must breathe using their diaphragm and chest and
should never be held tightly around this area. Young
chicks often lie quietly in the hand and can be easily
examined [see Figure 24-18].
Grooming
Poultry do not typically require grooming but species
that are shown should be clean and free of external par-
FIGUrE 24-17 Proper methods to restrain poultry.
asites, dirt, and debris. Feathers can be gently sprayed
with water to remove dust and debris. Fowl will preen
and clean their wings and feathers many times through-
out the day. Some owners may want the nails trimmed,
wings clipped to prevent flying, and beaks dremeled due
to overgrowth [see Figure 24-19].
Basic Health Care and
Maintenance
All birds go through a process of shedding their feath-
ers, known as molting. This process allows for new
feather growth. During this time, hens will decrease pro-
duction of eggs or may stop lying all together. The body
is depleted of calcium as new feather development and
FIGurE 24-18 A young bird will sit quietly in the hand.
352
SECTloN ll Veterinary Animal Production
to winter. Molting occurs over a four-month period until
the new feathers develop. Producers may do a forced
molting of some hens so that egg production profits do
not stop for all layers. The forced molting is the process
of using lights to trigger the molting phase to begin at
a time of the year when it doesn't normally occur. This
is done by decreasing the light during the day through
the use of artificial lights. Allowing eight hours of light
and a longer dark period will trigger the molting phase
to begin. After the molting occurs, the light should be
returned to 14-16 hours of light.
Sanitation is essential for all poultry systems as one
sick bird can kill an entire flock quickly. Good sanitation
control methods are required to ensure disease-free
[A]
flocks. Insect control and removal of waste materials
is important. Sanitation control methods include the
following:
■Disinfection of cages, equipment, and clothing
■ Use of insecticides
■ Waste control
■ Disposal of dead birds
 Removal of litter
■ Limitations on access of people and vehicles
Dead bird disposal follows guidelines and regula-
tions due to the potential for human contact and the
spread of disease in wild bird species. Any dead birds

method of disease is through incineration. This is the
process of burning the carcass (dead animal's body]
to ashes. Other methods of disposing of a dead bird
include composting, which is the process of layering
the carcass with waste materials and bedding to allow
decomposition or wearing away. Burial is a method of
 placing the carcass in the ground and covering.
Vaccinations
Poultry should be on a regular vaccination program
that helps to develop immunity to specific diseases [see
Figure 24-20). Fertile eggs can be vaccinated using
a vaccine during the incubation phase. This is usually

injecting 20,000-30,000 eggs per hour. If the in vivo
method is not used, vaccines should be administered
on day one of the hatch at the time of the de-beak pro-
cedure. The vaccine can be administered into a wing,
within the eye membrane, or via a nostril. The program
should vaccinate for common diseases and should have
all vaccines and boosters completed by 12 weeks of
age. Breeders typically vaccinate every three months or
as necessary.
Reproduction and Breeding
Female hens lay eggs that are sterile if no male is present
and fertile eggs if a male rooster is available within the
flock. The roosters and hens must mate for fertilization
of eggs to occur. The eggs may be incubated or left on the

Tapeworms are more common in poultry with access to

hosts including snails, earthworms, beetles, and flies. Pre-
vention is through diet control, dewormers, and proper
sanitation. Signs of tapeworms include pale skin over the

Broiler Production
The first system type is called broiler production. The
goal of this system is to produce the largest amount of
meat as quickly as possible. Chicks are raised to 6 weeks
of age and should weigh around 4 to 4.5 pounds in size.
They are raised in large poultry houses in confinement to
prevent disease and contamination (see Figure 24-24].
They must stay healthy to continue adequate growth.
The chicks should grow fast in an eficient amount of
time to reduce costs. The mortality [death rate] should
be kept at less than 5%. The larger the number of live-
stock and production animals that are produced, the
larger the death rate.
Broilers should grow at a rate of 1 pound weight
gain for every 2 pounds of food. Young newborn chicks
are fed starter food, which is finely ground grain meal.
Starter food should be between 18 and 20% protein
for ideal growth. As the chicks age, the protein amount

The egg quality is determined both by the internal and
external appearance of the egg [see Figure 24-27]. The

egg production. Cracks, blemishes, and dirt are signs of

Aquaculture Production
Systems
Aquaculture is based on the need for a water facility.
Examples of water facilities include ponds, rivers, lakes,
streams, tanks, vats, and aquariums. These facilities are
developed to resemble the natural environment and ac-
commodate each specific type of organism.
Ponds
Ponds are a contained water area surrounded by human-
built dams or levees; they are not naturally occurring
bodies of water. They range in size of less than an acre
FlcuRE 25-8 Earthen raceway for trout.
up to 50 acres. Ponds do not drain or have an active
moving water source, so management of water is impor-
tant. Ponds are typically rectangular in shape and range
from 3-5 feet in depth (see Figure 25-7].
Raceways
Raceways are long and narrow water structures with
flowing water. Raceways are common in fish hatcher-
ies for breeding purposes and are used to increase the
water during fishing seasons. They may be built of differ-

that may be used to house aquatic species. Tanks are

shape but smaller in size. Aquariums are much smaller
Pens and cages are small structures placed in bodies of
water to confine aquacrops. A pen is a structure used to
connect land with water (see Figure 25-10]. They may
have posts in the ground for support and are usually kept
in shallow water less than 3 feet deep. They rest in the
muddy bottom of the water source to provide nesting
and breeding areas. A cage is a structure that floats on the
surface of the water. It is usually made of net material and
doesn't touch the bottom of the water bed. It is commonly
used in large bodies of water to confine aquatic species.
Water Sources
There are three types of water sources used in aqua-
culture production. The first is freshwater. Fresh-

While animal species vary in appearance, there are
 similarities in external body structures and the functions
of those structures. Sometimes the structures share a
common name and other times the name for the struc-
ture may be specific to a particular species of animal.
Each species of animal was discussed in the production
chapters of this text. It is recommended that you refer
to each chapter for an external anatomy diagram and
 proper terminology of the external body parts related
to a specific species. All animals have a head, body, and
tail area. Some animals have feet, paws, or hooves. It
is important that veterinary assistants become familiar
 with the terminology of external anatomical structures
of the species they commonly work with.

Joints

Midline
The area where two bones meet forms a joint. Joints
allow the animal to bend in areas with a level-like move-
ment. There are three main types of joints located in
the body. A fibrous joint is a fixed joint with little to
no movement. The area where two bones of a fibrous
joint meet is called a suture. This is a fine line that con-
nects the bones, but little to no movement occurs. An
example of this type of joint occurs throughout the skull.
A cartilage joint connects at the end of a joint where
cartilage forms to protect and cushion the area where

as the animal ages, the cartilage joint becomes bone.
The third type of joint is a synovial joint. This type of
joint is movable and may be a hinge joint that opens
and closes in a one-way movement, a pivot joint that

puppies that grow too quickly are more prone to this
condition. Anti-inflammatory medications may be given
to relieve pain and inflammation of the condition. Se-
vere stages of hip dysplasia may require surgical hip
replacement. Careful breeding of selective dogs will de-
crease the occurrence of hip dysplasia. Breeders should
be evaluating their breeding dogs for hip dysplasia by
having a hip X-ray certification through the Orthopedic
Foundation of Animals [OFA] or through the University
of Pennsylvania's PennHIP program.

Arthritis is a common condition of older animals
in which the joints become inflamed and other changes
in the joints may be noted. This condition causes lame-
ness and pain and worsens over time. Signs of arthritis
in animals include the following:
■  Favoring a limb or limping
■ Difficulty sitting or standing 
■ Sleeping more
■ Seeming to have stiff or sore joints
 Hesitancy to jump, run, climb stairs
■  Weight gain
Decreased activity or less interest in play/activity

well as dietary supplements may be helpful in reducing
pain. Many arthritis medications are now available to
aid the joints of affected animals.
Intervertebral disc disease or IVD is another com-
mon occurrence in dogs, but there are more injuries in
certain breeds of long-backed dogs, such as the Basset
Hound, Dachshund, and Corgi. IVD is caused when pres-
sure occurs between the discs due to inflammation from
an injury. The inflammation and swelling place pressure
between the affected vertebrae, causing pain on the spi-
nal nerves and possible trauma to the spinal cord. Most
common signs of the condition include severe pain and
possible paralysis. The paralysis can affect the back,
head, neck, and limbs. The paralysis may affect the abil-
ity of the animal to control urination and defecation. Ste-
roids may be used to help decrease inflammation and
muscle relaxers may be necessary to reduce pain.
Cruciate ligament tears are a common injury
to any active dog but tend to be more complicated in
large-breed dogs. It is possible for any type of animal to

to bone development. Cartilage rebuilds and forms a

Dehydration
 Both vomiting and diarrhea can lead to dehydration,
the loss of fluids in the body. Dehydration can be estab-
lished by the evaluation of skin turgor. This is the area
of skin at the base of the neck and over the shoulders
 and back that is elastic-like. The hydration status can be
determined by lifting the skin up and monitoring how
quickly it "snaps" back in place. The normal skin turgor
should snap back in place immediately like elastic. When
dehydration occurs the skin turgor will stay "tented" or
appear not to go back in its normal position over the
neck and shoulders. The hydration status can also be

Constipation
Constipation is another occurrence in the digestive sys-
tem that can cause little to no bowel movement produc-
tion. A constipated animal may show signs of stomach
pain, straining to produce a bowel movement, and de-
creased appetite. Many factors can cause constipation,
such as poor diet, eating items that are not digestible,
not drinking enough, or a low-fiber diet. Constipated
mine the cause. Patients should be treated by the vet-
erinarian according to how constipated they are. Some
animals may require an enema, or a procedure that
passes fluids into the rectum and colon to soften feces
to allow the animal to have a bowel movement. Many
times this is done using warm, soapy water. Animals
 may need stool softeners or laxatives given by mouth
ing. A high-fiber diet may also be recommended to
produce normal bowel movements.
Colic
Colic is a common condition in horses. Colic is a severe
stomach pain that may be caused by many factors; some-
times the factor remains unknown (see Table 28-3].

due to air and gas within the stomach and intestinal
tract. Bloat in dogs is more common in large and gi-
ant breeds, but it can occur in any type of dog. Dogs
that become bloated should be handled as an emer-
gency and seen immediately by a veterinarian. Dogs
may become bloated for several reasons, usually by
ingesting food very quickly, exercising shortly after
eating, getting into garbage or food they are not ac-
customed to eating, or drinking excessive amounts of
fluids. This condition is called gastric dilation. Dogs
that become bloated could progress to a condition
known as gastric dilation volvulus or GDV, in which
the stomach or intestinal tract rotates and causes a
similar condition to that of horses that colic. Bloat or
gastric dilation may be treated by placing a stomach
tube into the Gl system to remove excessive air or
gas. Dogs that have GDV require immediate surgery

Foreign Body Obstructions
Foreign body obstructions may occur in any type of
animal that ingests an item that is not digestible or
(a)
may become impacted within the digestive system.
Items that are ingested may be toys, household items,
or items found outside [see Figure 28-15]. Diagn0-
sis of a foreign body within the digestive tract may
be done through radiographs or through the use of
oral barium study. Oral barium is given by mouth
and radiographs are taken over time as the barium
passes through the digestive system. The barium is
radiopaque and fluoresces as it passes through the Gl
system (see Figure 28-16]. The radiographs will help
determine if an object is moving through the system
or if it has become obstructed and requires surgical
removal. A foreign body obstruction may cause the in-
testinal tract to telescope upon itself causing an intus-
susception. This causes the blood supply to be cut off.
When a foreign body is surgically removed from the
stomach or intestinal tract and the blood supply has
been cut off causing an area of dead or necrotic tissue
to occur, there may be a need for an anastomosis sur-
gery. This is the surgical removal of an area of dead
tissue along the intestinal tract, which requires a re-
section of the intestines.
Signs of an animal with a foreign body obstruction
include the following:

Structures of the Respiratory
System
The respiratory system begins at the nostrils or nares.
Each nostril is covered by a lining of mucous membranes
and has numerous blood vessels. They also contain thin
bonelike scrolls or plates of cartilage. The nostrils create
an airway and help trap dust and foreign particles within
the upper airway to prevent entry into the lungs. The nos-
trils have the ability of raising the temperature of cold air
before entering the lungs. The mouth also serves as an
food. The larynx lies within the throat and is cartilage

which sound like cellophane paper being folded.
Asthma
Asthma is a condition in which the lungs have difficulty
taking in enough oxygen. Asthma can lead to a condi-
tion where a lack of oxygen causes the animal's mu-
cous membranes to turn blue called cyanosis. During
an asthma attack the sound of wheezing can be heard.
Medications may be used to open up the bronchioles
 and lungs during these situations. These medications
are known as bronchodilators.

Pancreas
The pancreas is another organ within the endocrine
system. It serves a dual role in endocrine and exocrine
production and functions. The pancreas produces and
regulates insulin production. Insulin is regulated by the
blood glucose level, also known as blood sugar. The re-
lease of insulin following a meal is created by a response
from the pancreas. This response causes sugar metabo-
lism, which is a conversion of insulin to glucose to glyco-
gen to fat. Sugar metabolizes as the blood level decreases
as food digests, and this is repeated after each meal.
Thymus
The thymus is a gland in young animals. It has immuno-
logic functions through maturation of t-lymphocytes.

within the bloodstream [see Figure 32-1]. Urine is formed
in the kidneys, flows through the ureters to the bladder,

Kidneys
The kidneys are two organs located in the dorsal abdo-

They are reddish brown in color and are bean shaped and
smooth (see Figure 32-2]. Cows are the only animal spe-
cies that have lobed kidneys, rather than a smooth sur-
face (see Figure 32-3]. Each kidney has a renal artery

when using Al methods. The female must be in heat and
near ovulation, and determining this requires proper es-

mon failure of the Al procedure is failure to properly
detect and determine the ovulation of the animal. There
are many reasons to use Al, such as the male animal

female are not compatible, the animal is too aggressive
to safely breed, or the female's estrus cycles are difficult
to regulate. The first step in the artificial insemination

frozen semen must be warmed to 95-98 degrees. Fresh
semen should be used within 24 hours. The insemina-
tion process should be done at intervals during at least
two times prior to ovulation. This requires knowledge of
the species and proper timing of the cycle.
Some Al procedures place the semen in the uterus
while others place the semen within the cervix. This de-
pends on the animal species and where the embryo grows
within the reproductive process. Many female animals will
stand for the Al procedure while other species may need
to be sedated for surgical Al placement. It is important to

Vaccines
Vaccinations are placed within the body as antigens,
which are foreign materials used to create an immune
response. Vaccinations are started in young animals as
a series of booster shots that slowly build up the im-
mune system and help prevent infection of the body by
becoming resistant to diseases. Vaccine booster shots
provide a primary response and a secondary response.
The primary response of a vaccine provides antigens
that need 3 to 14 days to build an immune response
that begins producing antibodies. The secondary
response of a vaccine provides a quick, repeated ex-
posure to an antigen that creates immunity to prevent

amounts, it can lead to obesity and other health prob-
lems. Many diets contain fatty acids, which are oils that
are products of fat sources that may be used as nutri-
ents or supplements within a diet. Fatty acids are help
ful in skin and hair coat hydration. Fats are measured
by calories or the unit of measurement that defines the
which are the amount of energy to raise 1 gram of water
by 1 degree, and is written as a kcal. Calories and kilo-
calories are measured with a calorimeter, which is an
instrument that measures the amount of heat released
by a food product. This measurement determines the
length of metabolism, which in turn predicts the amount
of energy in the food particle. This is the information
that is placed on food labels for nutrition information.
Examples of fatty acids include fish oil, linseed oil, fish
meal, and vegetable oil. Fats form solid particles and
oils or acids form liquid particles. One benefit for ani-
mal feeds is that fat increases the palatability of food,
or how good it tastes and if it is eaten by any animal.
Fatty acid sources may be essential or nonessential.

are found mostly in the bones and teeth. Minerals are
used by the body based on the animal's needs and
mineral availability. Calcium is a mineral that makes up
about 5o% of the body's mineral source and is found
in many organic body fluids, such as blood and tissues.
The body's functions rely on mineral balances to main-
tain regular rates and duties, such as the heart rate
and respiratory rate. There are two types of minerals:
 macrominerals and microminerals. Macrominerals are
minerals needed in large amounts, such as calcium,
phosphorus, and iron. Microminerals are minerals
needed in small amounts, such as sodium, potas-
sium, and magnesium. These minerals are often called
trace minerals.
Vitamins
Vitamins are nutrients needed in small amounts for
life and health maintenance. Vitamins help provide a
defense against disease [vitamin E], promote growth
[vitamin D] and reproduction [vitamin B12], and con-
tribute to the general health of the animal by regula-
tion of body functions. Vitamins react with enzymes to
allow body functions to occur. Some vitamins act as
antioxidants within the body's system to boost the
immune system. There are two types of vitamins: fat
soluble and water soluble. Fat soluble vitamins are
stored in fat and released when needed within the
body. Vitamins A, D, E, and K are fat soluble. Vitamin A
is the most common vitamin not available in commer-
cial animal foods. Fat soluble vitamins can be given in
excessive amounts, resulting in a toxic reaction that
poisons the system and that can cause damage to
the kidneys and heart. Water soluble vitamins are not
stored within the body, are dissolved by water, and are

therefore needed in daily doses by the body. Vitamins C
484
SECTloN Ill General Anatomy and Disease Processes
and D are water soluble. Vitamin D is commonly ac-
quired by natural sunlight. Vitamins are usually sup-
plied to the body through the use of supplements,
which are additives placed into the diet in solid or liq-
uid form when needed by the animal.
Animal Nutrition
and Concentrations
The concentration of food is dependent on how it is
delivered to the animal. Food concentration is based
on dry matter, or the amount of nutrients without the
water. The concentration is determined by the amount
of food fed divided by the percentage of dry matter.
Dry matter is critical in how much the animal needs to
be fed. The concentration helps determine the amount
 of food to feed and helps ease digestion. Digestion is
the breakdown of food from large molecules to smaller
molecules for use by the body.

types of diets require energy to work and be active, to
maintain the body's temperature, and for good health.
Maintenance diets consist of high fats and carbohydrates
and small amounts of proteins, vitamins, and minerals.

is not adequate or abundant. Concentrates are high in
protein and energy and tend to be fed when other food

herds of livestock. Free choice allows animals to eat
whenever they want food. Many times the food is pro-
vided in accessible feeders or bowls and is always avail-
able for the animal. This is common with hay or grass
sources for livestock. Water is also commonly allowed
free choice. A scheduled feeding is more common for
 companion animals or livestock that are housed sepa-
rately or in reduced numbers. Scheduled feedings have
a set amount of food given at specific times during the
day. This is the best method for ideal nutrition to make 
sure each animal receives and obtains its adequate food
 amount. Most animals on a feeding schedule are fed at
least 2 to 3 times a day. The feedstuff and schedule are
based on the management and practice of the animal
 program. This includes individual rations given to each
animal. Some larger producers and animal owners may
purchase specialized equipment that is computerized
and set to release certain amounts of food at specified

common, especially in warmer weather. External para-

temperatures of 65-80 degrees. The eggs will hatch
around 10 days and become the larvae stage. Larvae
are like little caterpillars crawling around and grazing on
the flea dirt that is generally in their vicinity. This is the
stage when large animals pick up tapeworms while they
graze. Larvae go through several molt stages and then
become pupae, where they spin a cocoon-like structure
where inside they become an adult flea. This stage can
remain dormant several months to a year before emerg-
ing as an adult flea. Under ideal temperatures and con-
ditions, this stage may occur in as little as 21 days from
the time eggs were hatched. The pupae emerge when
they feel vibrations and heat of a host to feed off of.
Adult fleas may survive up to several months without
a food source, which is a blood meal (see Figure 38-9].
Once a female flea has a blood meal, it will produce
eggs within 24-48 hours and then continually lay eggs
until it dies. The average life cycle of an adult flea is 4-6

All animals and humans get lice. Each animal species,
including humans, gets lice that are transmitted only
to that species; thus, lice are species specific. Humans
can't get lice from dogs, cats, horses, or other animals,
and people can't transfer lice to animals. Animal lice are
almost motionless, and some species of lice will attach
to the hair by sticking and feeding off the hair and skin
cells. Other species of lice bite and remove blood from
the animal. Animal lice are gray to light beige in color
and are wingless parasites that are about a twelfth of
an inch in length. They are small in size but can be seen
with the naked eye (see Figure 38-11]. A piece of tape

Biting Flies
Biting flies can cause animals, especially large animals,
lots of irritation. One disease that is of concern from
biting flies, especially the horsefly, is equine infectious
anemia or ElA. Equine infectious anemia, also known as
swamp fever, is a viral disease for which there is no vac-
cine and no cure. This is of huge concern from state to
state and many horses that travel are required to have a
Coggins test, which screens for the ElA virus. The Cog-
gins test is performed by a state-approved laboratory

Another method is by use of a Wood's lamp, which fluo-

ringworm fungus will glow a fluorescent color when ex-
posed to a Wood's lamp. However, many species do not
show up with this method. Oral and topical treatment

also be disinfected to prevent reoccurrence.
Deworming Programs
Small and large animals alike should be on a regular
deworming program. Large animals should be wormed 
every 6-8 weeks due to the increased exposure to para-
sites. Small animals should be wormed yearly or as rec-
ommended by the veterinarian. Dewormers should be

All chapters in Section fl discuss parasites
and parasitic disease specific to the species
discussed in the chapter. Please review

more information on parasites.
[A]
Neoplasia (Cancer)
Neoplasia, commonly called cancer, is common in al
animals, but there are many types of cancers that affect
every area of an animal's body. The rate of cancer in-
creases with age. Certain animal species and breeds are
more prone to certain types of cancer, such as osteo-
sarcoma or bone cancer (see Figure 38-16]. In general,
animals get cancer at roughly the same rate as humans.
Cancer accounts for almost half of all animal deaths over
the age of 10. Some cancer is easily preventable, such
as with early neutering. When an animal is suspected of
having cancer, such diagnostics as blood work, X-rays,
ultrasound, and biopsy (tissue sample] can be helpful in
diagnosis and possible early treatment. Common signs
 of cancer in animals include the following:
■Abnormal swellings that persist or continue to grow

Toxoplasmosis through the feces. This disease is of a
concern in humans, especially pregnant women, who
may contract the disease, which may cause abor-
tions and congenital defects in the fetus. Cats that
have this condition shed oocysts (egg-like immature
particles] in their feces, and the oocysts must be in
the environment 1-5 days before they are infective
[see Figure 38-18]. Cats pass the eggs in their feces
only 2-3 weeks after becoming infective. The oocysts
can survive several years and are difficult to remove
from the environment. Cats generally become infected 
through eating rodents or birds. Signs of animals hav-
ing toxoplasmosis include depression, anorexia, fever,
and lethargy. Prevention is the key, so for humans it
is recommended that pregnant women not clean or
handle litter boxes during pregnancy. When cleaning

Instinctive behaviors include behaviors that are
acquired through an animal's genetic makeup, which is the 
set of instructions that build the parts of the body, includ-
ing the brain. Each species' brain is built on a somewhat
dlifferent pattern. when happy, a dog may wag its tail, a
cat purrs, and a human smiles, while a turtle shows no out-
ward signs at all. These differences are due to the different
brain structures inherent to each species. The brain and
other parts of the nervous system generate behaviors with
a response to environmental input and hormones. Some
of the behaviors may be simple, immediate responses to
simple stimuli, including the knee jerk reflex and the cry of 
pain when an animal is hurt.
Maternal instincts are also a behavior to recognize.
Many mothers with newborns will become protective

Inappropriate Elimination

Alert
Many indoor companion animals have inappropriate
elimination problems, commonly called house soiling.
These behaviors may be due to a physical problem, such
as a urinary tract infection, and these should first be
ruled out by a veterinarian. When a behavior problem is
established, it should be handled by an animal behavior

to start with dogs that have house-soiling issues is to re-
train them in housebreaking guidelines, similar to train-
ing a puppy. It is highly recommended that all animals
in the household be neutered as this will decrease the
chances of a house-soiling problem. Cats tend to have

SECTloN IV Clinical Procedures
Cats with soiling problems can sometimes be easily
accommodated, and other times other behavior modifi-
cations, such as behavior or anxiety medications, must
be prescribed by a veterinarian. The causes of anxiety-
related problems can be difficult to determine and may
need additional therapy and treatment. Stress can be a
large part of anxiety, such as changes in the household.
Stressors such as moving, changes in routine, holidays, or
changes in the makeup of the family can result in inappro-
priate elimination. Reducing these stressors or decreasing
their impact on the household will benefit the cat.
Barking
Barking is a mode of communication that seems to be
more common in dogs than other canine species. Most
dogs bark, howl, and whine to some degree. Sometimes
this may be the result of human encouragement. Certain
breeds have been bred to bark as part of their watch-

527
Interpreting an Animal's Body
Language and Behavior
It is important for veterinary staff members to have knowl-
edge and experience in working around the animals that
are seen in the facility. Each animal species has instincts 
and behavior characteristics that allow it to respond to the
people around it, its environment, its mental and health
status, and its natural instincts. When the environment of
 an animal changes, an animal's behavior pattern also may
change as a response. A trip to the veterinary facility is an
example of a change of environment that an animal may
respond positively or negatively to. Animals visiting the
veterinary facility may exhibit characteristics indicating
 that they are happy, scared, or angry. This requires the vet-
erinary assistant to gain knowledge and experience with
the normal body fanguage in the species they work with.
 Body language is communication by the animal about how
it feels toward other animals, people, and its environment.
 Body language will help determine how easy or dlifficult an
 animal may be during handling and restraint.
The Happy Animal
The happy animal displays normal behavior for ani-
FlcurE 4o-1 A happy animal is relaxed, alert, and
mals. A happy animal will be relaxed, alert, stand, sit 
comfortable.
or lie with a comfortable appearance, and have ears
up and forward [see Figure 40-1]. Various species will
have other body language that displays that they are
happy. A happy animal is easier to handle than one that
is scared or angry. However, the veterinary assistant
should be alert to a change in behavior depending on
the procedures being performed.
The Scared Animal
The scared animal has the potential to be difficult to han-
dle and become aggressive if not dealt with in the correct
manner. Animals that are scared tend to have a stiff
stance, shake or tremor from nervousness, avoid direct eye 
contact, lay their ears flat or back on the head, and lower
their body or tail to the ground [see Figure 40-2]. They
may become submissive, meaning they give in to humans
due to an instinct that makes them feel threatened. This
may lead to fear biting or some other protective instinct
that makes them injure a human out of a natural instinct to 
protect themselves.
The Angry Animal
The angry animal is known as aggressive. Aggression is
a behavior that makes an animal difficult and unsafe to
handle. An animal may be aggressive for several different

species of animal, situation involved, and the behavior
pattern of the animal. The hands can be used to soothe
and calm an animal when they are placed in locations
that are safe. The veterinary assistant should consider
his or her hands as fragile instruments that can easily be
injured when placed in the wrong area. Most restraint
equipment is designed for use on a specific species with
most being used to distract the animal from the pressure
or pain of a procedure while they are being worked on.
Equipment can cause injury if not properly used.
Muzzles
A muzzle is a device placed over the mouth and nose

Animal Safety
Animal safety must be considered of every patient. Many
animals are accustomed to humans, but those that are
not or are removed from their territory will become eas-
ily stressed. This is important in very young or very old
animals. Young animals have small and brittle bones
that are growing and forming and should be handled
with care. Older animals may be arthritic and in pain
 and should also be handled with care. Rough handling
may delay recovery or could lead to death. Pregnant
animals must also be treated with caution during times
of stress. Every time restraint of animals is necessary.
the safety of the animal and the staff must be consid-
ered. Never allow non-veterinary staff or animal owners

Restraint Equipment
When animals become difficult and attempt to bite,
scratch, or kick, it is necessary to sometimes use other
means of control for safety measures. Examples of
equipment that may be used in these situations include
muzzles, anti-kick bars, hobbles, or stanchions. Overly

chambers for better control and less need for hands-
Small animals typically are restrained for exams and
on restraint. Squeeze cages are wire boxes with small
veterinary procedures in which the animal is held in a
safe manner through body control. Injuries that com-
monly occur to veterinary staff during small animal
restraint include bites and scratches. Small animals
include cats, dogs, rodents, rabbits, ferrets, reptiles,
and birds. When working with small animals, it is help-
ful to talk and reassure the animal and use several
techniques that may divert its attention from proce-
dures that are being done. Such diversions that may
be helpful include talking to the animal, making sooth-
ing and calm noises, lightly blowing in the face, lightly
rubbing the temple area, or a combination of these
techniques. Sometimes it is necessary to be creative
in distracting an animal's attention from a procedure
that is being done to be able to complete the restraint
 safely. Monitoring and learning animal body language
is helpful in safe restraint.

need for hands-on restraint. They can further be used to
sedate a difficult or aggressive cat if need be.
Some hands-on restraint techniques that work spe-
cifically in cats include the scruff and the stretch. The
scruff technique is used on the base of the neck over
the area where the skin is elastic and able to be grasped
with a fist. This may divert the attention of the cat from
the procedure that is being done. It gives some control
over the head, but safety must be taken; a cat can eas-
ily turn and bite even with the best grip. The stretch
technique is done by scruffing the cat with one hand
while in lateral recumbency and using the free hand to
hold the rear limbs and pull them dorsally, thus putting
the cat in a stretch position.

Dogs
Dogs that are difficult may be captured and restrained
using a rabies pole or snare pole (see Figure 40-38].
This pole is long and placed inside a cage or kennel to
capture a dog around the neck. A noose on the end of
the pole acts as a collar and the pole acts as a leash.
The end of the pole controls the noose by pulling in or
out on the pole to loosen or tighten the noose to fit the
head of the dog. Once the noose is on the dog, it can be
safely removed from the cage or kennel and walked to a
safe area for further restraint or sedation. When walking
a dog with a snare pole, the dog should be kept in front
of the restrainer and pushed along, rather than pulled.
Pulling a dog can cause severe head and neck injuries.

Instruments and Equipment
"Sharps" are sharp instruments and equipment that can
injure a human or animal and cause a wound or cut that
transmits a contagious disease due to contamination.
Examples of sharps materials include glass, needles,
and surgical blades. Veterinary staff members must be
properly trained to work around these safety hazards
to prevent health risks. Any instrument capable of caus-

Physical Hazards
Physical hazards are safety concerns that can cause
physical harm to a human or animal's body. Examples of 
 physical hazards include animal bites, back injuries from
lifting heavy objects, falls on wet surfaces, and radiation
exposure.
Animal bites and scratches should be cleaned with
warm water and soap and a bandage applied until med-
ical attention is given to the injury (see Figure 41-7].

Zoonotic Hazards
Zoonotic hazards are safety concerns that allow conta-

viruses, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic transmission.
A virus causes diseases that are not treatable and must
run their course. Some may be fatal and others may not.
An example of a virus is the flu or rabies. Bacteria is a

Methods of Sanitation
There are many methods of sanitation used in a vet-
 erinary facility. Sanitation is the process of keeping an
area clean and neat. This includes appearance and odor
control. The type of sanitation will depend on the loca-
tion in the facility, the purpose of the area, and the type 
of chemical or product used for sanitation purposes.
First, it is important to understand the levels of clean-
ing. Cleaning is the process of physically removing all
visible signs of dirt and organic matter such as feces,
blood, and hair. Disinfecting is the process of destroy-
or chemical means [see Figure 42-1]. Sterilizing is the
process of destroying all microorganisms and viruses on
an object using chemicals and/or extreme heat or cold
under pressure.
Physical Cleaning
Physical cleaning is the most common method of sani-
tary control within the veterinary facility. It involves the
use of a chemical with a cleaning object, such as a mop.
sponge, or washcloth. This action may include dusting.
FIGURE 42-2 Mopping is one method used to physically
clean the facility.
mopping, or cleaning up urine or feces within a cage.
Physical cleaning is the use of the hands to remove dirt,
debris, and organisms from all surfaces of the veteri-
nary facility. This includes disinfecting areas to prevent
the spread of disease [see Figure 42-2].
Sterilization
Sterilization is the process of killing all living organisms 
on a surface. This is typically used in the exam rooms,
treatment area, and surgical suite to ensure the tables
and instruments are free of disease. There are several
classifications of sterilization.
Cold Sterilization
Cold sterilization is the process of soaking items in a
disinfectant chemical until they are cleaned for reuse.
A cold tray holds a chemical that acts as a sterilizing
agent [see Figure 42-3]. Items such as nail clippers,
brushes, endotracheal tubes, and some surgical scissors 
may be prepared through cold sterilization techniques.

lists common cold tray solutions.
606
SECTloN IV Clinical Procedures
Autoclave
Another common method for sterilizing items, espe-
cially surgical equipment, is the use of an autoclave.
An autoclave is a piece of equipment in the form of a
sealed chamber in which objects are exposed to heat
and steam under pressure at extremely hot tempera-
tures to kill all living organisms [see Figure 42-4].
Radiation and Ultrasound
Another method of sterilization may be through the use
of radiation or ultrasound. Radiation is using ultravio-
let or gamma rays that radliate and kill living organisms.
Ultrasound is passing high-frequency sound waves
through a solution to create a vibration that scrubs an
object to remove debris. This is commonly done using
an ultrasonic cleaner machine where items soak in a
solution that vibrates to remove dirt and debris
FIcURE 42-3 Cold tray used for sterilization.
Dry Heat or Incineration
Dry heat may be used with the use of a flame by expos-
ing an item to extreme heat or through incineration. An
incinerator is used to burn the remains of items that
have the potential to spread disease. Incineration may
be necessary with biological hazards, medical wastes, or
animal carcasses that may be contagious or zoonotic.
This method requires items to be burned to ashes to
prevent the spread of disease.

Iocation.
Hand Hygiene
Proper hygiene includes hand-washing [see Figure 42-5].
For animals and other staff members to be safe and
sanitary, it is important that everyone in the veterinary
health care field practice proper hand-washing tech-
niques. The most common method of spreading disease
is through direct hand contact.
Hand-washing should take place:
■ After visiting the restroom
■ After coughing
· After sneezing
■ After removing exam gloves
■ After touching or handling each animal
After handling money
■ After contact with people (shaking hands]
After contact with visibly sick people
 After touching phones
■ After touching door handles
· After using a computer keyboard
FIGURE 42-5 Proper hand-washing is the key to prevention 
of the spread of infection.
610
SECTloN IV Clinical Procedures
The proper hand-washing procedure begins with
an antibacterial soap and the use of hand sanitizer
[see Figure 42-6]. Staff members should avoid wear-
ing jewelry, having artificial nails, and allowing nails
to grow beyond the end of the finger, as this will de-
crease the possibility of contamination. Due to frequent
hand-washing, the use of moisturizers is recommended
to keep hands soft and skin healthy. Signs should be
placed throughout the facility to remind all staff mem-
bers to wash their hands.

Housekeeping and General
Cleaning
The most important aspect of general cleaning in a
veterinary facility is to practice good hygiene and odor
control. Cleanliness must be a priority to every staff
member. If an area looks clean but smells dirty, then
the cleanliness has not been achieved. Many areas
of the veterinary clinic need daily cleaning and routine
disinfecting. Some areas will need to remain sterile for
the safety of staff and patients. Areas of high traffic and
animal contact require repeated methods of cleaning
 and sanitation. Cleaning protocols will vary from facil-
ity and area of the hospital. It is important that all staff
members know proper disinfecting and cleaning proto-
cols for the entire hospital.
FIcuRE 42-7 Animal enclosures must be cleaned daily.
Many practices develop a daily and weekly clean-
ing routine. Daily cleaning is conducted on areas and

animals and staff. Each ward should have its own medi-
cal supplies, cleaners, disinfectants, and equipment. The
isolation ward should have items that are never removed
from this location. The laundry and bedding should be
disinfected separately from other laundered items. Signs
should be kept on all cages and doors detailing the types
of contagious diseases of the patients that are housed in
the ward. All staff members that enter should wear exam
 gloves, sterile gowns, face masks, shoe covers, and hair
and either thrown away or appropriately disinfected after
each use in the isolation ward.
SUMMARY
Sanitation involves cleaning and disinfecting the veteri-
nary facility. This controls the direct spread of organisms
on surfaces, in the air, and on other objects within the
facility. All members of the veterinary staff must follow
standard sanitation procedures. Failure to maintain a high
standard of disinfecting and sanitation will result in harm
to the patients, loss of clients, a decrease in business, and
the loss of employee jobs. Every staff member must have
a high level of awareness for the potential transmission of
diseases from patient to patient and patient to people. Ev-
eryone must be diligent in proper cleaning and sanitation

Feathers should be evaluated for similar signs relating
to the hair and skin quality.
The Nervous System
The nervous system is evaluated throughout the entire
physical exam. Areas to note are the response of pupil
reflexes, the gait, as well as other body reflexes, such as
limbs, paws, and digits. Reflex test functions that can
easily be evaluated include the joint reflexes, which can
be assessed using the reflex hammer to see the knee
jerk reaction. This is the reaction to a slight tap over the
knee joint that causes the knee to jerk in response. The
limbs should be evaluated by bending at each joint to
note any pain or swelling (see Figure 43-13]. The paws

SECTloN IV Clinical Procedures
The Abdominal System
The abdominal system includes the stomach, intes-
tines, and internal organs, such as the liver, pancreas,
and spleen. The abdomen should be palpated (to feel)]
for any signs of masses, distention, pain, and bruising.
The stomach area should be palpated gently and slowly
without grabbing any locations that may feel abnormal
[see Figure 43-15]. Using both hands and carefully al-
lowing the fingers to move gently over the abdomen will
allow the assistant to feel any signs of masses, feces in
the intestine, fluid, gas, or possible fetuses in a preg-
nant female. Large animals should be handled carefully
 to prevent injury from kicking or striking.
The Urogenital System
The urogenital system includes the kidneys, urinary blad-
der, external genitals, mammary glands, and rectal area.
Palpation of the dorsal abdomen will allow evaluation
of the kidneys and bladder. It is difficult to palpate the
kidneys of some animal species. The mammary glands
should be palpated for signs of masses, tumors, nodules,
or cysts and any sign of milk discharge or pain and swell-
ing. Female animals that have recently been bred or were
in labor may show signs of mastitis, including heat, red-
ness, and discharge. Lactating animals should have their
milk expressed to determine normal appearance. Female

Completing a thorough physical examination even when
there are no obvious problems allows veterinary staff
to determine whether a problem is occurring or locate
 signs of diseases or changes in a patient. In addition, in
animals with known abnormalities, such as fatty tumors
 or heart murmurs, regular exams allow the staff to chart
the course of disease and determine whether it is pro-
gressive or remains the same. The veterinary assistant
and support staff play a vital role in assessing the pa-

CHAPTER 44 Examination Procedures
631
Vital Signs
Animals are evaluated for normal health status by tak-
ing their vital signs, which are the signs of life that are
measurements to assess the basic functions of the body.
Vital signs include the heart rate, respiratory rate, tem-
perature, blood pressure, mucous membrane color, cap-
illary refill time, and weight of the animal. The first three
vital signs are often referred to as the TPR. The TPR
refers to the temperature, pulse, and respiration.
Temperature Assessment
The patient's temperature is an essential part of an
animal's exam and health status. The body tempera-
ture can allude to signs of infection, disease, environ-
FIGURE 44-1 Rectal temperature is the most accurate

 measurement of body temperature.
temperature is evaluated in an animal that regulates
its body temperature internally or within the body. An
ectothermic temperature describes an animal that
regulates its body temperature externally or through its
environment (see Table 44-1].
Hypothermia is a condition where the body tem-
perature is below normal causing the animal to become
cold, and it may be a sign of environmental exposure
to cold climates, metabolic disease, or shock. Hyper-
thermia is when the body temperature is above normal
and causes the animal to have a fever, which is an ex-
cessive amount of heat in the body. Hyperthermia can
be a sign of infection, toxicity, or heat stroke. Heat
stroke is a common occurrence in areas that have high
environmental temperatures and can be a serious con-
dition for animals. Heat stroke may be considered when
the nervous system, and the blood supply.
The core body temperature is best evaluated by
taking a rectal temperature using a rectal thermometer
[see Figure 44-1]. The animal should remain standing or
in a sternal position so as not to break the thermometer
or cause injury to the animal's rectal area. The rectal
thermometer is applied carefully within the rectum by
lubricating the end of the thermometer that has a sil-
ver metal tip. The thermometer only need be inserted

encircling the back and chest area.
4. Read the measurement at the end of the tape where the ends meet with the tape
snugly around the girth.
 5. Remove the tape and record the measurement in the medical record.
Auscultation
Auscultation of the chest cavity includes listening to
the heart and lungs. A stethoscope is used to listen
to the chest area by placing the end of the stethoscope
that appears bell-like in appearance on the animal's
heart area. The heart area can be located by taking the
left front leg and pulling it back to the chest or thorax
area, and where the elbow meets the chest is the heart
location. This area is also near the ribs. The stethoscope
should be moved to at least three areas of the chest
to listen to the heart and lungs to rule out abnormal
sounds [see Figure 44-11]. The same procedure should
be completed on the right side of the chest as well. The
heart can also be listened to through the sternum or
breast bone on the lower ventral chest area. A strong
heart beat should be noted.
Irregular heart sounds such as decreased rhythm
may be a sign of a mass or fluid located in the chest
area. Bradycardia is the term for a decreased or slow
heart rate and tachycardia is the term for an increased
or fast heart rate. It may also be a sign of heart disease.
Irregular lung sounds may be present in sounds such
as crackles or wheezing. Crackles, sometimes referred
to as rales, sound like crumpling cellophane and many
times mean fluid buildup in the chest. Wheezing is a
raspy sound that produces a whistle-like noise that is
common in narrow or constricted airways. Some sounds

Dental Examination
The dental exam should be performed to note any signs
of dental disease or tooth problems [see Figure 44-15].
Signs of dental disease include broken teeth, decayed
teeth, inflamed gums, oral odor, and tartar or stains
of the teeth. Plaque is a soft buildup of material found
over the surfaces of the teeth that is composed of bac-
teria, food materials, and saliva. It may be easy to re-
move by brushing the teeth but often returns quickly
[see Figure 44-16]. Tartar or calculus is a mineralized
plaque material that appears brown to dark yellow in
color and is difficult to remove. The gingiva or gums are
the soft tissue that surround the teeth and are generally
pink in color or may be dark pigments in certain breeds
of animals. Gingivitis is the inflammation of the gums

inflamed gums that are swollen and often bleed easily
when touched. Animals that have dental disease may re-
quire anesthesia to clean the teeth through the process
of a dental prophylaxis, which is the term for the pro-
fessional cleaning of a patient's teeth.
A common condition in animals is a tooth abscess.
The roots of teeth can abscess when a tooth is broken
or damaged. This causes an infection within the root
and gingival tissues. Injuries can occur when the animal
chews on hard items. A root infection can also be caused
by severe dental disease. The carnassial tooth is a com-
mon site for root abscess. The carnassial teeth are the
largest teeth in an animal's mouth and are the upper
fourth premolars and the lower first molars. These teeth
may have 3-4 roots that may be affected. The abscess
 of the root causes severe facial swelling and pain, typi-

10. Thank the client for coming and ask him or her to call if any problems or questions arise.
Recording Observations
It is essential for all staff members to learn to observe
patients. This is a necessary skill from the moment a pa-
tient enters the facility until it is disc harged. Observation
is a key factor in successful patient care and treatment.
Observation includes watching and noting an animal's
behavior, appearance, mental status, and overall health 
[see Figure 45-6]. These signs should be compared with
what is normal for the species and breed of the animal.
Any changes that occur should be monitored and noted
in the medical chart. Some changes may be subtle and
can be easily overlooked. Observations include visual
monitoring, smelling odors, pal pating changes, and audi-
tory monitoring. Examples of observations that may be
helpful in treating a patient include noting odorous gas
or diarrhea, a tense abdomen, or ocular discharge. Daily

Determining Animal Gender
Although it may seem humorous and odd, some owners
may not know the gender or may incorrectly identify the
gender of an animal. In some animals, such as kittens,
rabbits, and pocket pets, it may be more difficult to
identify the sex. Some young animals may not have
developed reproductive organs to easily identify their
gender. Some animals may have been neutered, as
well. The gender of most pocket pets, rabbits, and cats 
can be identified by the shape of the genital opening
and the distance between the anus and genital area,
commonly called the anogenital distance. Some
animals can be sexed by this distance from the rectum
or anus and the genital area where urination occurs.
Many male rodent species and cats have a wider
space than in the female (see Figure 45-9]. Gently lift

appearance. Table 45-3 summarizes the shape of the
genitals in various species.
Determining Approximate Animal Age
The age of an animal can be approximated in part by
examining its dentition. The dentition is the arrange-
ment of teeth in the mouth. The eruption time of
FIGURE 45-7 Laryngoscope.
deciduous and permanent teeth occurs at a specific
time in each animal species. The deciduous teeth, or the
baby teeth, are sharper and smaller than the adult
teeth, which are larger. Also, as animals grow the teeth
become more widely spaced as the jaw grows, when the
baby teeth are pushed out and replaced by the adult
teeth. The appearance of the teeth will also help deter-
mine age in an animal (see Figure 45-10]. Signs of stain-
ing, tartar, and general wearing will be noted in older
animals. In the case of horses, the shape of the angle of

The tertiary bandage layer is the final layer that
acts as the outer covering that holds the bandage on
the animal and is usually waterproof to protect the un-
derlying layers. It should extend proximally and distally
beyond the edges of the secondary layer. The material
for this layer is usually self-adherent, meaning it sticks
to itself, such as co-flex or vet wrap [see Figure 45-22].
The edges should be wide enough to prevent slipping
but not so extensive that it causes discomfort to the pa-
tient. Adhesive tape can be applied to the outer edges
of the last layer of bandage on the proximal and dis-
tal ends to also help prevent the bandage from slipping
to the bandage and half to the hair of the animal. It is
important to note that bandage layers that are placed
too tight may cut off areas of circulation, causing seri-
ous damage to tissue.

between amounts. The feedings are broken down into
several meals throughout the day. Food should be fed
slowly to prevent the patient from aspirating food into
the lungs. Aspiration means swallowing food that en-
ters the lungs rather than the stomach. Some patients
may begin to eat on their own after a few amounts of
food are passed. Some animals will fight the process
of force feeding. It may be necessary to use a naso-
gastric tube placed into the stomach to feed the ani-
mal (see Figure 45-27]. This is done by the veterinarian
or veterinary technician. The nasogastric tube enters
the nostril and passes through the pharynx and into
the esophagus until the tip is placed into the stomach.
Liquefied food can then be administered through the
tube as needed. The amount of food required should
be evaluated by the veterinarian to make certain the
patient's total calorie needs are met. Animals that are
capable of eating should be monitored for the amount
of food they eat. Animals should never go longer than
24 hours without eating. Feeding hospitalized patients
requires creativity, persistence, and patience.

Basic brushing and combing should begin at
the back of the body and work forward, brushing with
the direction of the hair coat. Also, it is best to be-
gin at the feet and work upward. Any mats should be
broken down by working across the mat with a wide-
toothed comb until the mat is free from the underlying
skin and hair. Mats are areas of hair that are interwo-
ven together and form a large clump that is irritating

FIGUrE 46-8 When brushing, work from the tail forward.
Bathing
Bathing is done to clean the skin and hair coat of the
animal or to apply medicated shampoos or dips to the
skin and hair coat. Bathing removes dirt and debris from
the skin and hair with the use of shampoo, conditioner,
and water [see Figure 46-9]. Dipping is the process of
applying a chemical pesticide or medication to the skin
and hair coat to treat a specific condition, such as mites
or fleas. Dips usually remain on the skin and hair coat
for a time period to allow them to work as specified.
Bathing should begin after the animal has been
completely combed and brushed and is free of mats.
Other grooming needs, such as anal gland expression,
ear cleaning, or nail trims, should be performed prior to
bathing. Large cotton balls should be placed into each
ear canal to prevent water from entering the ear and

Clipping, Trimming, and Shaving
Clipping of the hair is typically the process of removal
of small amounts of hair from one or several areas

of the patient. Trimming refers to the process of re-

locations. Shaving is the process of taking down an

amount of hair close to the skin. Clipping and trim-
ming may be done using scissors or electric clippers
[see Figure 46-15]. In veterinary medicine this usually
refers to areas of the body that need care and mainte-
nance, such as the rectal area, genital area, or facial
area. Clipping and trimming around the rectum is com-
mon in animals that may have long hair that may col-
lect around the rectum causing a buildup of feces (see
Figure 46-16]. This causes a sanitary problem that
may cause bad odor or soiling of furniture. The genital

for patients. Shaving is another skill in veterinary med-
icine that is necessary for several reasons. One is the
removal of mats and another is shaving a surgical area
to properly prepare it for a surgical procedure.
When clipping or trimming hair, blunt scissors
should be used. Blunt scissors have a non-sharp end so
that the possibility of injury is decreased around an ani-
mal. Smaller electronic clippers may be used but should 
be used carefully so that areas are not trimmed too
short (see Figure 46-17]. To prevent trimming areas to0
short while using electronic clippers, it is recommended
that veterinary assistants use clipper guards, which fit 
over the end of the clippers. The clipper guards come in
various sizes from %4 inch to 2 inches to allow uniform
trimming (see Figure 46-18]. Clipper guards should be
placed over a #40 clipper blade. When trimming a hair
coat to a shorter length, work against the hair coat.
This is best done by using a slicker brush and brush-
ing against the hair coat allowing the area to stand. Use
long, even strokes when trimming long-haired coats.
or animals that may have severely matted coats or
skin conditions. When shaving an animal it is best to
know how short the area must be shaved. Surgical pa-
tients will need the entire surgical preparation surface
shaved to the skin, free of all hair and debris. This is
typically done with a #40 or #50 surgical clipper blade.
Shorter shaves may be done with smaller-number clip-

be done to maintain clippers and blades. It is best to
read the manufacturer's manual to know the proper
use and care of the clippers. A backup clipper should
 always be available in case of damage or overheating.
Electronic clippers come in a variety of sizes, shapes,
and speeds. Some may be cordless and others have
electrical cords. Corded models should be checked on

Nail Trimming
The nails on animals can easily become overgrown. They
may require regular trimming so that they don't begin
to catch on rugs, blankets, or other items or split from
overgrowth. Sometimes long nails will begin to curl and
grow into the foot pad, causing severe pain and discom-
fort. The purpose of nails is for protection or defense
and traction on smooth surfaces. In cats, they are also
used for climbing. Some animals have hoofs, which need
to be trimmed and keep from overgrowth as well. This
 section focuses on small animal nail trimming, as most 
hoofed animals are maintained by a farrier, who is a pro-
fessional trained in trimming hoofed animals. The anat-
omy of the nail includes the nail bed, the area where the
nail growth occurs and is located at the end of the digit
near the hair growth of the foot. Within the nail bed lies

grow and strengthen. The goal of the nail trim is to cut
the nail just distal to the quick [see Figure 46-27]. Some
Quick
nails are white or unpigmented, whereas others are
black to brown in color and contain pigment. In white
nails it is much easier to see and determine where the
quick lies. The quick is a faint pink triangular area within
the end of the nail (see Figure 46-28]. In dark-colored
nails it is not easy to see the quick. Small cuts of nail
must be done in dark nails to look for the dark spot in
the nail bed that surrounds the quick. At this point you
should stop trimming as it is the near the quick. Most
animals use the hind digits more for traction and move-
ment than the front digits, so typically the front nails
need more taken off. Dewclaws may also be present and
have no contact with the ground and typically become
long and tend to curl in toward the skin and hair coat.

Dental Care
Dental care in animals is important and has an increased
demand in all types of species, such as companion ani-
mals, large animals, and pocket pets. Several aspects of
dental care fall into the hands of the veterinary assistant.
The veterinary technician performs dental care under
 anesthesia, and the veterinarian performs oral surgery
and extractions. Preventative dental care and teeth
tant's responsibility (see Figure 47-1]. All of these factors
make animal dental care an essential part of veterinary
medicine and patient care. Promoting ideal dental health
begins with educating clients on home dental care needs
including daily brushing of teeth, feeding a dry diet, and 
providing routine veterinary dental care such as dental
prophylaxis or floating. It is also important to educate
owners on how to properly keep teeth strong and healthy
and also prevent dental injury. Proper toys and dental
chews should be provided, such as KONGs or veteri-
nary dental bones [see Figure 47-2]. Items such as raw
bones, chains, or rocks should not be chewed on as they
may damage and injure teeth and gums. Young animals
should be monitored for proper tooth eruption as decid-
uous [baby] teeth are shed and permanent (adult] teeth
begin alignment. A yearly physical exam should include a
dental exam by the veterinarian.
FIGURE 47-2 Chew toys promote good dental health.
Daily Dental Care and Brushing

allow healthy teeth and provide animals that chew with
teeth; however, there are several modifications in pet
dental care that can cause difficulty or harm to the ani-
mal. The veterinary assistant should teach owners how
to properly brush their pet's teeth. Teaching the proper
method and necessary tools and supplies will help own-
ers accept the needs of the pet's dental care and make
the process easier. When owners have difficulty brush-
ing their pet's teeth, they soon give up and stop den-
tal care altogether. Animals should never have human
toothpaste placed in their mouth, as human toothpaste
has certain enzymes that are not digestible in animals.
This may cause severe irritation or potential toxicity.
Veterinary dentifrices, or toothpaste, come in a vari-
ety of flavors that increase the animal's acceptance to
brushing of the teeth (see Figure 47-3]. These denti-
frices have safe, digestible enzymes that easily break
down in the animal's body. Flavors that are enjoyed by
pets include fish, beef, malt, and poultry.

The brushing procedure is similar to brushing one's
own teeth with the exception that the lingual surface, or
inner aspect of the teeth near the tongue, is not brushed.
Only the buccal, labial, and occlusal surfaces of the teeth
are brushed. The buccal surface of the teeth is located
on the outer area near the cheek [see Figure 47-5]. The
labial surface of the teeth is the front area that is covered
by the lips [see Figure 47-6]. The occlusal surface is the
top area of the teeth. It is difficult and not safe to open
an animal's mouth to brush the inside surfaces of the
teeth. Injury may be caused to the person or the animal.
The areas of importance are easily accessed by lifting the
lips to expose the outer tooth surface (see Figure 47-7].
Animals will accept teeth brushing with time and con-
sistency, as well as patience. Begin with a small amount

and small dogs. Pet toothbrushes may have a small round
head with soft bristles and a short narrow handle that
fits comfortably into the mouth of an animal. Various
sizes are available depending on the size of the animal.
A fingerbrush is a small tool that fits on the end of a fin-
ger and is a plastic, thimble-like device that has small, soft
bristles that are rubbed over the teeth (see Figure 47-4].

SQ fluids are placed into the loose skin at the base of
the neck of small animals that require small amounts
of fluid replacement. This is usually less than a 200 ml
volume of fluid. These fluids are placed under the skin
and slowly absorbed by the body. Common reasons for
collection, and minimal vomiting and diarrhea cases.
The most common type of SQ fluid used for therapy is
Lactated Ringers Solution (LRS).
SQ fluids are given using an IV bag with an at-
tached IV line that is attached to the proper-sized
needle according to the animal's size and species,
just as in injections. The IV line or extension set is a
flexible plastic tubing that connects to the fluid bag.
The fluid bag is made of vinyl material that is clear.
Most animals tolerate being given SQ fluids, which
are similar to an SQ injection. One location can hold

and the bandage should be checked on a daily basis
for signs of leaking, disconnection, bleeding, or swell-
ing. This may require a daily bandage change to assess
the site. Some catheter sites may become inflamed and
require antibiotic or antiseptic around the placement
site. The catheter site should then be re-bandaged.
Phlebitis may develop around the site and should be
monitored for signs of redness, swelling, pain, and in-
flammation. The IV catheter should be replaced every 3
to 4 days if the treatment is lengthy.
One of the most common problems with the IV cath-
eter is patency, which may be caused from the IV tubing

catheter. Some animals with cephalic vein IV catheters
may kink the tubing by pulling the leg in a direction that
prevents fluid flow. A splint or bandage can be placed
to help maintain the flow of fluids. Animals that chew
or bite at the catheter site or bandage may need an
E-collar to prevent the animals from damaging or re-
moving the catheter.
If pitting edema is noted, or swelling around the
catheter site causing the fluid to be outside of the vein,
the IV fluids should be stopped and a new catheter
placed at another vein site.
IV Fluid Monitoring
IV fluids require constant and consistent monitoring by
the veterinary assistant. Frequent observations will help
detect improper fluid flow or occlusion. The veterinarian
should determine the volume to be delivered to each
patient on a daily basis. The amount of fluids to be de-
livered over the course of a day is called the flow rate.
When a total volume is determined, the veterinary assis-
tant may note how much fluid is in an IV bag at the start

Socialization and Exercise
of Patients
Animals are accustomed to human interaction and when
hospitalized may not receive enough human contact. It
is important that the veterinary assistant provide posi-
tive social interaction to all hospitalized patients during
treatment, cage cleaning, or during exercise. This in-
cludes petting animals, talking to the patients, using a
gentle and soothing voice, or holding them if possible
[see Figure 47-22]. These positive actions help put pa-
tients at ease.
Exercise may be provided to some hospitalized ani-
mals depending on their condition and treatment needs.
Exercise is important as some animals will not urinate
in the confines of the cage, such as dogs. This requires
a brief walk several times a day outside of the facility

when an animal is roaming free within an area. Interac-
tion of patients is an important part of their recovery
and treatment.
Euthanasia
Euthanasia is the process of putting an animal to sleep
using humane methods by means of a painless death.
Some hospitalized patients may not recover and con-
tinue to become ill, and the owners may decide to end
the animal's suffering by means of euthanasia. This
decision is based on personal values, religious beliefs,
and previous experiences along with the veterinarian's
 guidance and recommendations. This process is often
dlifficult for the owners as well as the veterinary staff.
The process of the euthanasia should be as pain-
free and stress-free as possible. During this time, the
veterinary staff should be supportive and sympathetic to
the owner's needs and values. It is important to remem-

Veterinary Laboratory
Equipment
Many laboratory tests and services are performed within
the veterinary facility and are referred to as in-house
testing. Some tests that may not be completed in-house
are often sent to a commercial laboratory referred to as
a reference lab. The equipment that is available for the 
test determines which services are offered in-house or
through reference labs.

It is important that the veterinary assistant has a gen-
eral and clear understanding of how to appropriately
use a microscope. All microscopes should be covered
when not in use. Each microscope will have several lens
objectives that offer a variety of magnifications to view
a variety of different powers [see Table 48-1]. A slide
should be placed on the stage, which is the flat section
under the lens. A slide should always be viewed using
the lowest power magnification first and then moving to
a higher power. A slide is viewed by looking through the
eye piece. To focus each lens to view a sample, the focus
knobs should be turned gently and slowly while look-

Centrifuge
A centrifuge is another common veterinary tool used
to spin lab samples at a high rate of speed and force
[see Figure 48-5]. This device is used to separate 0r
concentrate materials suspended in a liquid form.
Gravity helps to separate the different forms. Centri-
fuges come in a variety of shapes and sizes and many
facilities have two, one used to spin microhematocrit
tubes and one standard machine used to spin larger
volumes of fluid samples. All centrifuges have a variety
of rotors, or wheels, that spin at a variety of speeds
depending on the sample type (see Figure 48-6]. Each
time the centrifuge is used, it must be balanced before
turning it on. Samples that may be used in a centrifuge
include blood tubes of various sizes, centrifuge tubes
that have conical or pointed ends and may hold urine
or fecal samples, or microhemocrit tubes, which are
thin, small glass tubes that hold blood (see Figure 48-7].

Refractometer
A refractometer is a tool used to measure the weight
of a liquid and determine a liquid's pH level (see
Figure 48-9]. The veterinary refractometer has two
scales that are viewed in a similar fashion to a prism.

The Fecal Sample
Fecal samples are used to diagnose internal parasites
and the presence of blood within the stool sample. A fe-
cal sample is assessed using a small amount of an ani-
mal's stool or bowel movement materials. Changes in
the fecal sample aid in determining animal health issues 
and signs of disease.
The fecal sample begins with the collection, which
may be done at the facility or brought in with the ani-
mal's owner. The fecal sample should be placed within
an airtight container or bag, which is labeled with
the client name, patient name, sample test, and date.
Samples that are collected fresh and not immediately

tested should be kept refrigerated for freshness. At
least 1-2 grams of feces is needed to complete a fecal
analysis.
The first part of the fecal analysis sample begins
with the gross examination or visible observation of
the feces. The observations are recorded in the pa-
tient's medical record and possibly in a laboratory fe-
cal log. The gross fecal observation should include the
following:
■ Color
 Consistency
● Odor
■ Presence of blood ranging from dark black to
bright red
■ Presence of observable parasites
Presence of mucous

Make a quick motion when using the spreader slide.
When the slide is completely dry, it should be
stained with Wright's stain, which is a three-step stain-
ing method using commercial mixed solutions that allow
blood cells to be easily viewed under a microscope. The
solutions may also be in a commercial kit known as a
Diff Quick set. These include three solutions labeled A,
B, and C, which fix the stain with a red and blue color-
ation (see Figure 48-29].
When preparing blood smear slides, it is best to
make two slides: one is stained and viewed and the other
remains unstained in case of further testing. Both slides

paper towel near the microscope for evaluation.
The blood smear, when stained, will allow the red
blood cells to appear a pink, red, or salmon color. The
white blood cells will stain the nuclei with a dark blue to
purple coloration. The platelets stain dark blue to violet in
color. The cytoplasm and granules will vary in color from
pink to purple. When evaluating the stained slide with
the naked eye, it should have an overall even coloring of 
purple with pink hues. The stains should be maintained in
separate Coplin jars marked with the appropriate order of
use, such as A, B, and C. The jars should be filled at least
3/4 full to allow slides to be covered by the stain. Distilled
 water should be used to rinse slides during staining.
Packed Cell Volume
The packed cell volume or PCV is also referred to as
a hematocrit. This is a measurement of the percent-
age of red blood cells in whole or unclotted blood. The
red blood cells, called erythrocytes, carry oxygen to
the bloodstream. The PCV test is simple, rapid, and
requires a very small amount of blood. The equip-
ment includes a centrifuge with a microhematocrit ro-
tor, hematocrit tubes, and clay. The microhematocrit
centrifuge has a lid that screws onto the rotor to pre-
vent tubes from emerging. The rotor must be properly

Radiology Terminology
There are many terms that relate to the equipment, pro-

radiology. It is important for veterinary assistants to un-
derstand basic radiology terms and understand position-
ing when working in radiology. This is important to proper
film exposure and development and patient diagnosis.

Diagnostic Terms
There are several diagnostics performed in addition to
general radiograph films. Radiographic contrast medi-
ums are used to study parts of the body and films are
taken in sequences to monitor the contrast medium as
it moves through the area. A contrast medium is a ma-
terial or substance administered into the body to show
structures on an X-ray film that would otherwise be diffi-
cult to view. Barium sulfate is an example of a contrast
medium used in a barium study. Barium sulfate is a

 fluoresce body parts of the digestive system. A barium
study is a series of films taken as the material passes
through the digestive tract. A lower Gl is a contrast film
 of the lower digestive tract organs and is often given
via an enema, which is a large amount of a substance
passed into the colon via the rectum. This is called a
barium enema. An upper Gl is a contrast study of
the structure of the upper digestive tract in which the
barium is given orally.

SECTloN IV Clinical Procedures
Film processing involves several steps independent
of the method of developing. These steps include film
developing, film rinsing, film fixing, and film drying.
Processing involves being in a darkroom that has no
light source or light leaks from the outside area. Light
will ruin the film and make it undevelopable. The
darkroom is equipped with a safe light, which is a red
light that is low in intensity and a filter that doesn't
damage the film. The entrance door should be secured
firmly to prevent anyone from entering during film
development. A light or sign should be placed on the
door when the room is in use. The undeveloped film is
removed from the cassette before it is developed. A new
film is replaced within the cassette.
Film Cassettes

Manual Developing
Developing tanks are required for hand-processing
films. These tanks may be metal or heavy plastic and
hold large volumes of chemicals. The solutions require
periodic changing at which time the chemicals are
drained. The tanks are cleaned well to remove bacteria
and algae, rinsed, and then refilled. The frequency of
this practice depends on how much use occurs and any
debris and contaminants that may get into the chemi-
cals. The tanks contain the developer solution, the fixer
solution, and a wash tank that contains water. The
developer solution is usually located on the left-hand
side of the tank. The developer solution develops the
X-ray film. The fixer solution is usually located on
the right-hand side and is a smaller tank compared
to that of the water. The fixer solution fixes the X-ray
film and helps maintain the life span of the film, allow-
ing it to stay readable. The water rinse tank is usually
located to the far right side and is larger than the other
two tank sections. when the processing method is com-
plete, the film should hang to dry.

checked for proper levels. The roller racks should be
removed and washed on a regular basis. The process
of using the automatic process for film developing is
simple. The film cassette is taken to the darkroom and
the exposed film removed from the cassette. The film
should be grasped by the edges and placed on the
feeder tray of the processor. The film is aligned with
the roller bar and placed against it. The film will be
pulled into the processor and developed automati-
cally. The completed film will be removed on the op
posite end of the feeder tray dry and ready to view.
X-rays are viewed on a viewing box that illuminates the
film and allows the veterinarian to make a diagnosis
[see Figure 49-10].
Digital Radiology
Many facilities are beginning to switch from using
 chemical processing to produce radiographs to using
digital radiology. Digital X-rays are transferred onto a
computer disc rather than on a film. This type of diag-
nostic imaging has multiple advantages including ease
of use, production of high-quality images, affordability,
and improved neatness and cleanliness of images. This
radiology practice is quite common in veterinary medi-
cine and in the coming years will be considered the
norm in radiology.

mals, such as dogs or cats, will require the mouth
to be opened and the medicine placed at the back
of the mouth and swallowed. Large animals, such as
horses or cattle, require more power to hold and ad-
minister medications. Some animals may require pet
piller or dosing syringes to aid in giving medicine by
mouth. A pet piller is a small device, usually made
of plastic, that has a long thin handle with a plunger
on the end. The plunger holds the medicine and the
handle is used to throw the medicine in the back of
the throat (see Figure 50-6]. Large animals may re-

ally on the ear flap (see Figure 50-12]. The area located
caudally and with no hair is called the pinna. The internall
ear canal is shaped in an "L" fashion where at the begin-
ning or exterior area the structure is wider and as the
canal gets closer to the eardrum it gets shorter. The ear
canal can be palpated through the skin, below the open-

lower jaw. The ear canal is made of cartilage and when
palpated feels similar to a rubber hose or tube.

most items are used in close contact to the patient.
Pre-anesthetic Patient Care
Any patient undergoing a surgical procedure should be
admitted into the hospital early in the day to complete
necessary presurgical blood work and physical exams
prior to the surgery. All consent forms and fees, as well
as an estimate and review of procedures, should be pro-
vided to the client to complete as soon as the patient
is admitted. Emergency surgical procedures are worked
into the schedule dependent on how soon the patient
needs to be attended to. The early admission also al-
lows patients to fast, or not have any food or water,
prior to surgery depending on the animal species and
required fasting time. For some species this means a
12-hour fast and for others fasting is not required. This
is dependent on the animal's digestive system. Dogs

Lactated Ringer's Solution (LRS]. In small patients or
young patients, a 5% dextrose solution may be used
or added to the LRS. The veterinarian should select
any fluids being used with the patient. The flow rate
of the fluids is typically 10-20 ml/kg/hr. Dehydrated
patients will require a higher flow rate. Patients with
renal or cardiac damage should receive a reduced rate
of flow, which should be established by the veterinar-
ian. The veterinary assistant should be able to set up
an IV bag and line along with the proper-sized IV cath-
eter necessary for the technician to place the catheter.
The assistant should also be able to properly monitor
the fluid rate and flow.

Intubation Procedure
The veterinarian or veterinary technician performs the
endotracheal tube placement as the assistant restrains
for the procedure. Intubation consists of passing a
tube through a patient's mouth and pharynx and into
the trachea. This establishes an airway and allows the
patient to be attached to the anesthesia machine dur-
ing a procedure. It also prevents the patient from in-

SECTloN IV Clinical Procedures
the patient's trachea. The tube is made of heavy-duty
plastic or rubber material that is slightly curved in the
shape of the trachea. One end is slightly tapered to
 allow ease of placement into the trachea. The opposite
end has an adapter that attaches to the anesthesia
machine. Some tubes have a cuff located about / of
the way down the tube that is inflatable and allows
the tube to be inflated with air to create a tight seall
around the trachea to prevent any moisture or mate-
rial from entering the lung field. The cuff is attached
to the endotracheal tube by a thin tube running paral-
lel to the endotracheal tube. When inflated, the inter-
nal and external parts of the cuff look like a balloon.
The cuff is inflated using a syringe that pushes air into
the cuff. Too much air can be placed into the cuff caus-
ing the tube to overinflate, so care must be taken to
not irritate or damage the trachea. The tube and the
cuff should be checked prior to use to make certain no
tears or leaks are present. It is important for the assis-
tant to understand how the cuff and tube work during
the intubation process, as the cuff must be deflated
prior to extubation or endotracheal tube removal
from the patient.

the heart, which is then transmitted through the speaker

A blood pressure monitor or sphygmomanometer
is used to measure an animal's blood pressure during sur-
gery. This will also help determine tissue perfusion as well
as depth of anesthesia. If the pet is in a light surgical plane
[under light anesthesia], it may have an increase in blood
pressure when the surgeon starts the surgery or manip-
ulates the tissues. The surgeon also monitors the blood
loss that is occurring during the procedure, since that also
affects tissue perfusion. The blood pressure monitor mea-
sures the pressure through the use of a cuff similar to that
used in humans. The BP cuffs come in various sizes to ac-
commodlate the dlifferent species of animals.
An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) monitor is placed
onto a patient through metal leads called electrodes that
measure the electrical activity of the heart. An EKG mea-
sures the electric currents generated by the heart. It is 
used to monitor the heart rate, rhythm, and changes in
the nerve impulses in the heart. Continuous monitoring
with an EkG allows early recognition of electrical changes
associated with disorders of conduction in the heart and
arrhythmias that may need to be treated. Lead Il is the

ferent types of suture material are used on different
tissues. There are two classes of suture in the form of
absorbable and non-absorbable materials. Absorb-
able suture is suture that is broken down within the
body over a period of time and is absorbed by the
body. This type of suture is used both internally and
externally. Non-absorbable suture is not broken
down within the body and remains intact for long pe-
riods. This type of suture is commonly used on the
external body. Non-absorbable sutures are generally
used to close skin and must be removed after wound
healing is complete. There are some procedures where
non-absorbable sutures may be placed internally but
they cannot be removed. Some sutures have a needle
already attached and are called swedged on needles

gown pack should already be open and ready for the
surgical staff. Then the gown is picked up by the folded
dog ear at the neck line of the gown. The gown is held
up and away from the body to prevent contamination.
Care should be made not to allow the gown to have
contact with the floor. The person places his or her
hands through each armhole. The person then applies
the sterile gloves with either an open or closed tech-
nique. This is when an assistant should stand behind
the person and, without touching the external area
of the gown and touching only the ties, should tie in
the staff member. The ties should be placed in a bow.
Many gowns have ties at the base of the neck and at
the waist. Never touch any part of the gown other than
the ties.

Some patients may require a heating pad that is placed
between the patient and the table. Other patients may
require a V-trough positioner to keep the animal cen-
tered on the table.
 Surgical lights should be positioned directly over
the sight when the incision will be made. Final light po-
sitioning should be done after the animal is draped and
the surgeon is in place to direct any light needs.
Anesthesia Planes
Anesthesia planes or depths are measured by evaluat-
ing the patient's involuntary reflexes. The veterinary as-
sistant may be asked to monitor reflexes to determine
the depth of anesthesia. The palpebral reflex is evalu-
ated by tapping the fingertip lightly over the surface
of the eyelid. If a strong to slight blink reflex is noted,
the patient is in a light plane of anesthesia and the in-
halant gas should be increased for surgical purposes.
The blink reflex will decrease and eventually disappear
as the plane of anesthesia deepens. The pedal reflex
is used on the digit or the skin between digits, which
is pinched to determine reflex response. A patient that
moves or withdraws the foot is in a light plane of anes-
thesia. The reflex weakens and disappears as the plane
deepens. Muscle tone is noted by the plane level and
is moderate when in a light plane and lessens as the 
plane level deepens.

dure. The incision is monitored for any signs of infection
or damage, which is noted within the medical record. Any
abnormal signs with the incision should be reported to the
Postoperative Patient Care
veterinarian for observation. If the incision is normal, the
sutures are cut individually with suture removal scissors
Postoperative care is completed after the patient has
recovered and continues until the patient is discharged.
This is the time frame when the patient is monitored for
pain, signs of infection, or hemorrhage. Once the inci-
sion is closed, the patient is disconnected from the an-
esthesia machine and the incision area is cleaned with
hydrogen peroxide. Do not wipe the incision itself, only
areas around the site. The area should be dried with a
tibiotics or pain medications that should be given to the
patient. The patient should be moved to the recovery
area. Some patients may require IV fluids, which should 
be placed on an IV pole or on an infusion pump. The
veterinary assistant should monitor the recovery phase
to make certain the patient's vital signs are normal and
the patient is comfortable.
Pain is sometimes difficult to assess and identify.
 Signs of pain may include the following:
 Restlessness
■ Whining or vocalization
 Reluctance to move

has a small hook shape on the end to better get under the
suture [see Figure 51-21]. The hook area is placed under
the suture and then cut. The assistant will then gently
pull each suture from the skin by holding and pulling at
the tie area. Staples are removed with a staple remover,
similar to what humans use in offices. The staple remover
is placed under the staple and squeezed to open up the
 staple, which is then gently removed from the site
Sterilization Techniques
The most common method for surgical sterilization
of packs and instruments is the autoclave (see
Figure 51-22]. It is not used on heat sensitive materials
that are made of plastic, rubber, or other materials that
may melt. Autoclaves come in a variety of shapes and
sizes. Distilled water is heated in the chamber to allow
high temperatures and pressures to produce the neces-
sary heat to sterilize items. The distilled water is sterile
Tap water should never be used as it will cause a mineral
buildup within the equipment and clog the heat source.
The higher the temperature, the quicker organisms

packs and then destroys any living organism. Materials
should not be packed into the autoclave too tightly as
this will prevent steam from entering all sites. Materi-
als are packed onto trays that sit within the autoclave
chamber. Once the packs are placed in the autoclave,
a lever or button is released to fill the interior cham-
ber, located below the trays, with the distilled water.
When the area is filled, the door is closed and should
be properly sealed. The heat source is turned on and
the temperature set. Temperature settings and times
will vary with equi pment. A chart of directions should be
located with the autoclave to note temperature and set-
tings for various materials. The preheat cycle begins and
is similar to an oven. Indicator lights will turn on and an
audible sound will be noted as the autoclave begins to
heat. The timer should be set. The entire cycle should
be allowed to function and observation may be required
especially if the device requires decreasing the tempera-
ture according to the type of machine. When the cycle
is complete, an alarm will sound. At this time, the ma-
chine should be turned off and the pressure allowed to
decrease. when the pressure has properly decreased,
the door can be partially opened to allow the steam to
air out. Caution must be taken as to not be burned by
the steam or the heat of the device. Never make direct
skin contact with the autoclave. The door should be left
partially ajar until the contents have cooled and dried.
When the items are ready to be removed, they should

Surgical Instruments
Veterinary assistants should be able to identify common
surgical tools, know how to clean and maintain the life
 of the instruments, and have an understanding of what
the instruments are used for and how they work.
Cleaning Surgical Instruments
Instruments must be cleaned after each surgical use
waste materials, and other debris that may build up on
instruments. Rust can occur on different types of metal
instruments if not properly cleaned, dried, or main-
tained. It is best to use special instrument cleaners and
distilled water to prevent deterioration of instruments

10 minutes and then be cleaned using a wire brush
and manual scrubbing. Chlorhexidine solution and
pink germicide are common instrument disinfectants.
Instruments can be hand cleaned and particular atten-
tion should be paid to the hinged areas and crevices.
Mechanical cleaning is another method for cleaning in-
struments. This is done by using an ultrasonic cleaner
[see Figure 51-24]. Instruments are placed within a
wire basket and the basket is seated within the cleaner,
which holds a disinfectant solution. The instruments

complete, the instruments are rinsed with dis-
tilled water. The instruments should be thoroughly
dried. They should then be dipped into a solution of

Hemostatic Forceps
Hemostatic forceps or hemostats are hinged locking
instruments that are designed to clamp and hold off
blood vessels [see Figure 51-35]. Hemostats may be
straight or curved. Mosquito hemostats are small in
size with a fine tip that is used to hold delicate blood
vessels [see Figure 51-36]. Kelly hemostats are larger
in size and are partially serrated to better hold and
grasp blood vessels (see Figure 51-37]. Crile hemo-
stats are similar in size and shape to Kelly forceps ex-
cept they are fully serrated. The serrations are located
within the interlocking jaws and are located verti-
cally along the blades. Carmalt hemostats are much
heavier and used to hold off the ovarian stump during
a spay surgery. The interlocking jaws are fully serrated

 Scissors are used to remove tissues during surgery. They
may have sharp ends that are pointed or blunt ends
that are rounded. They may also have straight or curved
blades. Mayo scissors are used to cut heavy tissues

Retractors
Retractors may be handheld or self-retracting and are
used during surgeries to hold open an animal's body
cavity for exploration. Senn and Holman retractors are
both handheld. Senn retractors have blades at each
end that look like fingers on the end of a hand. They

may be blunt or sharp in shape. Holman retractors are
levers that are flat with a pointed appearance that look
similar to an arrow (see Figure 51-39]. They have holes
in the handle and are commonly used during orthope-
dic procedures. Self-retracting retractors include the
Weitlaner and Gelpi retractors. The ends hold tissues
apart for better visualization within a body cavity. The
Weitaner retractor has rake-like teeth on the ratchet
ends and can be blunt or sharp [see Figure 51-40].
The Gelpi retractor has single points on the end that
are sharp.

The spay hook is used to locate the uterus and uterine
horns in small female animals. It is a long, thin, metal
device with a hook on the end (see Figure 51-41].
SuMMARY
Many aspects are involved with surgical assisting. Surgi-
cal preparation involves understanding care and main-
tenance of surgical equipment and instruments, patient
preparation and care, surgeon care and assistance, a
clean and aseptic surgical environment, and postopera-
tive care of the patient. The goal of all aspects within
the surgical suite is to maintain a sterile and aseptic en-
vironment that protects the patient and the veterinary
health care team.
