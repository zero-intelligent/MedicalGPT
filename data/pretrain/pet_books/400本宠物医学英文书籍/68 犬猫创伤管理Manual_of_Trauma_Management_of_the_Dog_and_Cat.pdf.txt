GLOBAL APPROACH TO THE TRAUMA PATIENT
Kenneth J. Drobatz
1.GLOBAL APPROACH TO THE TRAUMA PATIENT
a. Trauma is defined as a "wound or injury" and may occur secondary to motor vehicle accidents, fall from

mobilization and activation of neutrophils.
ili. Neutrophil release of lysosomal enzymes and toxic oxygen metabolites cause further cellular damage,
iv. Optimizing tissue oxygen delivery will minimize the perpetuation of these inflammation-producing
cascades.
3.ASSESSING AND MAINTAINING OXYGEN SATURATION OF HEMOGLOBIN-THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
assessment of an arterial blood gas or measurement of hemoglobin saturation confirms that oxygen
supplementation is not required:
supplementation is essential.
b. Physical assessment of the respiratory system (Figure 1.-1):

 causing upper airway sounds. Despite this problem, most animals do not suffer respiratory compromise
from these injuries.
3. Decreased air sounds on auscultation:
a. Indicates pleural space disease.
b. Traumatic causes of pleural space disease:
i. Pneumothorax (most common)
ii. Diaphragmatic hernia
ili. Severe hemothorax (least common)
c. Thoracocentesis:
i. If the patient is in respiratory distress and you cannot hear the lung sounds well, then thoracocentesis is
warranted.
4. Increased lung sounds on auscultation (not the upper airway sounds referred to earlier):
a. Indicate lower airway/pulmonary parenchymal injury:
i. Pulmonary contusions:
1. Therapy for pulmonary contusions is largely supportive with caution on overzealous fluid therapy.
5. Open chest wound/"sucking" chest wound:
a. Open wounds connecting to the pleural space should be immediately covered with a sterile bandage,
which will create a seal, and thoracocentesis should then be performed to remove the residual air.
b. If respiratory distress persists, intubation and positive pressure ventilation should be provided until the
wounds can be surgically repaired.
6. Flail chest:
a. Recognized by paradoxic movement of the chest wall. The flail segment moves in on inspiration and is
place.
b. Primary physiologic consequences are pain and underlying lung damage and pleural space injury in
most instances.
4.ASSESSING CARDIAC OUTPUT/TISSUE PERFUSION
a. Initial assessment of adequate cardiac output and circulating volume includes mucous membrane color,
capillary refill time, pulse rate, and quality:
i. Abnormalities indicating poor tissue perfusion
1. Pale or gray mucous membranes
2. Prolonged capillary refill time (>1-2 seconds)
3. Weak and rapid pulses
 b. Measurement of arterial blood pressure directly or indirectly by Doppler or oscillometric techniques should
be performed when possible:
i. A Doppler systolic blood pressure of <80 is suggestive of decreased tissue perfusion.
ii. A mean arterial pressure of <60 mm Hg is suggestive of decreased tissue perfusion.
ili. It should be kept in mind that blood pressure may be normal or even high and peripheral tissue

d. The most common cause of poor tissue perfusion in the trauma patient is hypovolemia from blood loss:
retroperitoneal and peritoneal spaces).
e. The less common causes of poor tissue perfusion are cardiac arrhythmias, tension pneumothorax,
hemopericardium from traumatic atrial rupture.
f. Therapy of poor tissue perfusion:
i. Thoracocentesis if a tension pneumothorax is present (this is extremely rare).
 lil. Intrave nous fluids/colloids/blood products/hemoglobin substitutes:
1. Caution with fluids when pulmonary contusions are present.

b. Conclusions regarding brain and neurologic function (brain and spinal cord) should be withheld until
perfusion is adequate and function is reassessed:
perfusion is improved.
c. Assessment of brain function:
i. Mentation:
1. Grades of mentation:
a. Excited/agitated
b. Normal
c. Depressed
d. Obtunded (markedly decreased level of consciousness, but arousable with auditory or tactile
stimulation)
e. Stupor (unconscious but responds to noxious stimuli)
f. Coma (unconscious and does not respond to noxious stimuli)
2. Cranial nerve assessment:
a. Assessment of facial sensation, jaw tone (be careful with jaw fractures), eye position and movement,
3. Evidence of potential brain injury:
a. Obvious head trauma (skull fractures, bleeding from ear, jaw fractures, scleral, or ocular hemorrhage,
etc.)
b. Altered mentation
c. Altered cranial nerve function
4. General principles of treating brain injury:
a. Primary injury (direct trauma to tissues)- no specific treatment for this.
b. Secondary injury (swelling, inflammation, reperfusion injury, increased intracranial pressure):
i. Maintain good perfusion/blood pressure (MAP at least 80 mm Hg, systolic at least 90 mm Hg).
 ii. Maintain good oxygenation via oxygen supplementation, ventilation, etc. (PaOz > 80 mm Hg, SpOz >
95%).
ii. Hyperosmotics:
1. Mannitol
2. Hypertonic saline/colloid combination to treat decreased blood pressure and poor tissue perfusion
iv. Elevate head 30? from horizontal if increased intracranial pressure is suspected.
d. Assessing spinal cord function:
i. Ensure that tissue perfusion is adequate.
iil. Palpate full length of the spine and pelvis.
ili. Note the voluntary movement of all legs.
iv. Assess the ability to stand/ambulate.
v. Check anal tone and anal reflex.
vi. Check proprioception of limbs.
vii. Assess lirmb reflexes.
vili. Evidence of spinal cord injury:
1. Spinal or sacral fractures/displacement
2. Spinal pain
3. Changes in limb function or sensation.
4. Change in tail tone, bladder, or anal sphincter function
ix. General principles of treating spinal cord injury:
 1. Stabilization of fractures/luxations
 2. Decompression surgery (e.g., hemilaminectomy for ruptured intervertebral disk)
3. Corticosteroids (controversial)

or injury.
d. Hematuria indicates urinary tract injury.
e. Manifestations of renal damage may not be immediately evident at presentation and may not be detected
until several hours later, after continuous monitoring.
 f. Potential trauma-induced urinary tract injuries:
i. Kidney contusions, rupture, or avulsion
 li. Renal pelvis disruption
ili. Urethral disruption
 iv. Urinary bladder rupture
v. Urethral trauma/rupture
 g. General therapy for urinary tract trauma:
i. IV fluid diuresis
ii. Stabilization of cardiovascular manifestations of urinary tract injury (hyperkalemia)
ill. Surgical repair and/or urinary diversion of injuries if necessary
7.SECONDARY SURVEY
a. Full physical examination.
b. Particular attention should be paid to the following:
i. Musculoskeletal system:
1. Obse rve limb function of all four legs.
2. Observe ambulation.
3. Complete palpation of appendicular and axial skeleton including rectal examination, palpation of skull,
 and manipulation of jaw.
ii.Peripheral nervous system:
Full evaluation of peripheral nerves.
ili. Examine the animal from the tip of the nose to the tip of the tail.

b. Triage history:
i. Presenting Complaint (PC) is simply the reason for presentation.
ii. Last Normal (LN) refers to when the patient was last normal. In the trauma setting, this will include the
date and time of the trauma.
ill. Full medical historical examination is critical, but will be performed at a later time once the primary
survey is complete and initial stabilization is underway.
c. Triage technique:
i. The "physical examination" aspects of triage are focused on assessment of the ABCs and on cursory
evaluation of the major body systems.
lf. ABCs:
1. A: Does the patient have a patent airway?
2. B: Is the patient breathing?
3. C: Does the patient have spontaneous circulation?
4. A "no" answer to any of these questions will prompt immediate movement of the patient to the
system:
 1. Cardiovascular system:
a. The status of the cardiovascular system can be assessed in less than 20 seconds through examination

i. Mucous membrane color
ii. Capillary refill time (CRT)
ili. Pulse rate
iv. Pulse quality
b. Mucous membrane color:

ii. Pale mucous membranes result from anemia or peripheral vasoconstriction induced by hypovolemia,

to the treatment area for assessment for evidence of hypovolemia, hypoxemia, and the management of
pain.
vi. Bradycardia is relatively uncommon in the traumatized patient:
1. The patient that has sustained head trauma may demonstrate overt or relative bradycardia due to
increased intracranial pressure.
2. The patient that has uroperitoneum may demonstrate overt or relative bradycardia associated with
hyperkalemia.
3. Blunt cardiac injury is a very rare cause of bradycardia.
4. Bradycardia should prompt movement of the patient to the treatment area for further assessment.
traumatized dog or cat:
i. The femoral pulse should be assessed in the dog and cat and the dorsal pedal pulse can often be

due to hypovolemia (decreased preload) is the most common cause of poor pulse quality:
1. Inability to feel the pulse at the dorsal metatarsal region in the dog could imply compromise to the
2. Inability to palpate the pulse of a dog or cat at the femoral artery implies life threatening
ili. Pulse quality is very subjective and is something that many individuals have developed a variety of
different adjectives to describe:
1. Pulse quality should be assessed as normal, weaker than normal, or stronger than normal.
2. In the traumatized patient, weaker than normal pulses may occur in response to conditions including

2. Respiratory system:
a. The status of the respiratory system can be determined in less than 20 seconds through assessment of
the following
i. Respiratory rate
ii. Respiratory effort
b. A commonly overlooked technique for assessing the respiratory system is simply to "take a step back"
 and observe the patient (hands of) for 10 seconds (respiratory rate can be taken at this time as well)
c. Respiratory rate:
i. Assessment of the respiratory rate provides an excellent assessment of the overall status of the

iv. A restricted breathing pattern characterized by frequent short breaths of small tidal volume is
common in animals with pleural space disease after trauma (pneumothorax, pleural effusion, and
further evaluation and oxygen therapy.
v. Stridorous breathing may be observed in upper airway obstruction:
1. Inspiratory stridor generally implies dynamic obstruction of the extrathoracic airway.

3. During inspiration, animals with PAM will demonstrate outward movement of the thoracic wall and
inward movement of the abdomen.
4. In the traumatized patient, PAM implies diaphragmatic disease or dysfunction most often associated
with diaphragmatic hernia. Less frequently, airway obstruction or severe decreases in pulmonary
compliance associated with massive pulmonary contusion may also cause PAM in the traumatized
and oxygen therapy.
vii. Upon movement to the treatment area due to suspicion of respiratory compromise, further
including thoracocentesis may be necessary if pneumothorax or hemothorax is suspected.
3. Central nervous system:
a. A simple assessment of the patient's level of consciousness and the historical question of whether or
not the patient was able to walk are appropriate for the triage assessment of the central nervous system.
b. Altered levels of consciousness include obtunded, stuporous, and comatose (see Chapter 7: Traumatic

d. Any dog or cat that has sustained trauma, that does not have a history of normal ambulation after
trauma, should be treated as if a spinal injury is present. Immobilization should be accomplished
immediately.
e. Upon movement to the treatment area due to suspicion of CNs compromise, further assessment
should focus on a full physical and neurologic examinations, modified Glasgow coma scoring, and

4.PRIMARY SURVEY
a. Definition and philosophy:
the primary survey is to perform a more in-depth assessment of those major body systems.

the primary survey.
b. Primary survey technique:

can be appropriately applied in veterinary medicine as well:
1. Airway: The veterinarian should assess for the presence of a patent airway. If the airway is not patent

instituted at 10-15 breaths per minute utilizing 100% oxygen. Caution should be exercised during
intubation of the traumatized patient to minimize movement of the cervical spine and thus prevent
exacerbation of injury secondary to spinal trauma
respiratory system should be performed:
a. Respiratory rate (see 3.c.li.2.)
b. Respiratory effort (see 3.c.ili.2.)
include, but are not limited to, bruising, full thickness skin wounds, subcutaneous emphysema,
subcutaneous fluid accumulation, displacement of a rib/ribs, sternal irregularities, and paradoxical
movement of a floating thoracic segment (flail chest).
d. Auscultation of the chest should be performed to evaluate for pulmonary parenchymal or pleural
space injuries:
i. Pleural space injuries (pneumothorax, hemothorax, chylothorax, and diaphragmatic hernia) cause
decreased lung sounds.

Chapter 6: Trauma-Associated Thoracic Injury.
results may include the following:
pleural fluid accumulations after trauma.
ii. Indicators of oxygenation: Determination of oxygen saturation (SpOz) or arterial blood gas analysis wil
help dictate the need for oxygen support. Oxygen should be administered to all patients with increased
respiratory rate and effort and/or SpOz<94%. Hypoxemia in the traumatized dog or cat signifies injury to
the respiratory system.
ili. Thoracic radiographs may be performed after cardiovascular and respiratory system stabilization is
underway. Thoracic radiographs will allow for confirmation of injuries suspected based on primary survey
of the respiratory system.
f.  Initial therapy for respiratory system injuries based on primary survey results may include the
following:
i. Oxygen support is uniformly administered to all patients who have sustained trauma that has any
evidence of injury associated with the respiratory (or cardiovascular) systems:
1. High (100%) concentrations of oxygen delivered over short periods of time (<24 hours) will not cause
harm.
oxygen concentration that can be achieved, and contact with the patient. These methods are:
a. Nasal insufflation:
i. Achieved by placement of a soft red rubber catheter or other cannula into the nose. Before placement,
2-5 drops of lidocaine should be placed in the nostril(s) every 5 minutes for three doses. 5F is appropriate
for use in cats and very small dogs. 8F is appropriate in dogs of most sizes. A measurement is taken from
cannula is marked. The well-lubricated cannula is then advanced in a ventral and medial direction to the
predetermined mark. The cannula is then secured in place just adjacent to the alar fold of the nose

added to this distance and the cannula is marked. After local anesthetic administration, the cannula will be
advanced to this mark and sutured in place.
ii. Moderate to high FiOz is achieved with this method. FiOz = 0.5 (50%) may be achieved in normal dogs
ili. Method is inexpensive.
iv. Moderately stressful to place.
v. Excellent for longer term oxygen support in dogs.
vi. Should be utilized in conjunction with a humidification system to minimize airway irritation/damage.

d. Mask oxygen:
i. Achieved by simply placing a mask over the nose/face of the patient.
ii. Can achieve high FiOz.

ii. Can achieve high FiOz.
ili. Cats tolerate vented baggie method well (short term).
iv. Inexpensive.
f. Endotracheal intubation:
i. Allows for the delivery of 100% oxygen (FiOz = 1.0) as well as positive pressure ventilation.
ii. Allows for control of airway in upper airway obstruction.
ii. Minimizes stress because the patient is anesthetized.
iv. Inexpensive.
v. Disadvantages include the need for general anesthesia and intensive monitoring of the anesthetized
patient.
ii. Thoracocentesis may be rapidly performed if pneumothorax or pleural effusion is suspected; see
Chapter 6: Trauma-Associated Thoracic Injury.
3. Circulation: The veterinarian should assess for the presence of spontaneous circulation and a ful
a. Mucous membranes (see 3.c.li.1)
b. CRT (see 3.c.l.1)
c. Pulse rate (see 3.c.ili.1)
d. Pulse character (see 3.c.ili.1)
e. Evaluate for hemorrhage:
 i. Five sites for large volume blood loss after trauma:
1. Peritoneal space
 2. Retroperitoneal space
3. Pleural space
4. Externally
5. Around proximal long-bone fractures (primarily femur)
i. Arrhythmia:
1. Arrhythmias are relatively uncommon in the acutely traumatized patient and more commonly manifest
following:
a. Hypoxemia
b. Myocardial contusion
c. Ischemia-reperfusion injury
 2. Underlying cardiac disease such as dilated cardiomyopathy may result in arrhythmias that are detected
incidentally during primary survey of the trauma patient. The presence of underlying cardiac disease may
influence initial fluid therapy decisions toward a more conservative resuscitation protocol.
ii. Heart murmur:
aans aeud uo paiaiap inunu peau e jo auasaid aun u lnsan aeu aseasip reipue uapun 
2. Presence of a heart murmur may influence initial fluid therapy decisions toward a more conservative
resuscitation protocol.
ii. Decreased heart sounds:
1. Decreased heart sounds may be noted on initial auscultation of the heart during the primary survey.
2. Pleural space diseases (pneumothorax, pleural effusion, and diaphragmatic hernia) and pericardial
effusion may result in decreased heart sounds due to the presence of fluid surrounding the heart.
g. Assessment of the jugular vein should be performed:
i. The jugular furrow is clipped free of hair for evaluation.
 ii. The jugular vein may be difficult to palpate and may not distend rapidly when transiently occluded in
 hypovolemic states. The jugular vein should not be transiently occluded in the patient with head trauma.
ili. Jugular venous distention may be noted in animals with pericardial effusion, massive hemorrhage into
the mediastinum,or massive air accumulations in the mediastinum.
h. Initial diagnostic testing for further evaluation of cardiovascular system injury based on primary survey
results are directed primarily toward the identification of sources of hemorrhage:
i. Focused assessment with sonography for trauma, or the FAST scan, of the abdomen to evaluate for

5. Blood type:
a. Determination of DEA 1.1 status is useful in directing whole blood or packed red blood cell transfusions
to traumatized patients:

metabolism can be sustained:
2. Aerobic metabolism is an efficient way to maintain ATP production and, therefore, cell membrane
 pump function and cellular integrity.
b. Shock occurs when tissue oxygen delivery is insufficient to meet the metabolic requirement for oxygen
delivery at the tissue level (Figure 3.-1):
i. Aerobic metabolism can no longer be sustained when this occurs.
ii. In this scenario, anaerobic metabolism ensues, with 1 mole of glucose yielding only 2 moles of ATP,
which are rapidly consumed.
ili. Anaerobic metabolism is an inefficient means of ATP production and leads to generation of a lactic
acidosis.
iv. Left uncorrected, a tissue oxygen debt develops, cells and organs become hypoxemic, and cellular
 and/or end-organ damage occurs, which can ultimately result in cell death and organ failure.
c. Compensatory responses to shock:
i. When tissue oxygen delivery is decreased, the body initially mounts a compensatory response in order to
maintain tissue oxygen delivery at an acceptable level to maintain aerobic metabolism.

2.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION OF THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM
a. Auscultation of the heart:
i. Heart rate and rhythm should be evaluated on initial assessment of the traumatized patient prior to fluid
stabilization):
1. The normal heart rate for a dog varies according to its size. For large or giant breeds of dog, a heart
rate ranging from 60 to 100 beats/min should be considered normal. For small to medium breeds of dog,
a heart rate ranging from 100 to 140 beats/min should be considered normal. Heart rates in excess of 100
2. The normal heart rate for a cat in the hospital is usually 160-220 beats/min. Heart rates higher and
in critically ill cats and should not be ignored. Two of the most common causes of bradycardia in the
traumatized cat include hyperkalemia and hypothermia.
ii. The heart should be carefully auscultated for the presence of a murmur or gallop. while murmurs or
 detection of a murmur or gallop provides information about the possibility of underlying cardiac disease
 and the likelihood that the animal will tolerate intravenous fluid therapy:

Patient).
ili. The ability to hear the heart adequately should be assessed. Inability to adequately auscultate the heart
may indicate severe hypovolemia, pericardial effusion or pleural space disease.
b. Assessment of peripheral pulses:
i. Palpation of peripheral pulses should be performed routinely in all traumatized patients. Pulse palpation
can give information about heart rate, regularity of heart rhythm, and perfusion status.
ii. Pulse quality:

3. Pulse quality is determined by the pulse pressure, which is the difference between the systolic and
diastolic pressures. This difference can be altered by changes in stroke volume, vasomotor tone, and
diastolic runoff of blood.
c. Assessment of mucous membranes:
aun 'iewjue lewou e ul au lau aeden pue holon soy passasse ag pinous sauegwau snonnn '!
 mucous membranes should be pink and moist with a capillary refill time of 1-2 seconds.

3.REASONS FOR CRCULATORY COMPROMISE AND SHOCKIN THE TRAUMATIZED PATIENT
a. Hypovolemic shock:
i. Acute blood loss:
1. The blood volume in dogs is approximately 90 mL/kg, while in cats it is approximately 66 ml/kg.
equivalent to an acute blood loss of 30 ml/kg in a dog and 22 ml/kg in cat:
a. Mild hemorrhage (15-30%): The presence of tachycardia may be the only clinical sign present in the
therefore, mucous membrane color, capillary refill time, and pulse quality will still be assessed as normal.
b. Moderate hemorrhage (30-40%): Impaired peripheral tissue perfusion develops at this point. Pale
mucous membranes, delayed capillary refill time, weak peripheral pulses, and cold extremities may be
aun 'uoisnad anss paiedul andsp pauieiuieu aa ls Aeu aunssaid poola aseis siun ne paiou
output will decrease once 30-40% of blood volume is lost.
c. Severe/life-threatening hemorrhage (>40%): Marked signs of circulatory collapse are present. At this
point, not only is tissue perfusion impaired but attempts to maintain blood pressure fail and marked
hypotension results.
3. Areas where a significant amount of blood can be lost following trauma that results in cardiovascular
compromise:

b. Abdominal cavity—the abdominal cavity is probably the most common site for significant blood loss in

iv. Radiographically, there will be loss of retroperitoneal detail obscuring the ability to visualize the
kidneys, the presence of a "wispy” pattern in the retroperitoneal space, and possibly ventral deviation of
the colon on a lateral radiograph (Figure 3.-3).

animals never make it to a veterinarian before the animal arrests. Most hemothoraces are of a small
volume and clinically insignificant.

of blood lost into those regions would be insufficient to cause cardiovascular compromise.
ii. Third-spacing of fluids:
1. Third-spacing is seen most often in traumatized patients with chemical peritonitis, such as occurs with
urinary bladder rupture or bile peritonitis.
2. The irritant (urine, bile) within the peritoneal cavity induces an inflammatory response that causes
vascular leak, which can result in hypovolemia.
3. In addition to vascular leak, this inflammatory response often results in a vasodilatory state (see the
following).
ili. Decreased intake of fluids:
1. Animals who have sustained trauma resulting in an altered state of consciousness (i.e., head trauma)
or an altered ability to access free water will eventually become dehydrated and potentially hypovolemic
(when dehydration is marked, i.e., 10-15%) unless parenteral fluid therapy is provided.
2.  This would likely take days beyond the traumatic incident to become evident, unless other
confounding factors, such as blood loss, third-spacing, or mannitol administration, are concurrently
present.
b. Cardiogenic shock:
i. Direct myocardial trauma:
1. Cardiac trauma can occur secondary to blunt or penetrating trauma.
 2. Mechanisms of cardiac injury include acceleration-deceleration forces which result in compression of
heart, rapid transfer of kinetic injury from direct trauma to the thorax, direct cardiac trauma (more often
anssad leuiuongeeun sopue peeouieui ul saseaoun pide ao (ewnen lueauad go insa e se
leading to increased venous return and overdistention of the ventricle, causing bruising or rupture.
myocardial function.
which likely increases myocardial workload and oxygen demand.
6. Atrial rupture/tearing is uncommon, but has been reported in dogs following trauma. The resulting
hemorrhagic pericardial effusion can lead to shock. This is not because of the volume of blood lost;
reduces cardiac output.
ii. Indirect myocardial injury:
ill. Pericardial effusion:
1. Atrial rupture/tearing is uncommon, but has been reported in dogs following blunt and penetrating
thoracic trauma
2. The resulting hemorrhagic pericardial effusion can lead to shock.
 3. This is not because of the volume of blood lost; instead, it is because the pericardial effusion reduces
venous return (preload) to the heart and therefore reduces cardiac output.
iv. Thoracic tamponade:
1. Definition: Decreased cardiac output as a result of impaired venous return to the heart as a result of
increased intrathoracic pressure.
2. Causes:
a. Tension pneumothorax (see Chapter 6: Trauma-Associated Thoracic Injury)
by removal of the abdominal contents from the thorax, when a diaphragmatic hernia is present:
a. When the stomach has herniated into the thoracic cavity, it can become distended with gas and result
in a vicious cycle of respiratory distress, which causes more gas to accumulate in the stomach secondary
c. Vasodilatory shock:
i. Vasodilatory shock refers most commonly to inflammatory disease states that are characterized by a lack
of arterial vascular tone and maldistribution of blood flow, often resulting initially in a high cardiac output
function.
ii. The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SiRS) is a term used to characterize those patients that
within the body but has resulted in a diffuse inflammatory state throughout the body:
a. Sepsis refers to a patient who meets the SIRS criteria AND an infectious agent (bacterial, viral,
protozoal, or fungal) has been identified. Of these, bacterial infections are most likely following trauma:
il. Overwhelming bacterial infections may occur secondary to bite wounds, degloving wounds, other
cutaneous injuries, or even as a result of improper bandage management.
b. Sterile inflammation:
i. Chemical peritonitis—rupture of the urinary bladder or gall bladder releases urine or bile, respectively,
which can induce an intense inflammatory response in the peritoneal cavity. Most cases of chemical
 peritonitis are sterile.
ii. Traumatic pancreatitis can occur as a result of blunt force trauma to the abdomen or as a result of
decreased pancreatic perfusion following injury.
il. Massive tissue trauma as a result of blunt or penetrating trauma can induce a marked inflammatory

inflammation, leading to a vasodilatory state following resuscitation.
4.CLINICAL SIGNS OF CARDIOVASCULAR COMPROMISE
a. Hypovolemic shock:
i. Pale mucous membranes: pallor to the mucous membranes is a normal compensatory response to
organs.
Jo hnsa e se pasuolod sawonag la Aeden aui :(spuosas s't<) au llau Aedeo pasuoloid "!!
ii. Weak to absent peripheral pulse quality: Peripheral pulse quality is often diminished as a result of
peripheral vasoconstriction and shunting of blood to vital organs. Cool to cold extremities are often noted

iv. Tachycardia: Since cardiac output is equal to Heart Rate x Stroke Volume, a compensatory increase in

 result in decreased mentation. Mentation should always be reassessed following resuscitation.
viil. Decreased urine output: Urine output decreases as a normal compensatory response to hypovolemia
in order to retain fluid and expand intravascular volume. These animals should have concentrated urine in
the face of hypovolemia so long as adequate renal function is present. With severe and prolonged
hypovolemia, decreased urine output may occur as a result of decreased renal blood flow and secondary
acute tubular injury.

herniation of abdominal organs into the chest or pericardium, may be characterized by quiet heart and
lungs sounds (unilaterally or bilaterally), a distended or "sprung" thorax, and/or a restrictive respiratory
pattern (short, shallow breathing). Animals with diaphragmatic hernia may demonstrate a paradoxica
abdominal movement during respiration, wherein the abdomen expands on expiration and collapses
during inspiration.
c.Vasodilatory shock:
i. Suggested criteria to characterize SiRs (must meet two of four criteria to classify as SiRS):
<100*F, and/or white blood cell count >12,000 or <4000 (Hauptman et al., 1997; 0kan0 et al., 2002).

b. Profound hypoperfusion can markedly elevate PCOz concentrations in peripheral venous blood
samples, exacerbating the extent of acidosis in the sample:
i. The elevated PcOz should not be confused with hypoventilation. Instead, the increased PCOz
represents decreased local tissue perfusion and accumulation of cOz which is not being picked up by the
venous circulation and returned to the lungs for excretion.
ii. Arterial blood gas sampling will more accurately reflect the patient's ventilatory status in this scenario.
Arterial:
a. Arterial blood gas sampling should be used to obtain information about ventilation and oxygenation.
lll. Lactate:
1. Lactate concentrations can be measured by several commercial blood gas analyzers (Critical Care
Xpress, Nova Biomedical, Waltham, MA; iStat, Abbott Point of Care, East Windsor, NJ) or independently
2. Blood samples should be processed within 5 minutes of collection to minimize artificial elevations in
lactate conce ntrations.
 3. Normal lactate concentrations should be less than 2.0 mmol/L in cats and dogs.
4. Elevations in lactate often correlate to the severity of hypoperfusion and subsequent decrease in
oxygen delivery:
a. Mild hypoperfusion: lactate concentrations between 3 and 5 mmol/L:

hypoperfused muscle cells.
3. Decreased total protein, albumin, and globulin are seen primarily with hemorrhage, but can also be
 seen with inflammatory disease states causing increased vascular permeability and with severe cutaneous
wounds and burns where proteins exude from the surfaces. In the latter two conditions, albumin may
decrease more so than globulin, as globulins are larger molecules making them less likely to leak in states

c. Electrocardiogram (ECG):
i. A lead-ll ECG should be used in the resuscitation phase following trauma. It is valuable for the following
reasons:
diseases resulting in atrial enlargement.
2. To diagnose and monitor dysrhythmias associated with trauma, such as ventricular tachycardia or
often noted within the first 24 hours following a traumatic injury.
ii. Probably the most effective use of ECG monitoring in the trauma patient is to noninvasively monitor the
patient's response to resuscitation efforts or other therapies, by allowing continuous assessment of the
 animal's heart rate.
d.Focused Assessment with 5onography for Trauma (FAST Ultrasound) (Figure 3.-5):
i. The FAST ultrasound examination is designed as a diagnostic tool to allow veterinarians with minimal
ultrasonographic training to rapidly assess for free fluid in the chest and abdomen in traumatized patients:

2. Entire examination should take less than 5 minutes.
3. Purpose of the examination is to look for the presence or absence of free fluid and not to look for other
underlyingpathology.
ii. The patient should be restrained in lateral recumbency for the examination.
ili. There are four different sites that should be evaluated during the FAST examination:
1. Ventral midline subxiphoid: this site is evaluated for fluid accumulation between liver lobes and the
diaphragm, in the pleural and pericardial spaces.

evaluated for fluid accumulation in the peritoneal space (between bowel loops, spleen, and liver) and 
retroperitoneal space around the kidney.
 3. Ventral midline prepubic: this site is evaluated for for fluid accumulation around the urinary bladder
and pelvis.
4. Each site should be evaluated with two views: a transverse view and a longitudinal view, which can be
obtained by rotating the ultrasound transducer 90°.
iv. Accuracy: The FAST is a highly sensitive test to determine if free fluid has accumulated in the abdomen

hemorrhage, urine, bilious effusion, etc.) (Boysen et al., 2004)
e. Urine output (see Chapter 4: Monitoring of the Trauma Patient):
i. Urine output in a euvolemic animal with normal renal function should be approximately 0.5-1.0
mL/kg/h. One should always take into account the volume of fluid being administered when considering
normal urine output. For instance, if an animal is volume expanded, well hydrated, and has no other losses
(i.e. diarrhea, third-spacing) urine output should be only slightly lower than fluid input.

serves to conserve water and attempt to correct deficits in circulatory volume:
and the need to administer additional fluids to replace fluid deficits.
ili. In the presence of hypotension, or inadequate renal perfusion, the urine output will decrease to an
oliguric state. Mean arterial blood pressures below 80 mm Hg can affect urine output. This occurs not only
stimulation of a variety of neurohormonal chemicals which act to conserve volume. Restoration of renal
perfusion often restores urine output.
iv. Urine output can be measured noninvasively by free catching all urine and by using absorbent cage
pads which can be weighed (1 ml = 1 gram) or by placement of an indwelling urinary catheter and
connection to a closed collection system.
f. Thoracic radiographs:
i. while not recommended as an initial diagnostic in the cardiovascularly unstable trauma patient, thoracic
radiographs can provide useful information in these patients:
1. The cardiac silhouette and size of the caudal vena cava can be assessed for degree of volume
expansion (Figure 3.-6).
FLGURE3.-6

microcardia (the heart spans only 2 rib spaces) and the caudal vena cava is thin as a result of hypovolemia.
2. Thoracic radiographs may help in the evaluation of preexisting cardio-respiratory disease.
3. Detection of interstitial to alveolar infiltrates may indicate pulmonary contusions secondary to trauma.
Pulmonary contusions can result in variable degrees of hypoxemia, which may explain some signs of
cardiovascular compromise.
4. Detection of a pneumothorax or diaphragmatic hernia, which may have gone undiagnosed based upon
physical examination, may help to explain ongoing cardiovascular compromise.

lii. Catheter location:
1. When vascular access is needed in the traumatized patient, the initial catheter should be placed at a
site that is easily accessed with minimal stress to the patient and is familiar to the person placing the
catheter. Most often, this is a peripheral catheter placed in the cephalic or lateral saphenous vein:
injuries, or limbs with known or suspected vascular disruption proximal to the catheter site.
b. Alternative sites for peripheral vascular access include the medial saphenous vein (more frequently
used in cats), the accessory cephalic vein distal to the carpus, and the auricular veins that run along the
ear margins.

collapse.
b. Jugular venous catheterization will not only facilitate placement of a larger bore catheter, but also
fluids enter.
Some animals will have depressed mentation as a result of cardiovascular collapse and therefore will
allow this procedure with minimal to no distress. However, if placement of a catheter at this site causes
distress, one or two peripheral venous catheters should be placed depending upon the size of the patient
fortheTrauma Patient).

should be checked for the ability to retrieve a blood sample, and then all ports should be flushed with sterile
heparinized saline, being careful not to flush air into the jugular vein. The catheter can then be sutured in place

ii. Once the wire is passed distally, the needle or catheter can be removed, leaving only the wire in the

ili. A vessel dilator is passed over the wire to facilitate placement of a larger catheter. The dilator is then
removed, again leaving only the wire.
e. If there is a concern for intracranial trauma, the jugular vein should not be used for catheterization, as
even transient compression of the jugular vein can markedly increase intracranial pressure and result in
patient deterioration (see Chapter 7: Traumatic Brain Injury).
f. In addition, if there is concern for a coagulopathy (either hypo- or hypercoagulability), jugular
venipuncture should be avoided.
ii. Catheterization techniques:
1. Percutaneous catheterization: most commonly used when peripheral vessels are readily visible or
blood is noted in the catheter hub, the entire catheter and stylet should be advanced together another
1-2 mm, then the catheter fed off the stylet into the vessel.
is used to make a small knick (i.e., 2-4 mm) in the skin overlying the site of catheterization allowing for
aforementioned method. This approach is recommended for jugular catheterization due to the thicker
nature of the skin in this area.
3. Venous cut down: this method can be used over either a peripheral vein or the jugular vein when
hypoperfusion or swelling impairs the ability to adequately visualize or palpate the vessel:
a. When time allows, strict aseptic procedure (clipping, skin preparation, and sterile gloves) should be
used.
b. If aseptic technique cannot be used during the cut down for catheterization, the catheter should be
used for the minimal amount of time necessary, at most 24 hours, until vascular access elsewhere can be
obtained. Prophylactic antibiotics (cefazolin 22 mg/kg IV Q8 hours) should be administered in this
wound and surgically closed when the animal is more stable.
c. Peripheral:
i. The saphenous or cephalic veins are preferred for this procedure as they are larger and readily
accessible.

proximal and distal portion of the vein and used as stay sutures to occlude venous flow then tied off once
the catheter is in place.
d. Jugular:
i. The patient should be placed in lateral recumbency with the head and neck extended.
ii. The jugular vein should be occluded at the thoracic inlet. The skin should be incised just lateral to the

to expose the jugular vein. Placement of the catheter percutaneously and then into the cut-down site and
into the vessel will create a subcutaneous tunnel that may make the catheter less prone to infection
rather than placing it directly through the cut-down site.
iv. Proceed as directed above for the peripheral cut-down.

c. The subcutaneous route is not acceptable for fluid administration to animals with signs of shock:
i. With hypovolemia, the peripheral vascular beds are vasoconstricted
the intravascular space. Most animals have normal hydration status following trauma.
8.FLUID THERAPY FOR SHOCK
a. The main goal of fluid therapy in animals with shock is to restore adequate circulation without causing
excessive harm to the patient-this is a delicate balance. Overly aggressive fluid administration could
potentially exacerbate the risk for hemorrhage in a bleeding animal as a result of improved blood flow to the
perfusion pressure. Fluids should be used cautiously in the patient with thoracic trauma and pulmonary
contusions, as aggressive fluid resuscitation may exacerbate pulmonary dysfunction.
b. There is no evidence in the literature to support that one fluid resuscitation regimen {i.e., isotonic
crystalloids) is any better or worse than another (i.e., colloids). what is most important is resuscitation of the
patient such that delivery of oxygen to the tissues is restored.
c. Options for fluid therapy:
i. Crystalloids:
1. Isotonic:
resuscitation of the traumatized patient.
b. Examples of isotonic crystalloids include 0.9% NaCl and balanced electrolyte solutions such as
Normosol-Re, Plasmalyte*, Lactated Ringer's, and Ringer's Acetate.

1 hour after infusion. Because of this redistribution, the recommended volume for resuscitation with
isotonic crystalloids is 3 times the volume lost.
d. The shock dose of isotonic crystalloid solutions is 90 mL/kg in the dog and 66 mg/kg in the cat. This is

reassessment of the patient for restoration of circulation.
il. Typically the entire shock dose is calculated (i.e., 1800 mL for a 20-kg dog) and a portion of that fluid
will be given rapidly (i.e., 600 ml over 10-15 minutes), then the patient is reassessed for adequacy of
resuscitation.
peripheral limb temperature.
e. Only 1/4-1/3 of the volume infused remains in the intravascular space after one hour because of
10-15 minutes for the first hour following their shock bolus of isotonic crystalloid, to ensure maintenance
of adequate resuscitation.
2. Hypertonic:
a. Hypertonic saline solutions (HSS) are an affordable resuscitation fuid which may be beneficial in the
i.Hss are most commonly used at a 7.0-7.8% concentration. This fluid may be given alone or in
combination with an artificial colloid.
ii.  Extremely concentrated formulations of hypertonic saline are commercially available-one common
formulation is available at a 23.4% concentration (Hospira, Inc., Lake Forest, IL). Note: This solution
irritation and red blood cell hemolysis.
ili. Despite its hypertonicity, HSS is still a crystalloid fluid. Therefore, following intravascular volume
expansion, it will redistribute to the entire extracellular space (interstitial + intravascular compartments)
and at most 1/3 of the total volume expansion remains intravascular after 1 hour.
and duration of volume expansion obtained from the combination of these two fluids exceeds that which
could be obtained by either fluid alone.
v. The duration of volume expansion has been shown to increase 30 minutes when HsS is used alone to 3
hours when combined with an artificial colloid in dogs. The duration of volume expansion is similar
vi. However, dextran-70 has been shown to promote a larger degree of volume expansion in combination
with HsS compared to an equivalent volume of hetastarch. This is because the degree of volume
expansion obtained with an artificial colloid is related to the number of molecules rather than the size of
the particles present in the solution.
b. HSS are insufficient for maintenance requirements (2-3 mL/kg/h) or to replace ongoing losses
Therefore, isotonic crystalloid solutions, at rates suitable to account for those needs, are mandatory
following initial shock doses of HSS
c. Purported benefits of hypertonic saline resuscitation:
i. Lower infusion volumes required for resuscitation compared to isotonic crystalloids and artificial
colloids—this facilitates more rapid resuscitation:
1. Experimental studies in dogs demonstrate that the volume of Hss needed for resuscitation in
hemorrhagic shock was only 10% of shed blood volume, compared to 3 times the shed blood volume
needed with isotonic crystalloids.
2. The shock dose of hypertonic saline is 3-5 ml/kg for dogs and 2-3 ml/kg for cats. It is important to
remember that this small volume is equivalent to giving a full shock bolus of isotonic crystalloids!
Therefore, HSS should be administered "to effect" similar to the way that isotonic crystalloids are
administered in shock. Not every patient will require the full shock dose.
3. There are several different concentrations of hypertonic saline solutions available commercially:
a. 23.4% sodium chloride: Calculate the total dose to be administered based upon a 3-5 ml/kg dose in
the dog or a 2-3 ml/kg dose in the cat. Dilute 1 part HSS into 2 parts dextran-70 or hydroxyethyl starch
mixed in the same syringe to achieve the desired total dose. This will effectively make a 7.8% solution.
b. 7.0-7.5% sodium chloride: This solution should not be further diluted with an artificial colloid. If a

they may promote ongoing blood loss or re-bleeding in some patients.
that a rebound increase in intracranial pressure may result once these therapies are discontinued.
il. Artificial colloids:

isotonic crystalloids and limiting the risk for edema formation.
a. Hydroxyethyl starches (HES) (i.e., Hetastarch and Pentastarch):
i. An amylopectin polymer with an average molecular weight of 400-450 kD. However, the number
is approximately 70 kD.
iil. Because of the larger molecular size, HES has a longer duration of action compared to Dextran-70.
b. Dextrans:
i. Dextran-70, a glucose polymer, has an average molecular weight of 70 kd. Because degree of volume
expansion is related to the number of molecules present, rather than the size of those molecules,
ii. Dextran-40: This artificial colloid is not recommended for use in the hypovolemic patient. while this

to be more sensitive to volume overload with this product, resulting in pulmonary edema and/or pleura
effusion. These products can be used alone or in combination with isotonic crystalloids for resuscitation.
4. Oxyglobin will discolor mucous membranes, plasma and urine, thus interfering with chromogenic
biochemical monitoring techniques. With Oxyglobin use, whole blood hemoglobin concentrations should
be monitored to estimate red blood cell counts, rather than measurement of packed cell volume.
iv. Blood products:
1. Fresh whole blood or packed red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma may all be needed for
resuscitation of the traumatized patient. Transfusion of red blood cells during the early stabilizing phase
2. An additional benefit of early red blood cell transfusion is enhanced coagulation via release of platelet
around the vessel wall.
3. The downside to early red blood cell transfusion is that stored blood products become depleted in 2,3

can be used from standard blood gas analysis as an estimate of lactic acidosis and presence of ongoing
 anerobic metabolism. A normal base deficit is +4 to -4 mmol/L in dogs and +2 to -2 mmol/L in cats.

d. Animals with more severe respiratory compromise at presentation should be monitored for response to

e. Respiratory rate, effort, and pattern should be frequently reassessed in the trauma patient.

h. Visual assessment of the respiratory system:
include postural changes such as neck extension and elbow abduction, paradoxical abdominal breathing,
so as to avoid respiratory and/or cardiac arrest.
ii. Respiratory rate:
 1. Normal respiratory rate in veterinary patients is considered to be 24-48 breaths per minute.

motions and is perceived as labored or difficulty in breathing. Signs of increased respiratory effort include
inspiration. Open-mouthed breathing may be a sign of severe respiratory distress in cats but may also
occur due to injury to the nasal passages and sinuses. An increase in respiratory effort in the trauma
patient can be seen with pleural space disease (e.g., pneumothorax, hemothorax, or diaphragmatic

obstruction or injury.
3. Decreased respiratory effort is less commonly seen, and is characterized by decreased chest and
abdominal muscle movement. Disease processes associated with decreased respiratory effort include

Thoracic Injury.
i. Auscultation of the respiratory system:
changes in the patient's condition.
 ii. Abnormal breath sounds in trauma patients include those heard from a distance and those that require
the aid of a stethoscope:
1. Abnormal sounds of breathing heard from a distance, such as stridor (high pitched sounds of upper
airway origin) or stertor (lower pitched sounds of pharyngeal origin) should be noted and investigated
further:
a. Stridor occurs where there is damage or obstruction to the upper airways.
b. Stridorous sounds often cause referred upper airway noise on thoracic auscultation. Caution must
therefore be exercised to prevent the noise being inaccurately attributed to intrathoracic pathology.
Laryngeal and tracheal auscultation will aid in localization of the noise.
2. The thorax should be regularly ausculted in a systematic manner. Auscultation should be more
frequent if the patient has increased respiratory rate and/or effort:
a. Each hemithorax should be divided into dorsal, middle, and ventral lung fields. Within each field,
depending on the size of the patient, there should be two to three cranial to caudal zones of auscultation
within each third of the thorax.
b. Each lung field should be ausculted and compared to the adjacent and contralateral fields.
c. A decrease in, or absence of lung sounds (in one or both sides of the thorax) in the trauma patient is
chylothorax), or organ displacement (e.g., diaphragmatic hernia). The detection of clinically significant
pleural space disease is a physical examination diagnosis; imaging techniques should NOT be necessary.
d. Dull lung sounds heard dorsally on auscultation are consistent with pneumothorax. This is a common
diagnostic and therapeutic.

In the acute trauma patient, this fluid is usually blood; thoracocentesis is both diagnostic and therapeutic
Accumulation of chyle due to rupture of the thoracic duct also may cause these physical examination
findings 24-96 hours after trauma occurs.
f.Patients with a diaphragmatic hernia may present with dull lung sounds ventrally and/or dorsally.
CT or MRl may be necessary to confirm a diagnosis. Following patient stabilization, emergent surgical
intervention is indicated.
g. Crackles heard on thoracic auscultation in the trauma patient are indicative of pulmonary contusion(s)
Since contusions often progress before they resolve, frequent reassessment through auscultation and
objective assessment of oxygenation is important.
h. Dyspneic trauma patients with both pleural space disease AND pulmonary contusion may have normal
lung sounds
 j. Mucous membrane assessment:
i. Mucous membranes should be assessed during and following patient stabilization, and then every 2-6
hours thereafter, depending on the patient's condition.
ii. Membranes may be pale secondary to vasoconstriction (hypoperfusion, pain/catecholamines) or
anemia.

a. The area should be clipped and aseptically prepared.
b. The pulse of the artery is palpated with the nondominant hand.

used:

prior to obtaining the sample. Once the artery has been punctured, the syringe will self-fill to the desired

arterial puncture.
iil. Alternatively, one can manually aspirate the barrel of the syringe once the artery has been punctured,
although this is more technically challenging.
iv. when an arterial blood gas kit is not available, a 1 cc syringe attached to a 25 gauge needle can be
used. The needle and syringe should be coated with heparin and the plunger of the syringe will need to be
manually aspirated following arterial puncture.
d. The needle of the arterial blood gas syringe is introduced through the skin and directed parallel to the
long axis of the palpated arterial pulse. Adequate restraint is required; arterial blood sampling is an
uncomfortable process due to the neurovascular bundle adjacent to the artery:

 ii. With glass syringes, PCOz will increase and POz will decrease as nucleated cells utilie oxygen the
longer the sample stands from collection to analysis.
ili. With plastic syringes, both PcOz and POz tend to increase with time as oxygen diffuses from the
plastic into the blood sample at a rate greater than its utilization.
iv. When heparin is utilized to coat syringes for ABG analysis, its potential effect on diagnostic results
must be considered. Heparin will decrease pH and PCOz, while increasing POz. Sample dilution should
therefore be minimized. The amount of heparin to anticoagulate the sample should amount to 0.05-0.10

a. Hypoxemia is defined as a PaOz less than 80 mm Hg. When the PaOz is less than 60 mm Hg, strategies
to increase patient oxygenation should be implemented.
b. Hypoventilation is defined as a PaCO2 greater than 45 mm Hg. When a patient's PaCOz exceeds 60 mm
Hg (or 45 mm Hg if traumatic brain injury) strategies to improve ventilation should be implemented.
c. The PaOz should be approximately five times greater than the inspired oxygen concentration.

e. Calculation of the alveolar-arterial (P(A-a)Oz) gradient provides objective information on pulmonary

v. End-tidal capnometry (ETCO2):
1. End-tidal capnometry (ETcOz) is the measure of carbon dioxide in expired gas and provides an
assessment of ventilation.
2. The use of end tidal capnometry is reserved for patients who are intubated or have a tracheostomy
tube in place.
3. ETcOz provides a continuous, noninvasive estimate of dissolved carbon dioxide in arterial blood
(PaCOz). Figure 4.-5 shows a waveform generated by an end tidal capnograph.

4. Hypoventilation is defined as an ETcOz greater than 45 mm Hg. In the trauma patient, hypoventilation
may be observed secondary to head and spinal trauma, drugs that influence respiratory drive (e.g.,
opiates, propofol), or severe pulmonary parenchymal/pleural space disease. When ETcOz exceeds 60 mm
Hg (or 45 mm Hg if traumatic brain injury), strategies to improve ventilation should be implemented.
5. ETCOz is usually 1-4 mm Hg lower than PaCOz.A larger gradient between ETCOz and PaCOz may exist
ETCOz should therefore be periodically correlated to a PaCOz by arterial blood gas analysis.
6. ETcOz is closely correlated to cardiac output and may be used to assess the effectiveness of chest
compressions during cardiopulmonary cerebral resuscitation (CPcR).
7. An original study in healthy, sedated dogs demonstrated that end-tidal COz sampled from an
intranasal catheter provided an acceptable alternative for determining ventilation when compared to
arterial samples. The effectiveness of this means of assessing ventilation function has not been evaluated 
in diseased patients (Pang et al., 2007).

1.
 Causes of trauma-induced bradycardia include severe hypoxemia, electrolyte abnormalities
(hyperkalemia), increased intracranial pressure (Cushing's reflex; see Neurologic section), myocardial
reversal agents and/or re-evaluation of dosages may need to be considered.
b. Pulse quality:
 and diastolic pulse pressures (the height of the pulse wave) and the duration of the pulse waveform (the
width) (Figure 4.-6).
FLGURE4.-6
Line diagrams of descriptions of pulse quality, from left to right: normal pulse pressure, weak pulse, bounding

il. Arteries most commonly used to assess pulse quality include the femoral, dorsal metatarsal/dorsal
pedal, and radial arteries.
ii. Weak pulses have a decreased pulse pressure but normal width of the waveform, and are commonly
identified in hypovolemic trauma patients.
iv. Bounding pulses have a large pulse pressure difference and wide waveform, and are often felt with
vasodilation and increased stroke volume.
v. Snappy pulses have a normal pulse pressure but decreased waveform width, and are commonly seen
with anemia.
vi. Pulse quality and rate should be frequently assessed in the trauma patient to assess response to

perceptible differences when compared to the patient's core temperature. A palpably discernable
shock.
ilil. A reduction in the core to extremity temperature difference is expected following restoration of
normal perfusion.
e. Objective measures of cardiovascular monitoring:
i. A more objective assessment of the cardiovascular system can be achieved with the aid of an
electrocardiogram (EcG), blood pressure monitoring, and an emergency blood screen.
and assessing the trauma patient's response to therapy:
1. The trauma patient can be closely monitored with continuous ECG and blood pressure providing the
 clinician with the ability to detect acute and subtle changes in the patient's cardiovascular status.
2. Electrocardiography (ECG):
monitoring both heart rate and rhythm.
b. ECG monitoring in trauma patients is important as conduction abnormalities commonly occur
secondary to hypovolemia, hypoxemia, myocardial contusion, electrolyte abnormalities, variation in
sympathetic tone, and the release of inflammatory mediators. In addition, ECG gives moment to moment
information about heart rate, which can be an excellent indicator of the response of the hypovolemic
 patient to fluid thera py.
c. ECG is readily available and technically easy to use.
d. Metal alligator clips can be used for temporary monitoring.
e. Adhesive patches can be attached for long-term use (Ambu Blue Sensor N, Medicotest, Malaysia)
(Figure 4.-7).

although this position should be avoided if it compromises or stresses the patient.
h. Common ECG disturbances in trauma patients include sinus tachycardia, sinus bradycardia, accelerated
idioventricular rhythm, premature ventricular complexes, and ventricular tachycardia. ECG manifestations
of hyperkalemia (spiked T waves, prolonged PR interval, loss of P waves, and widening of the QRS) may
occur in patients with urinary tract disruption
i. Treatment of cardiac dysrhythmias should be based on heart rate, clinical signs, evidence of perfusion
abnormalities, treatment of underlying cause, and presence of multiform complexes or the "R on T"
phenomenon.
j. Dysrhythmias, considered secondary to hypovolemia, hypoxemia, or excessive catecholamines should
be treated by correction of the underlying cause.
k. A uniform ventricular rhythm with a heart rate of 140 beats per minute or less is considered an
accelerated idioventricular rhythm. In the absence of perfusion abnormalities attributed to this rhythm,
definitive treatment with an antidysrhythmic is not warranted. Maintenance of euvolemia, adequate
oxygenation, and normal acid-base and electrolyte status is indicated. F

3.Bloodpressuremonitoring:
a. Monitoring of blood pressure is extremely useful in the trauma patient and allows fluid therapy to be
tailored to a patient's needs.
b. Arterial and central venous blood pressure can be measured, providing valuable information on
volume status and perfusion.
c. Arterial blood pressure:

decrease in heart rate if intracranial pressure increases (Cushing's reflex) (see Chapter 7: Traumatic brain
injury). Therefore, close monitoring of arterial blood pressure in head trauma patients is warranted.
ii. Blood pressure can be used as a surrogate marker of blood flow to tissues. However, intense
vascular beds may have differing blood flow at the same blood pressure.
iv. Normal blood pressure:
1. Normal blood pressure values for dogs:
a. Systolic pressures of 110-190 mm Hg
b. Diastolic pressures of 55-110 mm Hg
2. Normal blood pressure values for cats:
a. Systolic pressures of 120-170 mm Hg
b. Diastolic pressures of 70-120 mm Hg
3. Hypertension:
a. Hypertension becomes a concern when systolic pressure increases above 170 mm Hg, or diastolic
pressure is greater than 110 mm Hg.
b. Following head trauma, systolic pressures of greater than 140 mm Hg (with a heart rate of less than

presence of adequate or increased cardiac output.
v. Indirect (noninvasive) blood pressure monitoring:
1. Relies on the inflation of a cuff to occlude arterial flow, followed by measurement of the pressure at
which blood flow returns. The inflatable cuff is attached to a sphygmomanometer or directly to an
oscillometric blood pressure monitoring system.
2. Noninvasive blood pressure monitoring is readily available, relatively cheap, and easy to use.

a. Cuffs that are too large will give falsely low pressure readings.
b. Cuffs that are too small will generate falsely elevated pressure readings.
4. Doppler ultrasonographic determination of blood pressure:

animals.

c. A 10-MHz ultrasound probe is placed over an artery distal to the cuff. The Doppler sounds become
audible when pressure in the cuff is less than pressure in the artery.
d. Common arteries used for Doppler blood pressure measurement include the dorsal metatarsal, ulnar,
and tail arteries.
e. The probe should be kept perpendicular to the vessel and adequate amounts of ultrasonic gel used to
aid sound conduction (Figure 4.-9a--c).

5. Oscillometric blood pressure monitors:
a. These monitors utilize vibrations conducted to adjacent tissues by the return of blood flow to the
occluded artery to calculate systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure.
b. Sites for placement of the oscillometric cuff are the mid-antebrachium and metatarsus (Figure 4.-10a
and b).

d. The Dinamap (Critikon, Inc., Tampa, FL) may not be reliable in cats or very small dogs.
e. The Cardell (Sharn Veterinary, Inc., Tampa, FL) has been shown to be effective at determining systolic,
diastolic and mean pressures in anesthetized healthy cats (Pedersen et al., (2002)) as well as dogs.
f. Accuracy is limited in vasoconstricted patients or in patients with dysrhythmias.
6. At least three measurements should be obtained, and the average value recorded.
7. Inappropriate cuff size is the most common source of error with noninvasive blood pressure
 operator deficiencies, deflation rate, and failure to fully deflate the cuff between readings.

ii.  If the central venous catheter inserted is a double or triple lumen catheter (Arrow International,

needed. The distal port should be used for monitoring of CVP.
h. Methods of measuring CVP:
as described above for arterial blood pressure monitoring. Values obtained will typically be displayed
using mm Hg units.
ii.A standard water manometer may be used for intermittent CVP measurements. Values obtained will
be in cm HzO.
ili. The transducer or manometer should be at the level of the right heart, and all measurements taken
with the patient in the same position:
1. The manometer should be filled with normal (0.9%) saline and connected to the patient's central
venous catheter. A three-way stop-cock can be used between the manometer and patient's catheter to
facilitate flling the manometer and measuring CVP.
2. The manometer should be perpendicular to the patient with the bottom of the manometer level with
the right heart.
measurement is made when the meniscus of saline stops falling and instead fluctuates slightly around a
given number with each respiration.
4. The CvP should be read at end expiration to minimize the influence of changing intrapleural pressures
(due to breathing).

iv. PCV and TP should be interpreted together:
1. Immediately after acute hemorrhage, there will be no change in PCV or TP
2. TP will begin to decrease prior to a decrease in PCV.

5. A trauma patient with acute hemorrhage may therefore have a decreased TP with a normal (or even
increased) PCV.
6. Over time, PCV and TP will both be decreased as fluid continues to shift from the interstitial space into
the vasculature. Fluid therapy to correct hypovolemia will further this change (hemodilution).

 8. Normal TP in conjunction with decreased PCV implies anemia caused by something other than acute
blood loss.
9. A baseline PCV and TP value should be obtained at hospital presentation, and these values should be
monitored frequently (Q1-2 hours) for changes and response to therapy until stabilized.
10. Serial monitoring of PCV and TP is necessary to tailor a trauma patient's fluid and transfusion needs.

perceived. The types of nerves that carry the initial pain impulses are classified on the basis of myelination and
size, which determines the type of pain they sense:
i. A8 fibers transmit acute, well-localized, pin-prick pain.
ii. C-fibers transmit more chronic, less well-localized, aching pain.
ili. Aβ fibers are associated with normal touch sensation and are ordinarily not associated with nociceptive
pain. In pathologic conditions; however, their transmission may be perceived as painful.

i. Descending tracts from the brain may modify pain transmission at the synapse.
ii. Signals from local interneurons may also influence synaptic transmission.

e. Pathologic pain states:
i. Hyperalgesia: an exaggerated response greater than the magnitude of the nociceptive input.
ii. Allodynia: the perception of an innocuous stimulus as painful.
ili. Wind-up: a state where the spinal cord has an increased responsiveness to nociceptive stimuli as a
result of chronic activation (e.g., from a chronic painful condition).

2.CATEGORIES OF PAIN SECONDARY TO TRAUMA
a. Primary tissue trauma:
i. Direct tissue injury (e.g., laceration or tearing of skin or muscle).
 ii. Fractures or other orthopedic pain (e.g., joint pain).
b. Secondary tissue trauma (inflammation):
recruit leukocytes to the site of injury to help fight infection and remove debris.
c. Compartment syndrome:
i. Associated with hemorrhage or fluid accumulation into a closed space.
ii. May also be caused by large-scale tissue swelling associated with inflammation or edema.
ill. Pressure on the tissues of the compartment and decreased oxygen delivery (due to vessel compression
or disru ption) causes ischemia and necrosis:
1. Release of potassium and hydrogen ion from dying cells sensitizes nociceptors.
2. Upregulation of cox increases tissue PGEz, which also sensitizes nerve fibers.
iv. Direct compression of nerves and nerve roots may also cause severe pain and neurologic deficit.
d. Crush injury:
i. Direct destruction of muscle tissue causing cellular leakage of hydrogen and potassium, as well as
the injured area (reperfusion).
e.Anxiety:
i. From initial traumatic event
ii. Hypovolemia secondary to blood loss
ili. Injury and transport to unfamiliar settings
iv. Can contribute to and intensify the pain experience

a. Cardiovascular (see Chapter 3: Shock in the Trauma Patient):
i. Changes in blood volume (hypovolemia):
1. Hemorrhage:
in further physiologic changes (e.g., lactic acidosis).
b. Hypovolemia alone will also compromise tissue perfusion and thus oxygen delivery to tissues.
2. Relative hypovolemia:
i. Shock states
iil. Changes in cardiac performance:
1. Myocardial contusions +/- direct tissue damage (e.g., from hypoxia)
2. Arrhythmias
b. Respiratory (see Chapter 6: Trauma-Associated Thoracic Injury):
i. Pleural space disease:
1. Decreased functional residual capacity (FRC) results in inability to ventilate and oxygenate, as the lungs
may not be fully expanded.
2. Rib fractures may cause an additional decrease in FRC as pain prohibits a normal inspiratory effort.
3. Pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.
4. Hemothorax.
5. Chylothorax.
ii. Pulmonary parenchymal disease:
1. Pulmonary contusion is often the sequelae to blunt thoracic trauma, and is characterized by
hemorrhage into the lung parenchyma:
inequality:
i. Hypoxemia
ii. Hypercarbia
2. Pulmonary edema:
a. May result from trauma that causes a transient airway obstruction or head trauma (noncardiogenic
edema).
b. May result from inadequate cardiac function (cardiogenic edema):
heart disease may decompensate secondary to trauma.
esophagus:
i. Bladder rupture, ureteral avulsion, urethral tear.
1. May not be immediately obvious.
2. May need contrast urography to obtain a definitive diagnosis.
a. Hyperkalemia
b. Metabolic acidosis 
4. Leakage of urine into the peritoneum or retroperitoneum is extremely inflammatory and painful.
d. Nervous system (see Chapter 7: Traumatic Brain Injury):

i. Severe trauma can lead to hemorrhage or necrosis of muscle:
1. Compartment syndrome possible, although rare.
2. Danger of reperfusion injury, if blood supply is initially compromised.
4.ASSESSMENT OF PAIN
a. In human and veterinary emergency rooms, pain is undertreated. This could be due to:
i. Unknown/unrecognized pain
ii. Concerns about side effects of analgesics
i. The visual analogue scale (VAS) is a simple method to record the pain level of the patient (Eigure 5.-1a):

2. The vAS may be evaluated prior to analgesic administration and following analgesia, and should result
in a decrease in VAS score if analgesia is adequate.

1. Most use a combination of physiologic parameters and clinical observations:
a. The University of Melbourne Pain Scale (UMPS) evaluates physiological parameters (heart rate,
respiratory rate, rectal temperature, etc.), activity, posture, vocalization, mental state, and, most
Haldane, (1999).
b. The Glasgow pain scale is designed for dogs, and also evaluates the patient in an interactive context
(Holton et al., 1998).
5.CHOICE OF ANALGESIC DRUGS FOR TRAUMA VICTIMS
a. Analgesic drug choices are based on educated decisions that result in utilization of a drug or combination of
drugs that best address the type of pain and physiologic state of the patient.
b. Multi-modal analgesia (using more than one drug with different mechanisms of action) is a wise choice:
i. Synergism between drugs may allow equivalent analgesia at lower doses, reducing side effects.
iil. Less likely to compromise the patient's physiology.
6.DRUG TYPES
a. Opioids:
i. Opioids are potent, effective analgesic drugs that are frequently indicated for acute analgesia of the
trauma patient.
ii. Analgesia is provided from interactions with opiate receptors in the periphery, spinal cord, and brain.
ili. Three major types of opioid rece ptors:
1. μ (mu) receptors:
a. Located spinally, supraspinally, and peripherally.
b. Agonism provides analgesia.
2. k (kappa) receptors:
a. Located spinally, supraspinally, and peripherally. Their distribution varies between species.
b. Receptors provide analgesia, especially of the viscera, and specific agonists may be useful in the
 treatment of intraabdominal disease.
3. & (delta) receptors:
a. Provide primarily spinal analgesia.
iv. Opioid drugs are characterized by their receptor activation profile. Knowing this profile allows for
selection of appropriate drugs for each patient:
1. Agonism at opioid receptors may have variable effects between species; notably, cats have a higher
incidence of arousal and hyperactive behavior after ad ministration of full opioid agonists.
vi.
Opioids may be combined with tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines, acepromazine) for
neuroleptanalgesia, a synergistic interaction with sedative and analgesic properties.

d. Butorphanol may also be used as an anti-emetic and anti-tussive agent.
e. Due to its antagonism at the mu receptor, butorphanol may be used as a partial reversal agent for the
adverse effects caused by the mu opioid agonist drugs (e.g., excessive sedation or respiratory depression),
while preserving a degree of analgesia:
i. Smaller doses of butorphanol (0.005-0.050 mg/kg IV), may be used for this effect.
 ii. To preserve a degree of analgesia, the dose may be titrated to the desired effect.
 x. Opioid antagonists:
1. Add to the utility of this class of drugs; if adverse effects occur, the antagonists have equally flexible
routes for dosing and are rapidly effective.

a. To reverse the effects of opioids in dogs and cats, doses range from 0.02 to 0.04 mg/kg IM, IV, SQ, and
intratracheally, and may be re peated as necessary.
b. Naloxone has been used as a CRl (0.2 mg/kg/h) in cases of massive opioid overdose (da Cunda, 2007).
causing adverse effects (e.g., dysphoria) in a patient.
xi. Opioid side effects:
1. Respiratory:
a. Opioids decrease the responsiveness of the respiratory center to elevated arterial carbon dioxide levels
(hypercarbia). Consequently, hypoventilation and possibly hypoxemia may occur, especially in patients
with respiratory compromise.

b. Benzodiazepines:
i. Provide relaxation and anxiolysis, especially when combined with opioids:
1. Benzodiazepines work by potentiating the effects of gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) in the CNS,
which causes hyperpolarization of nerve membranes and decreased transmission resulting in sedation
and muscle relaxation.
ii. Diazepam (Valium):

4. Due to alpha-1 antagonism, may cause vasodilation and splenomegaly:
a. Relative hypovolemia, hypotension, and apparent anemia may result.
b. The sequestration of red blood cells in the spleen caused by this drug could also cause a significant
 decrease in oxygen delivery to tissues
c. Due to the possible hypotensive effects of this drug and the inability to reverse its effects, it should be
used sparingly in the trauma patient.

d. Alpha-2 agonists:
i. Available as both less selective (e.g., xylazine) and more selective (e.g., medetomidine) drugs at the
 alpha-2 adrenergic receptor; these drugs have both sedative and analgesic qualities.
ii. These drugs may be administered via many different routes (Iv, IM, SQ), as well as epidurally:
1. Doses of medetomidine for analgesia in dogs and cats can range from 0.002 to 0.03 mg/kg, depending
on the use of adjunct analgesics.
2. Systemic cardiovascular effects will be seen regardless of route of administration.

much more reliable sedation for aggressive or potentially dangerous animals.
e. Dissociative agents:
i. Ketamine and Tiletamine (combined with zolazepam in Telazol) are the most common dissociative
 anesthetic agents used in small animal veterinary practice.
ii. The dissociative anesthetics have an incompletely understood anesthetic action. They are antagonists at
the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.

These drugs may be combined in the same syringe for administration, but combinations with diazepam will form a
cloudy emulsion that will not affect drug potency. These protocols may also be supplemented with judicious use
of propofol (0.5-1 mg/kg IV slowly) as long as blood pressure and respirations are in the normal range. Always
consider intubation when utilizing propofol. The full opioid agonists have been deemphasized due to the potential
for excitatory reactions.
vi. Cardiovascular effects:
1. The dissociative agents are thought of as cardiovascularly sparing drugs, but this may not be the case in
 a trauma patient, especially if combined with hypovolemia or myocardial trauma.
2.
 While ketamine alone is a myocardial depressant, administration will result in a concomitant
 sympathetic stimulus, which more than offsets the depression, in healthy patients:
seen with ketamine's use.
b. In the trauma patient, depleted sympathetic reserve may limit the degree to which the animal can
c. In the hypovolemic trauma patient, the sympathetic stimulation may also fail to fully compensate for
the myocardial depression.
vii. Respiratory effects:

1. Cox produces prostaglandins that contribute to the tissue changes associated with inflammation.
2. Inhibition of cox results in decreased production of both homeostatic and pro-inflammatory
prostanoids.
ii. NSAiDs have relatively little effect on the cardiorespiratory system, but are contraindicated in the
trauma patient with poor perfusion:

ii. The veterinary NsAIDs are predominantly orally administered medications, with the exception of
carprofen (Rimadyl), meloxicam (Metacam@), and ketoprofen (Ketofen?), which have injectable forms:

from the anti-inflammatory properties of short-term NsAlD ad ministration.
v. Used alone, the NsAiDs are unlikely to be adequate for acute posttraumatic pain. It is imperative to
1. It is frequently safer to wait at least 12-24 hours posttrauma in some patients prior to administering
NSAIDs.
vi. NSAiDs are used with caution in cats; in addition to sometimes unpredictable metabolism (via hepatic
glucuronidation), the possibility of subclinical renal insufficiency in many cats may predispose some
patients to acute renal failure.

3. Propofol decreases the cerebral metabolic rate and is a good drug for use in patients who have
sustained head trauma, as long as ventilation and perfusion parameters are monitored and adequate
ventilation and cardiovascular support are provided.
 4. There is a possibility that repeated propofol anesthetics in cats may predispose to Heinz-body anemia.
ill. Thiopental (Pentothal):
1. An ultra-short-acting barbiturate, thiopental is an effective and safe induction agent. It is available,

from 2 to 6 mg/kg, and is given to effect.
2. Like propofol, the side effects of thiopental should be considered critically prior to use in critically ill or
traumatized patients. Dose-related cardiovascular and respiratory depression may make this drug a poor
choice for the traumatized animal:
a. The high pH will cause damage if injected perivascularly, so an intravenous catheter should be placed
prior to usage.

7. Local anesthetics are frequently used to provide analgesia for patients with chest tubes. See this
section for specific recommendations.
vi. Inhalant anesthetics:
1. The most commonly used inhalants in small animal practice are isoflurane and sevoflurane.
2. The inhalants produce reversible, dose-dependent CNS unresponsiveness:

4. Inhalant anesthetics cause dose-dependent cardiovascular depression:
a. A dose-dependent decrease in arterial blood pressure is observed with the use of inhalants:
i. The decrease in arterial blood pressure primarily occurs secondary to vasodilation.
5. The inhalant anesthetics decrease cere bral metabolism:

8. Mask or box inductions should be avoided in the trauma patient, as a higher concentration of inhalant
anesthetic is needed for intu bation with this method.

b. The addition of a tranquilizer to an opioid results in a much smoother and more reliable sedation.
2. Opioid and benzodiazepine (see Iables 5.-2 and 5.-3):
a. Very effective combination in debilitated patients, causing minimal cardiovascular depression.
b. Hydromorphone with diazepam or midazolam:
i. Lower doses (especially of the benzodiazepine) should be used in the cat.
c. Opioid and acepromazine (see Iables 5.-2 and 5.-3):

a. Both drugs can be reversed at the end of the procedure.
b. Buprenorphine is not recommended due to its minimal sedative qualities and long latent period before

c. Many different endotracheal tube sizes (widths and lengths) should be available; even a small tube will
allow the administration of oxygen during the procedure.
3. Preparation:
a. Prior to administration of any drugs (if there is time), it is important to preoxygenate the patient; this
can delay the onset of hypoxia by minutes.

2. In addition to the usual CPR techniques involving intubation and the initiation of thoracic
compressions, it is important to reverse the analgesic drugs as well. In some studies, naloxone actually
had a favorable effect alone in rats after cardiopulmonary arrest. In the authors' hands, vasopressin
(0.4-0.8 U/kg) is an extremely effective drug for anesthetic-related CPA. Epinephrine is an effective drug

dog morphine at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg/h, how much morphine needs to be added to the IV fluid bag?
1. The liter of Normosol-R will last for 10 hours (1000 ml/100 mL/h).
3. The total amount of morphine to add to 1 liter of Normosol-R is thus 20 mg. for this dog (10 h * 2
mg/h).

 2. Possible blood loss from fractures or adjacent structures
 3. Possible trauma to the urogenital tract
Analgesic plan
Full opicid agonist +/- low-dose ketamine CRl and/or idocaine CRI
Considerations
1. Lidocaine may also be a helpful adjunct if cardiac arrhythmias, secondary to traumatic
myocarditis, are present.
2. A benzodiazepine may be added for anxiolysis as required.
3. Partial opioid agonists may not provide adequate analgesia for the degree of trauma,
and/or may need to be redosed at increased frequency
'ued pazewne Aainoe aue ul asn jiaun aieripuienuos alleuassa uoisuaioday pue
Their use requires close monitoring.
 5. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NsAIDs) may be used as analgesics, but alone are not
adequate to control acute pain. Additionally, if there is continued bleeding, the nonselective
NSAIDs may inhibit platelet function and delay resolution.
Contraindications
1. Ketamine alone is unlikely to provide adequate analgesia for a patient in this scenario.
2. Acepromazine given to a patient with shock, or during active resuscitation, may result in
this patient.
4. There is no indication for corticosteroids.

2. Head trauma
 Analgesic plan
For moderate pain in cats, buprenorphine (0.01-0.02 mg/kg q. 6 hours). NSAIDs as an adjunct for analgesia.
Considerations
1. Some cats may develop excitation from full agonist opioids; however, a titrated
administration of full opioids will provide excellent analgesia. Concerns about respiratory
depression are also relevant; full opioids may have a more pronounced effect in the
presence of CNS disease.
 2. NSAIDs can be used provided the cat is systemically healthy (i.e., no history of renal
insufficiency, and there are no episodes of hypotension.
3. Benzodiazepines may be used for anxiolysis as necessary

4. Ketamine combined with a benzodiazepine is only a secondary choice due to the
suspected presence of arrhythmias. This combination is very flexible, however, and is used 
frequently despite the presence of myocardial contusions. It is more likely that the animal 
will maintain an appropriate respiratory rate with this combination.
Contraindication
1. In this case, providing analgesic drugs of any sort without the availability of intubation and

3. Intercostal nerve block at the time of thoracostomy tube placement
Considerations
1. The full opioid agonist can be added to a premedication prior to anesthetic induction if 
the patient is breathing well. lif air exchange is compromised due to the pneumothorax, the
respiratory depressant effects of the opioid would contraindicate its use and a rapid
sequence induction would be better for the patient.
 2. Thoracocentesis should be performed just prior to anesthetic induction to improve the
functional residual capacity.
3. Preoxegenation will help avoid cyanosis upon anesthetic induction.
4. NSAIDs will help with local tissue inflammation.
 Contraindications
 1. Partial opioid agonists may not be adequate for pain control in this patient.
 2. Vigorous positive pressure ventilation is contraindicated in this patient, as it may worsen
the pneumothorax.

Considerations
1. Prior to induction, doses of pressor agents (e.g., dopamine, dobutamine) should be
calculated and prepared.
2. Normotension will be difficult to maintain with the use of inhalant anesthetic.
 3. Hypotension should be treated aggressively with crystalloid, colloid, and blood products

injuries are a source of significant morbidity and may be fatal if not immediately identified and treated.
c. Thoracic trauma is often categorized as blunt or penetrating:
i. Blunt thoracic trauma is most common and is most often a result of vehicular trauma. However, animal-
animal interactions, human-animal interactions, and falls from a height are other common causes of blunt
injury. Most blunt thoracic injuries are managed medically; however, surgical intervention may be
indicated based on the type and severity of the blunt injury.
ii. Penetrating thoracic trauma is less common than blunt trauma and most often results from animal-
stabilized medically.

3.TRAUMA-ASSOCIATED PLEURAL SPACE INJURIES
a. Pneumothorax:
i. Definition and pathophysiology:
1. Pneumothorax is the accumulation of air in the pleural space.
2.
 Pneumothorax is one of the most common trauma-associated thoracic injuries. Pneumothorax
happens with such frequency that the author makes the assumption that pneumothorax is present until
proven otherwise.
3. As intrathoracic pressure increases from its normally subatmospheric level, atelectasis, ventilatory
 difficulty, and decreased venous return may result in respiratory and cardiovascular compromise:
inspiration but is unable to be evacuated. The progressive increases in intra-pleural pressure result in
both respiratory and cardiovascular collapse. Tension pneumothorax is a life-threatening emergency.
4. Pneumothorax is classified as open or closed:
a. Open pneumothorax results from penetrating injury to the thorax. Air from the environment enters
the pleural space through the chest wall.
b. Closed pneumothorax most often results from rapid compression of the chest against a closed glottis
resulting in disruption of the visceral pleura. Air enters the chest directly from the pulmonary
 parenchyma. Additional causes of closed pneumothorax after trauma include rupture of a subpleural bleb
Aepuonas pue wnuseipawownaud ui sunsau uonidnusip leaseudosa do Aemie aaiel se lam se elng io
pneumothorax.
c. Closed pneumothorax is far more common than open pneumothorax.
ii. Clinical signs/physical examination and oxygenation assessment:
1. Respiratory rate and effort:
a. Clinically significant pneumothorax will result in tachypnea, often characterized by shorter breaths with
perceived smaller tidal volumes.
Cyanosis may be noted in pneumothorax:
i. Animals with tension pneumothorax will display pale mucous membranes, prolonged CRT, tachycardia,
and poor pulse quality (see Chapter 3: Shock in the Trauma Patient). Jugular venous distention may be

noted at the top of the "arch" of the ribs.
c.  Pneumothorax is often accompanied by concurrent injuries to the chest. Auscultation should be
interpreted in light of the potential for concurrent injuries.
3. Objective indicators of oxygenation:
a. Pulse oximetry may document a decreased oxygen saturation of the arterial blood.
arterial blood. ABG analysis should not delay the rapid delivery of therapy for dogs and cats with
pneumothorax.
ili. Diagnostic tests:
1. Thoracocentesis:
a. Thoracocentesis is both diagnostic and therapeutic for dogs and cats with closed pneumothorax.
b. Equipment (assemble as indicated in Figure 6.-2):
i. 60 ml syringe.
FLGURE 6.-2
iil. 3-way stopcock.
ili. IV extension tubing.
iv. 19-21 g butterfly needle or 20-22 g needle.
v. Some will use an 18-22 g over-the-needle catheter for thoracocentesis. The author prefers a needle
because it will not collapse with respiratory motion.
c. Procedure:
i.
 Numerous techniques for thoracocentesis have been described. No single technique has been
 objectively evaluated and found to be superior to another.
iil. Position the patient in ste rnal recumbency.
Aaains ot d se sgu yiet pue yng aui uaamiag xeioui auijo z iesiop aui ahedaid pue di "!!
iv. Use sterile technique.
v. Landmarks for thoracocentesis for the treatment of pneumothorax are the dorsal 1/3 of the chest at
the level of the 9th to 11th rib spaces.
FLGURE 6.-3
While maintaining contact between the hand and the chest wall, insert needle perpendicular to the chest wall
staying close to the cranial edge of the rib.
vi. while maintaining contact between the hand and the chest wall insert needle perpendicular to the
chest wall staying close to the cranial edge of the rib to avoid the neurovascular bundle caudally. (Figure
6.-3).
vii. Advance the needle through the skin and aspirate the syringe. Advance and aspirate in 1-2 mm
increments until the pleural space is penetrated and air is retrieved.
vill. Retrieve air until the pleural space is empty and negative pressure is achieved.
ix. A sensation of "scratching" on the end of the needle or a small amount of blood in the hub of the
needle may signify that the needle is contacting the visceral pleura of the lung. If this sensation is noted,
the needle should be backed out slightly.
x. Because pneumothorax is most often bilateral, thoracocentesis should be performed on both sides of
the chest.
 making it an excellent diagnostic and therapeutic method for the management of pneumothorax.
2. Radiography:
a. Radiographs of dogs with clinically significant pneumothorax (Eigure 6.-4) probably should not exist
thoracocentesis.
FLGURE 6.-4
Lateral radiographic projection of a clinically significant pneumothorax. Note retraction of the lung from the chest
wall and the hypovascular space ventral to the heart.
b. Technique:
i. Radiography is stressful. All measures to stabilize the patient prior to radiography should be
undertaken:
1.Oxygen support
2. Fluid therapy if indicated for cardiovascular support
3. Thoracocentesis
4. Pain control and sedation
should be administered while radiographs are acquired.
c. Radiographic findings of pneumothorax:
'uoeiosuon oi anp ago luni aui jo aisuap paseaui pue lm isaun aui wog lunl aue jo uoeay !
ii. Lack of bronchovascular markings beyond the periphery of the lung.
iil. The appearance that the heart is "floating" on air on lateral radiographic projections. This finding
results from the heart falling to the side of the atelectatic lung lobe.
iv. Evidence of concurrent thoracic injuries.
3. Thoracic ultrasound (Lisciandro 2006):
the "glide sign" in normal dogs. The "glide-sign" results from the "sliding" interaction between the lung
b. Lack of a "glide sign" is supportive of a diagnosis of pneumothorax.
iv. Therapeutics:
1. Oxygen support:

space (pneumothorax) is increased, facilitating diffusion and thus resolution of pneumothorax. A second
mechanism of resolution may include more rapid closure of the lesion in the visceral pleura. (Zierold et al.,
2000) The clinical significance of this effect has not been evaluated objectively in clinical veterinary
medicine.

HORA-SE
2. Thoracocentesis (see above) should be the initial treatment choice for management of dogs and cats
with respiratory compromise secondary to pneumothorax:
b. Thoracostomy tube placement should be considered as the treatment of choice for dogs and cats with
recurrent pneumothorax requiring repeated thoracocentesis.
c. Failure to achieve negative pressure necessitates thoracostomy tube placement and establishment of
continuous pleural space drainage.
3. Thoracostomy tube placement:
a. Indications:
i. Sustained decompression of the pleural space in dogs and cats with pneumothorax when combined
with a continuous drainage system (Figure 6.-5). (Argyle Thora-Seal ll Chest Drainage Unit. Tyco
Healthcare Group LP/Covidien. Mansfield, MA.)
 ii. Intermittent manual decompression of the pleural space in dogs and cats with pneumothorax by
technical staff.
il. when combined with temporary closure of the thoracic wall, a thoracostomy tube is indicated for

i. All procedures should be performed to make thoracostomy tube placement as safe, efficient, and
sterile as possible. The author prefers to completely clip and aseptically prepare BOTH hemithoraces and
placement. Positive pressure ventilation after induction may make closed pneumothorax acutely worse.
il. Immediately after anesthesia induction, the patient is positioned in lateral recumbency (most affected

12th-13th rib space is now positioned over the 9th-11th rib space (Figure 6.-6). Upon completion of the
procedure, this maneuver will create a subcutaneous tunnel through which the thoracostomy tube

iv. The hemostat is used to hold the pleura open so that the thoracostomy tube can be advanced
between its jaws. The thoracostomy tube is initially directed perpendicular to the chest wall until it enters
the pleural space (Eigure 6.-8). The thoracostomy tube is then directed cranially and ventrally (Figure
6.-9). If the thoracostomy tube being utilized is placed over a stylet, the tube may be advanced off of the
stylet once the tube is 3-5 cm within the pleural space. Positioning of the chest tube in the cranial-ventral

3. Clinically significant hemothorax is relatively uncommon. It is the clinical impression of the author that
4.  Clinically significant hemothorax will result in both cardiovascular and respiratory dysfunction.
However, evidence of hypovolemia will precede evidence of respiratory distress assuming no additional
pleural space or pulmonary injuries are present:
a. Cardiovascular compromise in patients with hemothorax results from hypovolemia.
b. As intrathoracic pressure increases from its normally subatmospheric level, atelectasis (resulting in
ventilation-perfusion mismatch) and hypoventilation may contribute to hypoxemia.
5. The presence of concurrent hypovolemia and dyspnea generally results from four possible syndromes
 of injury:
a. Clinically significant hemothorax
b. Tension pneumothorax
c. Diaphragmatic hernia with a dilated stomach entrapped in the pleural space
d. Concurrent thoracic injury (most commonly, pneumothorax and/or pulmonary contusion) and acute
blood loss elsewhere in the body
ii. Clinical signs/physical examination and oxygenation assessment:
 1. Hypovolemia secondary to blood loss into the pleural space will result in a spectrum of clinical signs
Most often, pale mucous membranes, prolongation of the CRT, tachycardia, and poor pulse quality are
recognized.

vii. Retrieve effusion until the pleural space is empty and negative pressure results.
vili. A sensation of "scratching" on the end of the needle or a small amount of air in the hub of the needle
may signify that the needle is contacting the visceral pleura of the lung. If this "scratching" sensation is
noted, the needle should be backed out slightly.
ix. Because hemothorax is most often bilateral, thoracocentesis should be performed on both sides of the
chest.
x. Hemo-pneumothorax is also possible. Thoracocentesis for hemo-pneumothorax will result in retrieva
 of both air and blood from the pleural space. If hemopneumothorax is suspected using thoracocentesis,
assessment of the collection system for leaks should be performed to ensure the accuracy of the
hemopneumothorax diagnosis.

3. Radiography:
a. Radiographs of dogs with clinically significant hemothorax probably should not exist because the
 problem should have been identified on physical examination and treated through thoracocentesis.

undertaken:
1. Oxygen support
2. Fluid therapy if indicated for cardiovascular support
3. Thoracocentesis
4. Pain control and sedation
ii. DV projections may be substituted for VD projections in an effort to minimize stress. Oxygen therapy
should be administered while radiographs are acquired.

i. The author places a thoracostomy tube in dogs and cats with hemothorax when >10 ml/kg of
hemorrhagic fluid is retrieved from the pleural space after trauma:
1. Placement of a thoracostomy tube allows for sustained decompression of the pleural space helping
alleviate respiratory compromise.

diaphragm. In addition, direct trauma to the caudal thorax and insertions of the diaphragm on the body
wall may lead to diaphragmatic hernia.
3. Diaphragmatic hernia most often results in respiratory dysfunction:
b. On occasion, the stomach will become entrapped and severely distended within the pleural space
to high intrapleural pressures interfering with normal venous return (similar to tension pneumothorax).
4. The most common organs herniated into the thorax (in order) are (Gibson et al., 2005):
a. Liver

nasal cannulae cannot maintain SpOz above 90%, intubation and positive pressure ventilation should be
considered.
b. Evacuation of concurrent pleural effusion or pneumothorax via thoracocentesis will help maximize
SpOz and relieve respiratory difficulty.

i. Definition and pathophysiology:
1. Pulmonary contusion refers to a lesion of the lung that occurs after a compression-decompression
injury to the chest wall that results in hemorrhage and edema leading to alveolar collapse and lung

In this example, oxygen should be administered immediately and diagnostic thoracocentesis should be
pe rformed.
4. Additional physical examination findings:
a. Rib fractures should serve as a "flag" for pulmonary contusion. The chest wall is a resilient structure
and, as such, significant trauma is necessary to fracture the ribs. As these forces are transmitted to the
chest wall, they are also transmitted through the chest resulting in pulmonary contusion. For a more
complete discussion of rib fractures; see below.
b. In severe cases of pulmonary contusion, pulmonary compliance may be severely decreased and
paradoxical abdominal movement may be identified.
5. Objective indicators of oxygenation:
a. Pulse oximetry may document a decreased saturation of the arterial blood with oxygen.
b. Arterial blood gas analysis may document hypoxemia and a decreased saturation of the arterial blood
exchange abnormality will be observed. The author utilizes the arterial blood gas (A-a Gradient) to

(see Chapter 4: Monitoring of the Trauma Patient). ABG analysis should not delay the rapid delivery of
therapy for dogs and cats with pneumothorax.
i. Diagnostics:
1. Clinically significant pulmonary contusion is a physical examination diagnosis that is confirmed through
radiographic imaging.
2. Diagnostic imaging should be delayed until patient stability is achieved.
3. Radiographic findings in dogs and cats with pulmonary contusion may include the following:
a. Patchy interstitial to alveolar densities (Figure 6.-18).

bilaterally. An air bronchogram is visible in the right caudal lung lobe.
b. Other radiographic findings consistent with thoracic trauma.
c. Radiographic findings may lag slightly behind clinical signs:
i. Clinically significant pulmonary contusion (those severe enough to cause respiratory compromise) will
be radiographically evident independent of time.
4. Pulmonary contusion is easily identified using CT.
iv. Therapeutics:
1. Treatment of dogs and cats with pulmonary contusion is largely supportive in nature and consists of
optimizing oxygenation through supplemental oxygen support, pain control, judicious fluid therapy, good 
nursing practices, management of concurrent injuries, and positive pressure ventilatory support if
ou aie aaue 'allag seindod anidsaa sulis ieruio pue sisaieue ses pooia ieae uo paseg 'pateiu
 specific medications that are likely to improve outcome in dogs and cats with pulmonary contusion.
2. Optimize oxygenation:
a. Supplemental oxygen support (cage, nasal cannulae) should be administered to maintain SpOz above
90% (approximate PaOz = 60 mm Hg)
i. Inability to maintain SpOz >90% or PaOz > 60 mm Hg with supplemental oxygen support (FiOz<0.6 =
60% inspired oxygen).
il. Inability to maintain PaCOz < 60 mm Hg. Because carbon dioxide diffuses very easily across the alveolar
membranes, hypercarbia is a relatively uncommon reason to initiate PpV in dogs and cats with pulmonary
contusion.
ii. Increases in respiratory rate and effort that are unlikely to be sustainable or that do not allow the
patient to sleep/rest.
iv. Older literature suggests that dogs and cats that require PPv for the management of pulmonary
contusion have approximate survival rates of 30% (Campbell and King, 2000; Powell et al., 1999),

other concurrent injuries (see Chapter 5: Anesthesia and Analgesia for the Trauma Patient).
b. Appropriate analgesia will decrease pain and improve the patient's ability to take deeper {larger tidal
volume), slower breaths. Larger tidal volumes may help prevent atelectasis.
4. Nursing care:
a. Many dogs and cats that have sustained pulmonary contusion also sustain additional injuries including
major orthopedic injuries. These patients are often unable or reluctant to turn themselves or walk:
hau jo uoeiou e sasn souine aui 'sinoy omi aaaa pauani ag pinous ilem oi algeun aie teun siuaed !
lateral, right sternal, sternal, left sternal, and left lateral recumbencies to help prevent dependent
atelectasis.
il. If the patient can stand but is unable to walk, he/she should be placed in a standing position every 4
hours and turned as described above.
ili. Short walks can be accomplished even if the patient is oxygen-dependent using portable oxygen
cylinders and flow regulators.
b. Immobility contributes to atelectasis, which can worsen pulmonary function in patients with lung
injury. Varying body position, standing, and short walks may help combat atelectasis and recruit alveoli to
participate in gas exchange.
5. Fluid therapy in the patient with pulmonary contusion:
contusion. Some argue that synthetic colloids or hypertonics offer advantages because they provide
colloids is the same as crystalloids because the colloids will draw fluid from the interstitial space:

ii. Fluid should be administered to provide for maintenance and ongoing losses.
ili. Excessive fluid administration should be avoided. Increased pulmonary vascular permeability

b. Furosemide:
i. Furosemide is traditionally administered for the purpose of decreasing preload in hydrostatic

ili.  The author finds that the administration of furosemide simply complicates fluid therapy by adding
another factor into fluid therapy balance.
c. Bronchodilators:
 i. Bronchodilators are traditionally administered to animals with reactive small airway diseases such as
chronic bronchitis or feline asthma. These conditions are characterized by reactive small airways, smooth
 muscle thickening of the small airways, and increased mucous production.

impacted by concurrent injuries.
b. Blebs and bullae:

 1. A pulmonary bleb is defined as a small pocket of air located within the visceral pleura. It likely occurs
due to damage to alveoli with rupture and leakage of air into the interstitium and dissection into the
pleura.

5.TRAUMA-ASSOCIATED THORACIC WALL INJURIES
a. Rib fractures:
i. Definition and pathophysiology:
1. Rib fractures may result from blunt or penetrating thoracic trauma.
2. The canine and feline thorax is a relatively resilient structure. Rib fractures should serve as a "flag" for
concurrent thoracic injury.
3. Pulmonary contusion is commonly associated with rib fractures.
4. Sequelae of rib fractures include the following:
b. Pneumothorax: Pneumothorax may occur if the broken rib(s) penetrate the visceral pleura.
space. Hemothorax may occur if the broken rib(s) penetrate the visceral pleura and disrupt the pulmonary
vasculature.
ii. Clinical signs/physical examination and oxygenation assessment:
1. Clinical signs:
a. Animals with isolated rib fractures may not display any overt clinical signs.
b. At times, the pain associated with rib fractures will make the patient breathe in a more rapid, shallow

3. Objective indicators of oxygenation:
a. Isolated rib fractures are unlikely to affect oxygenation (SpOz and PaOz).
atelectasis may result in hypoxemia due to ventilation-perfusion mismatch.
Ill. Diagnostics:
1. Many rib fractures are diagnosed based on physical examination.
2.  Survey (3-view) thoracic radiography may demonstrate additional rib fractures not identified on
 physical examination:
a. Occasionally, review of thoracic radiographs in an inverted position aids in the identification of rib
fractures.
 3. Some rib fractures are probably not identified on either physical examination or thoracic radiographs.
iv. Therapeutics:
1. Most rib fractures do not require specific treatment beyond pain control:
a. Systemic:

v. Monitoring:
1. Animals with rib fractures should be monitored for discomfort and pain should be controlled as
needed.
3. Monitoring appropriate for concurrent thoracic injuries should be undertaken.
vi. Prognosis:

ii. Clinical signs/physical examination and oxygenation assessment:
1. Flail chest is a physical examination diagnosis:
a. During inspiration, as intrapleural pressure becomes more negative, the chest wall moves outward and
the flail segment moves inward in the direction of negative pressure.
b. During expiration, as intrapleural pressure becomes less negative, the chest wall recoils and the flail
segment moves outward.
2. Additional physical examination findings consistent with thoracic trauma may be noted.
3. Objective indicators of oxygenation:
a. Flail chest causes hypoxemia via multiple methods:

b. Surgical intervention is directed at debriding damaged tissues, lavage, establishing drainage, and
closure. Internal thoracic wall stabilization may be performed using IM pins, interfragmentary wires,
suture approximation, or bone plates.
see Chapter 5 for a full discussion of analgesic techniques in the patient that has sustained trauma.
v. Monitoring:

1. Clinical signs:
a. Some penetrating thoracic injuries are quite obvious.
i. Direct visualization of intrathoracic structures implies penetrating injury.
 ii. Air may be heard moving into and out of the pleural space creating a "sucking" sound.
b. Very often, there is no external evidence that a wound over the thorax penetrates into the pleural

 ii. Reestablishing negative intrapleural pressure will help stabilize the patient:
1. Rapidly clip and surgically prepare the wound edges.
2. Place a thoracostomy tube through a segment of normal thoracic wall; see 3. a. iv. 3.
3. Two options exist for "closing" the thoracic cavity:
a. Close the skin over the large thoracic wound to create an airtight seal.
b. Place a large, sterile, adhesive drape (Op-Syte, Smith & Nephew Medical Ltd., Hull, England) or loban (3

b. Irregular cardiac rhythms on auscultation with concurrent pulse deficits most commonly suggest
ventricular arrhythmias.
c. Clinical signs of poor peripheral perfusion (pale mucous membranes, prolonged CRT, poor peripheral
pulse quality, cool extremities) may be noted if the arrhythmia is affecting cardiac output.
3. Oxygenation assessment:
a. Because cardiac arrhythmias may result from hypoxemia, oxygen saturation, or arterial blood gas
should be assessed and oxygen should be provided as needed to maintain SpOz>90%.
ii. Diagnostics:
1. Electrocardiography (ECG):
 a. Cardiac arrhythmias are definitively identified based on ECG.
iv. Therapeutics:
 1. Ventricular arrhythmias:
the arrhythmia, overall rate, perfusion status, and likelihood that the arrhythmia will degenerate into a
terminal arrhythmia (ventricular fibrillation). Because prospective studies have not been performed to
evaluate various treatment strategies, many treatment decisions are based on personal experience and
opinion.
b. Life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias should be treated immediately:
1. Rates > 180 bpm in dogs. Above 180 bpm, diastolic filling time and thus stroke volume and cardiac
output are compromised. The author treats dogs with rates >140 bpm to minimize myocardial work and
energy consumption as well as to facilitate patient comfort.
2. R on T phenomena.
4. Some believe multiform (arrhythmias that appear electrocardiographically different) and multifocal

lf. Lidocaine:
1. Dogs: 2 mg/kg IV bolus (repeated up to 3 times) followed by CRl at 40-80 μg/kg/min will control most
ventricular arrhythmias.

ii. Procainamide:
 1. Ventricular arrhythmias refractory to lidocaine may respond to procainamide.
2. Dog: 6-8 mg/kg over 1-2 minutes followed by 25-50 μg/kg/min CRl.
ill. Most trauma-associated cardiac arrhythmias respond well to lidocaine and procainamide. Additional
pharmacologic considerations in refractory arrhythmias include the following:
1. Esmolol: It is an ultra-short acting beta blocker. Side effects include decreased contractility,
bradyarrhythmias, and bronchoconstriction, and the possibility of hypotension:
a. 50-100 mcg/kg IV over 1 minute repeated up to 5 times. Then, CRl 50-200 mcg/kg/min.
2. Amiodarone: It is a Class ll antiarrhythmic commonly used to treat both ventricular and
v. Monitoring:
1. ECG:
b. Response:
i. Complete resolution of trauma-associated cardiac arrhythmias is uncommon.
 ii. Rate control for ventricular tachyarrhythmias and elimination of life-threatening arrhythmias is the
focus of therapy:
1. Overall heart rate < 140 bpm (dog)
2. No evidence of R on T
2.  Monitoring for side effects associated with anti-arrhythmic therapy should be performed and
medications adjusted as needed.
 3. Additional monitoring as is appropriate for concurrent injuries.
vi. Prognosis:
1. Most trauma-associated cardiac arrhythmias resolve over 3-5 days.
2. Ultimate prognosis is dictated by the severity of concurrent injuries.
b. Traumatic pericardial effusion:

1. Clinical signs:
a. No specific clinical signs of acute pericardial effusion will be evident immediately after trauma.
b. Extreme lethargy and collapse may be identified.
2. Physical examination:

may vary with the phase of respiration (pulsus paradoxus) .
b. Muffled heart sounds may be identified.
tamponade will result in distended jugular veins +t/- jugular pulses.
d. Longer-standing cardiac tamponade (hours to days) will result in abdominal effusion.
ii. Diagnostics:
1. Because pericardial effusion is an uncommon acute manifestation of trauma, it is not often suspected
solely based on physical examination.
2. Echocardiography:
a. Echocardiography from the right cardiac notch will definitively identify the presence of pericardia

a. Tracheoscopy will facilitate the diagnosis of tracheal avulsion if survey radiography is not definitive. In
 addition, tracheoscopy may also facilitate intubation of the distal tracheal segment; see Therapeutics.
iv. Therapeutics:
1. Anesthetic considerations and surgical considerations:
a. Dogs and cats with tracheal avulsion are very high-risk anesthetic candidates.
b. Most often, only the proximal tracheal segment can be intubated initially. Attempts to blindly intubate
 reflections that are maintaining the airway), pneumothorax, and acute decompensation and death.

ii. Endoscopy-aided intubation of the distal segment was not successful in one series of cats due to the
degree of stenosis or acute trauma to the proximal segment (white and Burton, 2000).
ili. Rapid thoracotomy and intubation of the distal tracheal segment via the surgical site will allow for
ventilatory support while the tracheal anastamosis is performed.
 2. Tracheal resection and anastamosis is the treatment of choice for dogs and cats with tracheal avulsion.
v. Monitoring:
1. Monitoring of animals with tracheal avulsion is directed primarily toward the respiratory system.
 Indices of oxygenation along with respiratory rate and effort should be frequently assessed.

and Burton, 2000). However, anesthesia and surgery are both technically challenging.
b. Mainstem bronchial rupture:
i. Definition and pathophysiology:
1. Left mainstem bronchial rupture has been reported in a cat (white and Oakley, 2001).
2. Management is consistent with the management of animals with tracheal avulsion.
c. Pneumomediastinum:
i. Definition and pathophysiology:
1. Pneumomediastinum is the accumulation of air in the mediastinal space.
2. Pneumomediastinum may occur secondary to a variety of injuries:
a. Tracheal rupture.
b. Tracheal avulsion.
c. Other large airway rupture/avulsion.
d. Esophageal disruption.
e. Cervical lacerations. The subcutaneous space in the neck is continuous with the mediastinum.
f. Blebs. Air from blebs can track back into the mediastinum.
g. Pneumomediastinum is often seen concurrently with subcutaneous emphysema.
4. Tension pneumomediastinum is possible.
ii. Clinical signs/physical examination and oxygenation assessment:
1. Most clinical signs, physical examination findings, and hypoxemia are attributed to the underlying
cause of pneumomediastinum and concurrent injuries.
Ill. Diagnostics:
a. Pneumomediastinum gives negative contrast to the mediastinal space allowing for direct visualization
of the aortic arch, brachycephalic trunk, tracheal and esophageal walls.
2. Radiographic evidence of pneumomediastinum should prompt a search for the underlying cause of
pneumomediastinum:
b. Tracheoscopy to evaluate for tracheal and mainstem bronchial injury.
c. Esophagoscopy to evaluate for esophageal injury.
iv. Therapeutics:
Treatment should be directed toward the underlying disease process.
v. Monitoring:
1. Pneumomediastinum does not require specific monitoring but can progress to pneumothorax.
pneumothorax.
vi. Prognosis:
1. Prognosis for patients with pneumomediastinum is best dictated by the underlying disease process.

TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY
Rebecca S. Syring
a. The overall incidence of head trauma is not well studied in veterinary patients. However, in a large multi-
center study of 191 cats and 1099 dogs with traumatic injuries, 42% of cats and 26% of dogs exhibited clinical
signs of head trauma (Kolata, 1980).
b. At a large urban veterinary teaching hospital emergency room, the medical records of 290 dogs and cats

recommendations of head injured dogs and cats has largely been extrapolated from information reported in
experimental studies and human medicine:
i. In a study of 52 dogs and 70 cats with clinical signs of head trauma, 73% of dogs and 74% of cats survived
to hospital discharge (Syring et al., 2001). Several animals in this study were discharged prior to resolution
of signs and subsequently lost to follow-up; therefore, these numbers may overestimate a good outcome

 ill. Common causes of penetrating trauma include bite wounds, gunshot wounds, and miscellaneous

2.PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY
a. Primary injury:
i. The injury incurred at the time of trauma as a result of the mechanical forces imparted to the brain.

intraparenchymal hemorrhage in more severe cases.
c.Early posttraumatic coma is often associated with severe diffuse axonal injury, whereas more focal
injuries often result in a progressive deterioration in neurological status. Alterations in mentation despite
normal imaging studies should increase the suspicion for diffuse axonal injury.
4. Hematomas:
i. Epidural hematomas arise between the skull and the dura mater-epidural hemorrhage usually occurs
as a result of disruption of the meningeal vasculature (Figure 7.-1).

unless there is a skull fracture that can be surgically decompressed or a hematoma that can be surgically

ili. Cerebral oxygen delivery is dependent upon adequate cerebral blood flow (CBF) and adequate oxygen
 content in the circulation:
1. Maintenance of CBF:
a. CBF is a product of cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and cerebral vascular resistance.
b. In health, autoregulation of CBF ensures that blood flow to the brain is maintained over a wide range

injury have impaired pressure autoregulation of blood flow (Bouma et al., 1992).
c. Cere bral perfusion pressure (CPP):
i. In health CPP = MAP - RAP, where MAP represents the mean arterial pressure and RAP represents the
right atrial pressure.
ii. When intracranial pressure is elevated above RAP, the following equation should be utilized: CPP =
MAP - ICP.
ili. Normal intracranial pressure is 5-12 mm Hg in cats and dogs.
nutrient delivery to the brain. while a CPP of 70 mm Hg is optimal, overly aggressive attempts to further
acute lung injury (Brain Trauma Foundation, 2007).
v. Since intracranial pressure is not measured in most veterinary patients, a normal MAP should be
strived for in order to optimize CPP.
2. Maintenance of adequate oxygen content is dependent upon hemoglobin saturation with oxygen
(SaOz), hemoglobin concentration, and dissolved oxygen concentration (PaOz) (see Chapter 3: Shock in
the Trauma Patient).

c. Physical examination of the central nervous system:
i. A limited neurological examination focusing upon level of consciousness, posture, pupil size, symmetry,
sta bilization.
ii. Level of consciousness:
1. Alterations in the level of consciousness to an animal following trauma may be indicative of injury to
other reasons for shock, may also alter the level of consciousness. Therefore, level of consciousness
should be reassessed following volume resuscitation and resolution of shock (see Chapter 3: Shock in the
Trauma Patient).
2. Classifying level of consciousness:
a. Alert: a normal level of mentation
b. Depressed: mentation is diminished from normal but aware of things occurring in the environment.

b. Decerebrate posturing indicates a rostral brainstem lesion or any brain lesion resulting in brainstem
compression and may be seen with significant intracranial hypertension and herniation. It is associated
with a guarded prognosis.
c. It is important to differentiate decerebrate posturing from the Schiff-Sherrington posture:
i. Schiff-Sherrington posture is associated with T3-L3 spinal lesions.
ii. These animals will exhibit hypertonic front limbs and flaccid paresis of the hind limbs.
3. Decerebellate rigidity/posturing:
a. It is characterized by extensor rigidity of the front limbs, opisthotonus, and the presence flexed
hindlimbs at the coxofemoral joint with normal tone (Figure 7.-2)
FLGURE7.-2
This dog demonstrates decerebellate posturing. Note the extended head and neck, increased tone in the front
legs, and flexion of the hindlimbs at the coxofemoral joints. This dog was alert and aware of his surroundings
b. These animals tend to be responsive unless concurrent injury is present elsewhere in the brain, as the
cerebellum is not required for maintenance of consciousness.
c. Decerebellate posturing is associated with cerebellar disease, such as cerebellar herniation as seen
with intracranial hypertension.
iv. Pupils:
1. Pupil symmetry:
a. Differences in resting pupil size is termed anisocoria.
b. An attempt should be made to discern which pupil is abnormal (i.e., is one pupil too dilated or is the
other pupil too constricted). This will help to ascertain the reason for anisocoria.
2. Pupil size:
a. Miosis:

ii. Miosis also occurs with Horner's syndrome originating from extracranial injuries, such as a cervical

elevation of the third eyelid will often be present to help differentiate miosis related to Horner's
syndrome from other injuries. In addition, neck pain and/or ataxia, paresis, or paralysis may be noted in
the hindlimbs or all four limbs with cervical lesions, while decreased sensation and/or ability to move one
front limb may be noted with brachial plexus injuries (see Chapter 9: Traumatic Spinal Injury and Chapter
8: Trauma-Associated Peripheral Nerve Injury).
ili.  Miosis also occurs with traumatic uveitis. Other signs of traumatic uveitis include blepharospasm,
aqueous flare, and possibly hyphema in the anterior chamber (see Chapter 15: Trauma-Associated Ocular
Injury).
 iv. Superficial corneal abrasions and ulcers may cause ciliary spasm resulting in miosis as well.
b. Midrange:
i. while seemingly normal, midrange pupils should always be assessed for responsiveness to light.
il. A midrange pupil that responds appropriately to light is normal.

1. In this scenario, altered mentation should be noted, because of the close proximity to the reticular

2. If present without alterations in mentation, other reasons for a dilated unresponsive pupil should be
considered, such as blindness secondary to retinal damage, cataracts, etc.

ili. Unilateral oculomotor nerve damage:
1. The direct PLR is absent when light is shown in the affected eye but a normal indirect PLR is present.
 2. The direct PLR will be present in the unaffected eye but the indirect PLR will be absent.
4. When direct ocular injury or preexisting ocular pathology can be excluded (see Chapter 15: Trauma-
Associated Ocular Injury), interpretation of pupil size and reactivity can provide information regarding
prognosis following head trauma:

vi. Facial/oral fractures (see Chapter 16: Trauma-Associated Musculoskeletal Injury to the Head).
viil. Bradycardia and hypertension (The Cushing's Reflex):
1. This response is seen with intracranial hypertension that is causing decreased perfusion to the
vasomotor center.
2. As intracranial pressure increases, blood flow is impaired to the brain.
3. The vasomotor center of the brain senses decreased perfusion and emits a sympathetic response.
4. This catecholamine surge results in massive peripheral vasoconstriction to improve cerebral perfusion.
 5. Massive vasoconstriction results in hypertension.
7. Treatment of hypertension with concurrent bradycardia in a head injured animal should focus on
agents to increase heart rate or lower blood pressure.
4.DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING

5.TREATMENT OF TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY
a. Extracranial stabilization:
i. Oxygenation:
1. Oxygen supplementation should be considered for all patients with traumatic brain injury until you can
prove that it is not needed, because of the risk for perpetuation of secondary brain injury when
hypoxemia is present:

when necessary. Be aware that nasal insufflation should be avoided if it causes irritation and sneezing, as
this may increase intracranial pressure.
2. Oxygen supplementation is absolutely required in any animal with a PaOz < 60 mm Hg, or an SpOz <
92%.
%96 < zods ue 1o '9h wu 0g < zoed uie1uieu oi ag pinoys uogeuawalddns uaxo jo sieo ewdo 'e
if. Ventilation:
1. Maintenance of ventilation is important in animals with head injury:
a. Hypoventilation will increase PacOz, which causes a respiratory acidosis.
b. In response to changes in pH, central chemoreceptors in the brain will alter cerebral blood flow, a
process known as chemical autoregulation:
i.  In the presence of acute acidosis (hypoventilation), cerebral vasculature will dilate and increase
cerebral blood flow. This could increase intracranial pressure or result in cere bral hyperemia
ii. In the presence of acute alkalosis (hyperventilation), cerebral vasculature will constrict and decrease
cerebral blood flow. This could decrease intracranial pressure or worsen cere bral ischemia.
2. While monitoring of physical examination parameters such as respiratory rate and depth of thoracic
excursions may aid in detection of hypoventilation, measurement of arterial PcOz is the optimal method
to monitor ventilation.
  t sxa o  s     a    o  
methods to increase ventilation should be considered:
following: thoracic pain (i.e., rib fractures), severe pulmonary (i.e., pulmonary contusion), pleural space
disease, excessive sedation, or upper airway obstruction (i.e., swelling, hemorrhage, etc.).
b. Correcting the underlying cause may improve ventilation:
i. Analgesics should be given if thoracic pain is suspected.
ii. Thoracocentesis could be considered if pneumothorax or pleural effusion is suspected.
ii. Reversal of sedatives may be needed.

saline solutions.
d. Colloids:
i. Artificial colloids, such as hydroxyethyl starches or dextran-70, can be considered in the head-injured
patient for more rapid resuscitation (because of the smaller volume required for resuscitation), prolonged
that artificial colloids are superior to isotonic crystalloids in head injured patients (see Chapter 3: Shock in
the Trauma Patient).
ii. Human serum albumin:

iv. Blood pressure:
 1. Systolic blood pressure should be maintained above 90 mm Hg:
a. Systolic blood pressure can be monitored directly with an indwelling arterial catheter or noninvasively
b. It is commonly believed that the blood pressure obtained via Doppler ultrasonography represents the
systolic blood pressure.
c. If blood pressure cannot be maintained above 90 mm Hg despite repletion of volume deficits with
intravenous fluids, then vasopressors (i.e., dopamine, norepinephrine, etc.) should be considered. It is
absolutely critical that adequate volume expansion be ensured prior to pressor administration.
b. Intracranial stabilization:
i. Therapies to decrease intracranial pressure:
1. Decrease brain volume:
a. Osmotic agents:
Mannitol:
jo yog 'sanip souso ue se pue nuase ssonoauu e se 'uooe jo ssjueuoau uieu omi su louu t
which are beneficial to patients with traumatic brain injury:
a. Immediately after intravenous administration, mannitol increases plasma volume, which reduces the
hematocrit and blood viscosity. Decreased viscosity improves cerebral blood flow and oxygen delivery.
This effect is short-lived and noted within the first few minutes of administration.
the intravascular space from cells and interstitium as a result of its hyperosmolarity. This helps to reduce
cerebral edema.
2. The osmotic effect of mannitol is proportional to the dose administered, and it is thought that higher
doses cause a greater effect:
a. The recommended dose of mannitol ranges from 0.25 to 1.4 g/kg given as an intravenous infusion over
15-20 minutes. The author prefers doses of 1.0-1.4 g/kg but will use lower doses when concerns for
volume depletion are present. An effect should be noted within 20-40 minutes of ad ministration.
posture, or return of PLR or pupil size toward normal. Lack of a response or a negative response to
mannitol should preclude its continued use.
c. Mannitol should not be given as a constant rate infusion over several hours nor should it be diluted, as

tissue.
d. Mannitol, in concentrations above 15%, readily crystallizes. Therefore, the bottle should be closely
inspected prior to administration and an in-line 0.22 micron filter can be used to reduce the risk for
infusion of crystals. Keeping bottles warmed (35-40°C) in a water bath or incubator may help to prevent
crystal formation.
e. Mannitol is also purported to have free radical scavenging properties, which may help to reduce

which causes free water loss:
a. Mannitol should be given on an "as needed" basis, rather than being written as an automatic
treatment order. No more than 3 doses of mannitol should be given in a 24-hour period. In the author's

output should be performed in order to keep up with ongoing losses
to assess for hypernatremia and the need for alteration in fluid therapy.
4. Mannitol should be used with caution in animals with concurrent hypovolemia, as it will cause an
osmotic diuresis, which will worsen hypovolemia and therefore compromise cerebral perfusion pressure

lower intracranial pressure before the animal is fully volume expanded, then hypertonic saline should be
considered.
5. Some people advocate the use of furosemide (0.5-1.0 mg/kg IV) prior to mannitol. The reasoning
behind this recommendation is that furosemide can induce a transient vasodilation, which may blunt the
initial rise in ICP due to intravascular volume expansion that mannitol may cause prior to the onset of an
said, the risk for volume depletion is greater when furosemide is administered with mannitol and
therefore its routine use is not recommended.
6. The potential risk that mannitol may increase intracranial bleeding probably does NOT outweigh global
benefit to the brain.
Hypertonic saline (7.0-7.8%):

cerebral edema.
2. A dose of 3-5 ml/kg has been recommended for use in dogs (2-3 ml/kg for cats) for volume

2003).
b. Corticosteroids:
head-injured animals. Therefore, one must look to human clinical medicine for guidelines.

Trauma Foundation, 2007).
ill. A prospective clinical trial involving over 10,oo0 human patients with moderate to severe traumatic

4. Decreased wound healing
5. Immunosuppression
c. Others:
i. 21-Aminosteroids (Lazaroids; i.e., Tirilazad mesylate):
1. Initial experimental evidence demonstrated that 21-aminosteroids were more effective than
glucocorticoids in traumatic brain injury and that they did not possess the same untoward side effects of
glucocorticoids (Hall, 1992).
2. Two human clinical studies in head trauma failed to show a beneficial effect on outcome (Kassal, 1996;
Marshall et al., 1998).

for their free-radical scavenging properties. There are no clinical studies, in animals or people, to support
or refute their use.
2. Decrease brain blood volume:

i. Elevation of the head and neck 15-30° above the posterior half of the body can be used to facilitate
venous outflow from the brain. This may help to decrease blood volume in the brain and thereby
decrease intracranial pressure.
ii. Care should be taken to avoid kinking of the neck, which may occlude the jugular vein, not only
apadwi uen siun se 'papuawwonau nou s! oe ueun lateaig alsue ue oi yoau pue peay aut jo uoeaal3 !!
iv. Elevation of the head and neck should be performed after volume resuscitation in hypovolemic
patients.
b. Hyperventilation:
i. Mild hyperventilation (PaCOz 30-35 mm Hg) can be used to temporarily lower intracranial pressure. As
PaCOz decreases, the resulting alkalosis will cause vasoconstriction of the cerebral vasculature, which
may help to reduce intracranial pressure through a decrease in the brain blood volume.
ii. Excessive or prolonged hyperventilation to PaCOz concentrations below 30 mm Hg may be harmful, as
vasoconstriction may potentiate cerebral ischemia and worsen secondary injury:

noted during this time frame. (Brain Trauma Foundation, 2007)
i. The effect that hyperventilation has on the cerebral vasculature is transient in nature. Once the pH
change has been buffered in the brain, the effect will be negated. Therefore, the therapeutic use of

iil. Therapies to decrease cerebral metabolic rate (CMR):
1. Seizure prophylaxis:
a. Seizure activity increases cerebral metabolic rate directly by neuronal activation and indirectly by
increasing body temperature.
b. Early posttraumatic seizures (within 7 days of injury) have been noted in 4-25% of people following
head injury (Tempkin et al., 1991) prompting the frequent use prophylactic anticonvulsant therapy
c. While prophylactic anticonvulsant therapy is not recommended in dogs and cats, if seizures are noted
i. Valium or midazolam (0.25-0.50 mg/kg IV) can be used to stop any ongoing seizure activity.

mg/kg of Phenobarbital IV every 30 minutes to 2 hours for a total of 4 doses to achieve therapeutic
concentrations within 2-8 hours. During loading, any break through seizures should be treated with
valium or midazolam.
2. Sedation and analgesia:
anssaid leueneus ui saseaous n anguon Aeu pue anead uan apog
thought that the beneficial effects of sedation outweigh this fact.
c. Care should be taken to avoid drugs that may cause refractory hypotension (i.e., acepromazine) or may
increase cerebral metabolic rate (i.e., ketamine).
d. While concern exists that opioids cause respiratory depression, which could result in hypercarbia and
increased intracranial pressure, dogs and cats are much less sensitive to the respiratory depressant
sisuoseiue/isiuose ieied jo asn aul 'ioaa on paien aa pinous asop aue pue sualed ewne-peay
(i.e., Butorphanol or Buprenorphine) should be used with caution as these agents are more difficult to
reverse with naloxone should respiratory depression be a problem.
e. See Chapter 5: Analgesia and Anesthesia for the Trauma Patient.
3. Body temperature:
avoid hyperthermia.
c. while controlled hypothermia has not been investigated in veterinary patients, the author suggests
that aggressive rewarming (i.e., forced air or circulating water blankets) should be avoided in animals who
 are cardiovascularly stable for risk that hyperthermia may result if the rewarming device is not removed
in a timely fashion.
6.MONITORING THE PATIENT WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY
a. Physical parameters:
i. Serial neurological examination:
1. Cranial nerve examination (see Iable 7.-1)

2. An epidural water-filled monitoring system has been validated in normal cats. This system is
affordable, making the risk for damage to equipment negligible (Dewey et al., 1997).
vi. while intracranial pressure monitoring is not routine in veterinary medicine, its measurement is
feasible in head injured animals when a high level of care can be provided.
d. Jugular vein oxygen saturation:
i. Jugular venous bulb oxygen saturation provides an indirect measure of global cere bral oxygen utilization:
decreased venous oxygen saturation in blood returning from the brain.

oxygen content:
vasospasm, hypovolemia, and hyperventilation.
b. Decreased arterial oxygen content can result from anemia, hypoxemia, and dyshemoglobinemias.
agents, such as ketamine.
ii. Measurement of jugular venous bulb oxygen saturation:
1. In people, the catheter should be inserted into the internal jugular vein in a cephalad direction to a
level just below the base of the skull. When inserted into the internal jugular vein in people, the blood
obtained from consists almost exclusively (97%) of venous return from the brain, with small contribution
from the skull, cranial musculature, and meninges:

c. Placement of such a monitoring device may be contraindicated in patients with increased intracranial
pressure, as even transient occlusion of the jugular vein could result in rapid elevations in intracranial
pressure, which could be fatal.
2. All air should be quickly expelled from the sampling syringe and the syringe should be capped to the
increase the oxygen saturation within the sample.
3. Samples should be processed within 10 minutes of collection at room temperature or can be processed
within 4 hours if maintained on ice.
ill. Interpretation of jugular venous bulb oxygen saturation:
1. Normal jugular venous oxygen saturation is 55-75%—this is lower than is considered normal for
systemic mixed venous oxygen saturation.
2. This measurement has a high specificity (i.e., when this value is low you can be assured that cerebral
ischemia is present) but it is not very sensitive (i.e., focal regions of cerebral ischemia may be present
despite normal values).
 3. Jugular venous oxygen saturations below 50% warrant institution of therapies to increase oxygen
supply (by increasing cerebral blood flow or arterial oxygen content) or decreasing cerebral metabolic
rate (such as sedation, seizure management, or controlled hypothermia).
4. In the absence of intracranial pressure monitoring in veterinary medicine, monitoring of jugular venous
oxygen saturation may provide a relatively noninvasive technique to assess the efficacy of various
cerebral oxygen balance.
e. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography:
i. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography provides a noninvasive measure of cerebral blood flow velocity

3. A small retrospective study of 38 dogs with head injury found a linear association between the
probability of survival. A Modified Glasgow Coma Scale score of 8 at admission was associated with 50%
probability of survival at 48 hours. In this study, gender, body weight, and the presence of skull fractures
were not useful in predicting outcome (Platt et al., 2001).
b. Biochemical disturbances:
outcome in adult and pediatric head trauma. Hyperglycemia has been documented in cats and dogs
following head trauma, and the degree of hyperglycemia on hospital admission was associated with
severity of neurological injury (Syring et al., 2001).

intumescence or pelvic limb nerves.
b. The peripheral nerve has three layers of supporting connective tissue. Individual axons are surrounded by
the endoneurium. Bundles, or fascicles, of nerve fibers are then surrounded by the perineurium. The entire
nerve is encased in the epineurium.

canal ablation and ventral bulla osteotomy (Sharp, 1990; Bacon et al., 2003).
2. With blunt head trauma, fracture of the petrosal temporal bone can affect the vestibulocochlear nerve
and cause peripheral or central vestibular signs (ataxia, head tilt, nystagmus) and ipsilateral facial nerve
paralysis (see Chapter 21: Trauma-Associated Aural Injury and Chapter 7: Traumatic Brain Injury).

b. Brachial plexus avulsion:
a common sequela to vehicular trauma, when the thoracic limb is sheared away from the body. Avulsion of
the nerve roots is common, potentially because there is less surrounding connective tissue over the nerve
roots.
 ii. The ventral nerve roots, and the nerve roots of C8 and T1, are most commonly affected.
ili. For clinical signs to be apparent, two or more adjacent nerve roots must be affected.
iv. Complete brachial plexus avulsion:
1. All of the roots from the spinal cord segments C6 to T2 are affected.
2. The limb is paralyzed and flaccid. The withdrawal reflex, extensor carpi radialis reflex, and biceps reflex
cannot be elicited.
3. The presence or absence of sensation is the most important prognostic indicator.
v. Caudal brachial plexus avulsion:
1. The nerve roots from the C6 and C7 spinal cord are not affected, and shoulder and elbow function may
be spared.
2. These animals will often hold the limb off of the ground and flex the elbow, and sensation may be lost
over craniolateral antebrachium and dorsum of the paw due to damage of the nerve responsible for this 
zone of cutaneous sensation. (Figure 8.-4)

bulla to the eye (Eigure 8.-1).
4. These animals may also have loss of the ipsilateral cutaneous trunci reflex:
a. The lateral thoracic nerve exits the spinal cord at the C7-T1 spinal cord segments.
b. Normally, this nerve provides the efferent response (bilateral contraction of the cutaneous trunc)
muscle) to the afferent local stimulus of pinching the skin over the ipsilateral thoracic and cranial lumbar
spine.
c. Because the contralateral lateral thoracic nerve is intact in cases of caudal brachial plexus avulsion,
pinching the skin over the thoracolumbar spine on the affected side will still yield the appropriate
contralateral response.
vi. Cranial brachial plexus avulsions are uncommon, but carry a better prognosis as these animals retain
the ability to bear weight on the limb. There may be ipsilateral paralysis of the diaphragm with
involvement of the C5, 6, and 7 nerve roots.
vii. Diagnostic testing for suspected brachial plexus avulsion includes a thorough neurological examination,

2. Electrodiagnostic examination (electromyography, motor evoked responses [H wave, F wave, magnetic
Electromyography and nerve conduction studies should be delayed at least 5-7 days from the onset of
the clinical signs to allow for abnormalities to become apparent.
vili. Treatment for brachial plexus avulsion includes physical therapy (passive range of motion exercises
and massage, to prevent muscle contracture) and protecting the limb from self-mutilation and from
dragging on the ground. Most cases of neuropraxia will improve within 4-6 weeks. If there is no
improvement within 4-6 months, then it is not likely that there will be return of function, and amputation
may be necessary.
ix. Prognosis is guarded. Recovery rates to an acceptable level of function range from 20 to 28% in the
veterinary literature (Dewey, 2003; Shores, 1993; Wheeler et al., 1986).

c. The innervation to the urinary bladder is complex (Figure &.-6):
i. Parasympathetic innervation is provided via the pelvic nerve, which stimulates cholinergic (muscarinic)
rece ptors in the urinary bladder and causes detrusor muscle contraction in the bladder wall.
ii. Sympathetic innervation is provided via the hypogastric nerve, which activates β adrenergic receptors in

1.GENERAL APPROACH TO THE SPINAL TRAUMA PATIENT
a. Spinal trauma can result in a wide range of injuries, including spinal cord contusion, vertebral fracture or
luxation, and traumatic intervertebral disk herniation. Common causes of spinal trauma include motor vehicle
accidents, falls, projectile injuries, trauma from falling objects, and bite wounds.
c. Once life-threatening injuries to the other major body systems have been identified and addressed,
pinous shgan piloloinau seui patou aa pinous i 'uayapun ag uen ansui po euids algissod sog uoeniaa
i. An initial, brief evaluation of spinal cord function should include testing for the presence of superficial
and deep pain sensation in all 4 limbs as well as presence of segmental reflexes. The results of this survey
yield an initial neuroanatomic localization of the injury and assessment of injury severity.
ii. Gentle palpation of the spine can yield evidence of spinal instability, malalignment, crepitus or pain, but
evidence of spinal cord dysfunction should be immobilized to reduce the risk of further traumatic injury to

spine and wide enough to support all 4 limbs. Minimally, 2@@ white tape or Elasticon should be used to
secure the patient to the board over the shoulder and over the hip. See Figure 9.-1 for an example.
Additional tape should be used if needed.
ili. Imaging, potentially including radiography, myelography, computed tomography, and/or magnetic
resonance imaging should be employed for definitive diagnosis.
d. Initial management of the spinal trauma patient should include immobilization of unstable fractures as

ii. There are a number of different types of primary injury, including spinal luxation and vertebral fracture,
1. The types and severity of spinal luxations and vertebral fractures are dependent upon the structures
affected. Athree compartment model of the vertebra has been proposed to describe the stability of these
types of injuries (see Figure 9.-2):
 a. The dorsal compartment includes the articular processes, laminae, pedicles, and spinous processes.
b. The middle compartment contains the dorsal longitudinal ligament, the dorsal aspect of the vertebral
body, and the dorsal portion of the annulus fibrosis.

2. Damage to any two of the three compartments results in spinal instability.
3. In addition, the type and severity of the force applied to the spine will determine the type of fracture
 or luxation that results:
a. Vertebral lamina, facet, or pedicle fractures result from extension of the spine. Because disruption of
the annulus is common, these fractures are unstable upon extension of the spine, but remain stable in
flexion.
generally unstable. In addition, bone fragments may be found within the vertebral canal, causing
compression of the spinal cord.
uncommon with vertebral compression fractures because of the high likelihood of maintenance of dorsal
ligamentous stabilizing structures.
d. Spinal luxation in the absence of vertebral fracture results from flexion with or without rotation of the
spine. The instability resulting from these types of injuries is due to compromise of both the dorsal and
ventral ligamentous structures.
e. Spinal luxation in the presence of vertebral fracture results from rotational forces with or without the
presence of flexion forces. These injuries are also unstable due to the compromise of dorsal and ventra
ligame ntous structures.
4. Traumatic intervertebral disk herniation typically occurs in dogs with Hansen's Type I intervertebral

intervertebral disk, predisposing them to traumatic herniation.
5. Spinal cord contusion (hemorrhage into the spinal cord parenchyma) is rarely reported in the
veterinary literature as an independent finding after spinal trauma. However, contusions likely commonly
also develop secondary to traumatic motion of the spinal cord within the vertebral canal, resulting in coup
 and contrecoup lesions, similar to cerebral contusions that develop after head trauma.

reported secondary to trauma in humans, they are rare. Several case reports in the veterinary literature
describe the development of epidural hematomas secondary to intervertebral disk herniation, but there
are no published reports of these types of injury secondary to trauma.

perpetuation of neuronal injury.
4. Extracellular concentrations of excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate and aspartate are
astrocytes. These excitatory neurotransmitters activate a number of neuronal rece ptors, causing influx of
sodium and calcium, as well as causing cellular swelling.

2.DIaGNOSTIC EVALUATION
a. Neurologic examination:
i. An initial brief neurologic examination should be done to obtain a neuroanatomical diagnosis and
determine if an unstable fracture is present:
the presence of an unstable injury has been ruled out, all patients should be treated as if the spine is
unstable.
2. The initial neurologic examination should consist of the following:
a. Cranial nerve examination and evaluation of mentation.
b. Presence of segmental reflexes in all four limbs.
c. Presence of superficial pain sensation in all four limbs.
d. If superficial pain sensation is absent, presence of deep pain sensation in affected limbs.
e. Gentle spinal palpation to identify areas of instability, pain, crepitus, or malalignment.
f. Panniculus reflex to provide additional localizing information in animals with thoracolumbar trauma.

i. Evaluation of the ability of the animal to ambulate.
ii. Presence of voluntary motor function in all four limbs.

3.  Radiography has been shown to have relatively low sensitivity for vertebral fractures (72%) and
subluxations (77.5%) in canine trauma patients, as well as low negative predictive values for the presence
of fracture fragments within the vertebral canal (51%). This suggests that spinal radiographs alone should
not be used to definitively rule out the presence of spinal luxation or vertebral fracture.

3. Nonsurgical management of vertebral fracture and spinal luxation involves external coaptation and
plaster, metal rods, or other materials that can be fashioned to conform to the patient's body shape (see
Figures 9.-4 and 9.-5). Immobilization of the entire spine must be achieved. The splint is held in place
using bandage material, taking care to provide the required spinal stability without compromising the
ability of the patient to ventilate. The bandage should be evaluated daily for evidence of soiling,

suggests that the free radical scavenging property of Mpss is the most important protective effect in
patients with spinal cord injury. Although the anti-inflammatory effects of other common corticosteroids

do not possess the free-radical scavenging of MPss and are unlikely to have any significant
neuroprotective effect.

URINARY TRACT TRAUMA
Merilee F. Costello
1.INTRODUCTION
a. Trauma to the urinary tract is an important rule-out in any trauma patient.
 b. Common causes of trauma to the urinary tract include the following:
i. Blunt trauma:
1. In animals with blunt pelvic trauma, 39% are reported to have concurrent trauma to the urinary tract
(Mathews, 2004).
ii. Penetrating trauma including gunshot wounds, bite wounds, or other penetrating objects.
ili. latrogenic trauma:
 1. Urethral catheterization when relieving urethral obstruction.
 2. Surgical trauma:
a. Cryptorchid orchiectomy
b. Surgery to remove urethral calculi
c. Inadvertent ligation and transaction of the ureters during ovariohysterectomy
c. Trauma to the urinary tract often goes undetected:
i. Incidence of trauma to the urinary tract that is not identified in dogs and cats has been reported as
20-50% and 15.4%, respectively (Aumann et al., (1998)):
1. In these studies, in some cases, the diagnosis was not made until clinical signs of azotemia and
2. In cats, a palpable bladder was noted in 20% of the cats with a ruptured bladder.

b. Uroperitoneum occurs secondary to traumatic injury and subsequent urine leakage from the urethra,
bladder, ureter, or kidney:
i. Other etiologies of uroperitoneum include the following:
1. Bladder rupture due to neoplastic infiltration, most commonly transitional cell carcinoma
 2. Urethral calculi and urinary obstruction
 3. Traumatic urethral catheterization
4. Cystocentesis
c. Pathophysiology:
are reabsorbed into the bloodstream, resulting in severe azotemia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis
respectively:
1. The degree of reabsorption is partly dependent on the molecular size:
a. Urea is a small molecule that rapidly equilibrates with the bloodstream, resulting in little difference in
the BUN levels between the blood and the abdominal effusion.
b. Creatinine is a large molecule and does not diffuse as readily, thus, uroperitoneum will result in a

b. Hematuria can also occur secondary to damage to the bladder mucosa and kidneys without being
 associated with rupture and urine leakage.
c. Significant urinary trauma can also occur without concomitant hematuria, so its absence does not rule
out injury.

i. Clinicopathologic abnormalities:
Analysis/Electrolytes/BUN/CREA/Lactate is a very useful tool to aid in the early identification of many of
the clinicopathologic manifestations of uroperitoneum:
a. PCV/TS:
i. Hemoconcentraiton may result secondary to dehydration associated with decreased fuid intake, fluid

b. Venous or arterial blood gas analysis:
ii. Metabolic acidosis secondary to increased production of lactate and hydrogen ion due to concurrent
injuries is not unexpected in animals with uroperitoneum and abdominal trauma.
iil. Respiratory alkalosis may be noted due to pain, stress, or concurrent thoracic injuries.
iv. Mixed disturbances are expected.
c. Electrolytes:
i. Common electrolyte disturbances in dogs and cats with uroperitoneum include hyperkalemia,
hyponatremia, and hypochloremia:

1. Abdominal fluid accumulation is expected in animals with uroperitoneum. Abdominal fluid may be
Suspected based on physical examination, survey radiography results (see below), or FAST Scan (see
below). A suspicion of abdominal effusion should prompt routine (blind) or ultrasound-guided
abdominocentesis.
2. Abdominal fluid analysis is an excellent screening test for the presence of uroperitoneum through the
comparison of abdominal fluid creatinine and potassium to blood creatinine and potassium respectively:

iv. Diagnostic imaging:
1. Various diagnostic imaging techniques are useful in the evaluation of the traumatized patient.
2. Diagnostic imaging is critical prior to surgical intervention in dogs and cats with uroperitoneum to
better localize the source of the uroperitoneum.
3. Survey radiography:
a. Important to evaluate for concurrent fractures commonly associated with urinary trauma:
ii. Only 0.5% of cats with pelvic injuries have urinary tract injury (Aumann et al., (1998)).
b. Changes seen on survey radiographs may be supportive of damage to the urinary system, but they
rarely provide a definitive diagnosis:
i. May show loss of abdominal detail secondary to peritoneal effusion.
ii. Abdominocentesis is indicated when there is a loss of abdominal detail noted radiographically.

5. Abdominal ultrasound:
a. Abdominal ultrasound may show perirenal or retroperitoneal fluid in cases of renal laceration, ureteral
disruption, or abdominal effusion in cases of bladder rupture.
b. Focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAsT) is a method of evaluating dogs that have
undergone trauma to evaluate for injuries resulting in fluid accumulation within the peritoneal and
retroperitoneal spaces. Using ultrasound, transverse and longitudinal views are examined in each of these
four locations (Boysen et al., (2004)):
i. Just caudal to the xiphoid process
ii. The midline over the bladder;
iv. Over the most gravity-dependent area of the left flank
c. Abdominocentesis is indicated when fluid is suspected based on FAST scan.
i. The initial management must be aimed at treating any life-threatening injuries:
Chapter 3: Shock in the Trauma Patient).
3. Neurologic status should be addressed, and head or spinal trauma treated as needed (see Chapter 9:
Traumatic Spinal Injury).
4. Management of life-threatening hyperkalemia is critical to the initial stabilization of dogs and cats with
urope ritoneum:
a. Intravenous volume expansion (see below):
i. Rapid intravascular volume expansion will result in rapid (within minutes) dilution of blood potassium
concentration. Its effects can be evident immediately after ad ministration.
ii. 0.9% NaCl lacks potassium and is very appropriate to utilize in this situation. LRS or Normosol-R are
also reasonable crystalloid volume expanding fluids.
b. Calcium gluconate:
manifestations of hyperkalemia.
ii. Calcium gluconate decreases the threshold potential (making it less negative); thus restoring a
ii. Calcium gluconate has a very rapid onset of action. Increases in heart rate and ECG conformation are
evident within minutes of ad ministration.
iv. 0.5 ml/kg of 10% calcium gluconate is administered intravenously over 1-3 minutes. Rapid
administration of calcium gluconate IV will worsen bradycardia.

a. Renal Injuries (Renal contusion, rupture, or avulsion):
i. Injury to the kidney can be difficult to identify due to the location in the retroperitoneal space.
ii. Urine leakage due to direct renal injury leads to uroretroperitoneum:

vi. Clinicopathologic abnormalities:
bilateral renal trauma:
a. Elevated BUN, creatinine, phosphorus with unconcentrated urine:
i. Specific gravity <1.025 in dogs, <1.035 in cats
b. Oliguria may result with severe renal injury.
 2. Urine leakage and subsequent uroretroperitoneum or uroperitoneum will result in a postrenal azotemia

3. Comparison of retroperitoneal/peritoneal CREA and K+ to blood CREA and K+ will confirm
uroretroperitonum/uroperitoneum, as discussed in the uroperitoneum section above.
4. Renal avulsion and secondary hemorrhage will result in anemia and decreased total solids (see Chapter
3: Shock in the Trauma Patient and Chapter 4: Monitoring of the Trauma Patient).
 5. Additional clinicopathologic abnormalities are related to concurrent injuries.

a. This is indicated in cases of suspected renal or ureteral trauma based on physical examination,
clinicopathologic changes, or survey radiographs.
i. If renal perfusion is poor, the decrease in GFR will result in poor renal opacification secondary to limited
contrast uptake and a nondiagnostic study.
ii. Contrast material has been shown to cause renal injury in human patients, so adequate renal perfusion
is necessary to minimize this risk.
c. Renal tear or laceration will result in leakage of contrast material into the renal subcapsular space,
 retroperitoneal space, or peritoneal space

4.BLADDER INIURIES
a. Urinary bladder rupture:
shen pue shop pazeunein ui wnauotuadoun jo asnen uouwon isou aui sl aunidnu jappelg Aeuun "!
ii. In any patient with blunt abdominal trauma, there should be a high index of suspicion for bladder
rupture, as these injuries can be overlooked:
1. In a study of trauma patients, in the first 12 hours after injury, the diagnosis of ruptured bladder was
a. In this same study, in 22.7% of patients, diagnosis of ruptured bladder was not made until necropsy.
ill. Pathophysiology:
1. Urinary bladder rupture can occur secondary to direct compressive force on the urinary bladder,
Aq jappelg aut jo uoenauad wo do '(oa 'spunom joysung 'spunom atg) Anju! sueauad snouasoxa
bone fragments due to concurrent orthopedic injuries.
2. Rupture of the urinary bladder leads to uroperitoneum and subsequent metabolic and electrolyte
abnormalities:
a. Common electrolyte disturbances include hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, hypochloremia.
b. This occurs because urine is high in potassium and low in sodium and chloride, and these electrolytes
rapidly equilibrate across the peritoneal membrane.
c. Azotemia.
iv. Clinical signs and physical examination findings:
1. Initial clinical signs are often vague and nonspecific:
a. May include lethargy, weakness, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria, hematuria, or anuria.
b. Hematuria is a common clinical sign, but this is neither sensitive nor specific for bladder rupture.
c. Abdominal palpation:
i. Fluid wave
 iil. Abdominal pain due to chemical peritonitis
ili. No palpable bladder:
1. This is not a definitive clinical sign—20% of cats with a ruptured bladder were noted to have a palpable
bladder on physical examination (Aumann et al., (1998).
v. Clinicopathologic abnormalities:
1. Urine leakage and subsequent uroperitoneum will result in a postrenal azotemia due to resorption of
urine and secondary increases in BUN, creatinine, phosphorus, and potassium:
a. The onset of these clinical signs will vary with the severity of the urine leakage and accumulation.
b. Severe azotemia and hyperkalemia is expected in long-standing uroperitoneum (>24 hours).
2.
Comparison of peritoneal effusion CREA and K+to blood CREA and K+will confirm
uroretroperitonum/uroperitoneum, as discussed in the uroperitoneum section above.
3. Hyponatremia and hypochloremia may also be noted.
 4. Additional clinicopathologic abnormalities are related to concurrent injuries.
vi. Diagnosis:
1. Diagnostic imaging:
a. Survey radiographs:
i. Loss of abdominal detail
ii. Inability to visualize the bladder:
1. It is important to note that this finding is supportive of bladder rupture but not diagnostic for this
condition.
b. Ultrasonography:
i. This is diagnostic for abdominal fluid accumulation; rarely diagnostic for ruptured bladder.
c. Analysis of creatinine and potassium in the abdominal effusion and comparison to concurrently derived
blood levels is diagnostic for uroperitoneum as discussed in the uroperitoneum section above.
d. Contrast studies:
i. Positive contrast urethrocystography (see Iable 10.-2):
1. Ruptured bladder will result in extravasation of the contrast medium into the peritoneal space.
 2. May outline irregularities in the bladder wall or intraluminal blood clots.
Urethra, as the study can be viewed in "real-time" while the contrast material is being injected.
 ii.  Excretory urography is not required for the diagnosis of a ruptured bladder, so positive-contrast
1. Excretory urography can be associated with worsening of renal function in a hypovolemic or severely
dehydrated trauma patient.
2. Filling of the urinary bladder takes time and bladder distention is challenging.

followed by removal of the guide wire.
2. More severe injuries (such as urethral transection) or injuries associated with significant urine
extravasation should be treated surgically:

1.INTRODUCTION
a. Abdominal parenchymal organ injury occurs commonly in small animals secondary to trauma. Injury to the
recognition of acute blood loss in the trauma patient is critical to a successful outcome.
2.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

hemorrhage. Inguinal bruising may be noted in animals with retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
j. Ballotment of a fluid wave is an insensitive method of detecting free abdominal fluid and the absence of a
fluid wave does not rule out abdominal hemorrhage
k. Gross abdominal distension will only be seen if at least 40-mL/kg of fluid is within the peritoneum (Crowe
and Devey, (1994)). Potentially fatal hemorrhage from parenchymal injury can therefore occur even in the
absence of abdominal distension.

c. When possible, a venous blood gas with electrolytes, lactate, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine will also
 provide valuable information.

institutions, and methodologies.
v. Lactate concentration increases with increasing severity of hypovolemic shock.
vi. Electrolyte concentrations are typically normal following acute blood loss from abdominal parenchymal
water at the distal nephron.
f. Coagulation assays:
i.Abnormalities in coagulation are common following abdominal parenchymal organ injury and
hemorrhage.
ii. Trauma-induced tissue injury leading to exposure of tissue factor and activation of the coagulation
cascade may result in a consumptive coagulopathy.

and hydrogen ion concentration, and following resuscitation with fluids containing a high concentration of
chloride (e.g., 0.9% NaCl). A buffered crystalloid solution may therefore be a more appropriate
resuscitation fluid than 0.9% NaCl in the patient with a traumatic hemoabdomen and hypovolemia
4. Trauma patients are commonly hypothermic, which further worsens a coagulopathy. Hypothermia may
result from environmental exposure or resuscitation with room-temperature fluids and cool blood
products
iv. Coagulation can be evaluated with laboratory or cage-side assays (e.g., iStat, Abbott Point of Care, East
 prothrombin times (PT) are all readily available.
v. Coagulation assays should be performed if there is clinical evidence of bleeding or prior to performing
an invasive procedure. Correction of a coagulopathy with fresh frozen plasma (15 ml/kg) should be
confirmed through reevaluation of the coagulation assay.
g. Blood type:
i. Abdominal parenchymal organ injury commonly results in hemorrhage requiring transfusion with blood
products.
ii. If time permits, blood typing for DEA 1.1 should be performed for all dogs:
1. Universal (DEA 1.1 negative) blood should be used if blood typing is not possible.
2. DEA 1.1 negative blood may be administered to all dogs.
3. DEA 1.1 positive blood should only be administered to DEA 1.1 positive dogs.
1.1 negative blood. if the transfusion is less urgent, they will need to have their blood cross-matched to a
donor unit.
ill. A blood type (A, B, AB) should be performed for all cats. Transfusion with incompatible blood can
transfusions (weinstein et al., (20o7)). The acute trauma patient may not afford the clinician this time.
h. Arterial blood pressure:
i. Objective data regarding hemodynamic status can be obtained with measurement of arterial blood
pressure.
ii. If an animal is displaying clinical signs of hypovolemia, therapy (i.e., fluid resuscitation) should not be
 delayed pending the acquisition of an arterial blood pressure reading.
il. Arterial blood pressure can provide useful information in patients with equivocal hemodynamic status
be present even in the face of a normal blood pressure.
iv. Continually monitoring arterial blood pressure can provide a valuable means of detecting patient
decompensation
(see Chapter 4: Monitoring of the Trauma Patient).
i. Central venous pressure (CVP):
i. CvP represents the pressure in the intrathoracic vena cava and provides an assessment of preload.

v. Contraindications to central venous catheter placement via the jugular vein include hemostatic

vili. If a CVP reading is questionable, a small test bolus of 10-15 mL/kg of an isotonic crystalloid solution or
a 3-4 mL/kg bolus of a synthetic colloid can be given over 5 minutes:
1. If the patient has a low CvP due to hypovolemia, the CVP will either show no change or will have a
transient rise toward normal, then rapidly decrease again.
 2. An increase of 2-4 cm HzO with a return to baseline within 15 minutes is usually seen with euvolemia.

4. A large increase (greater than 4 cm HzO) and rapid return to baseline (within 15 minutes) is seen with
reduced cardiac compliance.
ix. As a general rule, resuscitation to a CvP slightly above normal (5-8 cm HzO) helps ensure adequate
volume expansion.
j. Electrocardiogram:
i. Ventricular dysrhythmias are common following blunt trauma, and may require therapeutic intervention.
ii. In addition to concurrent myocardial contusion (also called blunt cardiac injury), pain, anxiety, and
hemorrhage can all cause dysrrhythmias (Bansal et al., (2o05)). These conditions are all common

3. Comparison of detail and contrast of the intraperitoneal space with the retroperitoneal space is a
convenient method of evaluation.
compromise to the body wall.
5. Loss of detail in the retroperitoneal space is often described as "streaking" and occurs due to
intermingling of fluid with retroperitoneal fat and structures. Loss of a visible renal silhouette and ventral
de pression of the colon on lateral radiographs suggest fluid in the retroperitoneal space.
ii. Abdominal ultrasound:
1. FAST (focused assessment with sonography for trauma):
a. May be performed within minutes of the patients' arrival by clinicians with little ultrasonographic
training (Boysen et al., (0).
b. The goal of the FAST is fluid detection.
c. With the patient in lateral recumbency, four areas are examined in two planes:
i. Subxiphoid.
ii. Midline over the bladder
 ii. Gravity-dependent flank
iv. Gravity-independent flank
d. Fluid (when identified) may be obtained via ultrasound-guided paracentesis.
2. Experienced ultrasonographers may detect abdominal parenchymal injury.
I. Abdominocentesis (Figure 11.-1):
i. Abdominocentesis may be performed with or without (blind) ultrasound guidance.

1. Abdominocentesis using a closed technique can be sequentially performed in each of four quadrants
centered around the umbilicus.
2. Alternatively, 2-4 separate open needles can be simultaneously inserted. A change in abdominal
pressure between the needles may increase yield (Jandrey, (2008)).

4.MEDICAL MANAGEMENT
a. The primary therapeutic goal is restoration of normal cardiovascular function. This is achieved by attaining
hemostasis and correcting hypovolemia.
b. Fluid resuscitation will improve cardiac output, and subsequently restore tissue perfusion:
i. There are multiple options for fluid resuscitation of the patient with parenchymal organ injury and
hemoabdomen.
ii.Resuscitation should be accomplished with multiple small volumes of parenteral fluid with frequent
 physical examination and close monitoring of end points of resuscitation.

this is followed by normotensive resuscitation (see Chapter 3: Shock in the Trauma Patient).
c. Isotonic crystalloids:
i. Multiple small volume aliquots of an isotonic crystalloid solution is typically the first choice of fluid in the
trauma patient with abdominal parenchymal injury.
ii. Dogs that have signs consistent with mild hypoperfusion may only require 20-30 ml/kg of isotonic
 crystalloids and the addition of colloids
ii. Hypovolemic cats may respond to a single 10-20 ml/kg bolus of an isotonic crystalloid solution, or may
require a repeated isotonic crystalloid bolus and the addition of a colloid.
concentration of chloride in 0.9% NaCl may contribute to an existing metabolic acidosis. The use of 0.9%
saline, however, will restore tissue perfusion and it is also compatible with blood and blood products.
v. Caution should be exercised to avoid increasing hydrostatic pressure relative to colloid oncotic pressure,

that has respiratory compromise from pulmonary contusion.

vii. Only 25% of a crystalloid infusion will remain in the intravascular space after one hour.
d. Hypertonic saline:
i. Hypertonic saline (typically, 7.2-7.5% NaCl) can provide rapid correction of hypotension in the trauma
patient.
ii. Infusion of a hypertonic crystalloid solution creates a large osmotic gradient that draws water from the
interstitial and intracellular fluid compartments and results in rapid expansion of intravascular volume.
ili. Its effects are diminished within 30 minutes but can be prolonged with the addition of a synthetic
colloid.
iv. Contraindications to hypertonic saline administration include dehydration, hyperosmolality, and
uncontrolled hemorrhage.

restoration of normovolemia may be short-lived. Caution should therefore be exercised before the use of
hypertonic saline in a patient with traumatic abdominal injury.
vi. A dose of 4-6 ml/kg should be administered at a rate no faster than 1 mL/kg/min. A dose of 2-3 mL/kg
should be used in the cat.
e. Synthetic colloids:
longer than crystalloids, and as result are more efficient at maintaining intravascular volume.
iil. Loss of protein through hemorrhage, and dilution with interstitial fluids will decrease serum albumin,
total solids (as measured by refractometry), and thus colloid oncotic pressure.
ili. Hypovolemic patients with a total protein below than 4.5 g/dL may benefit from resuscitation with
colloids.
iv. A bolus of 5 ml/kg synthetic colloid may be required in the mildly hypovolemic trauma patient,

v. Autotransfusion is an autologous transfusion technique that utilizes the animal's intraperitoneal blood:
1. Blood should not be transfused if bacterial contamination has occurred (e.g., bowel rupture or
penetrating injury).
2. Blood is collected from the abdomen using a peritoneal dialysis catheter, other multi-fenestrated
catheter, over-the-needle catheter, or hypodermic needle.

g. Abdominal counterpressure:
ii. Abdominal counterpressure can be rapidly achieved (with or without inclusion of the hindlimbs) using
bandaging materials and tape. Preplacement of a urinary catheter should be considered prior to
application.
ill. An increase in intra-abdominal pressure may lead to abdominal compartment syndrome, with resultant
compromise to organ perfusion (e.g., renal) and hypoventilation. The duration of counterpressure should
therefore be minimized to reduce the incidence of complications. The authors prefer to have the bandage
removed within 6-8 hours.

bandage over approximately 2-4 hours.
i. Analgesics (see Chapter 5: Analgesia and Anesthesia for the Trauma Patient):
i. Appropriate analgesia should be instituted as early as possible following presentation and adjusted
according to response.
ii. Opioids provide good systemic analgesia with little effect on the cardiovascular system.
il. Because of impaired organ perfusion, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NsAIDs) should be avoided
in the early stages of patient stabilization.

i. Fluids and blood products should be available to administer following cessation of hemorrhage.
j. A staged laparotomy may be considered in patients with exsanguinating penetrating abdominal injury.
k. Surgical approach to hemoabdomen:
i. The patient is prepared for immediate surgery.
 ili. The technique used to open the abdomen is critical:
1. The midline skin is opened from xiphoid to pubis.
 2. The linea alba is identified and opened between the xiphoid and the umbilicus:
a. At this point, the falciform fat is visible.
b. The ventral surface of the falciform is not within the peritoneal cavity.
c. This exposure is enough to allow the surgeon to get a hand into the abdomen:
i. Locate the aorta and renal artery by tracing the artery from the hilus of the kidney.
 ii. Locate the opposite renal artery.

d. Occlude the celiac artery with digital pressure. This procedure has been documented to prevent the
devastating and often fatal hypotension that results when the tamponade effect of the abdominal
distension is relieved.

the Pringle maneuver should be attempted:
i. The hepatic artery, the portal vein, and the common bile duct are occluded using digital pressure.
ii. After 10 minutes, the portal occlusion must be released for at least 1 minute every 10 minutes.
 ill. If the source of hemorrhage is found, it is repaired at this time and then a full exploratory is
performed.
h. The three most common sources of hemorrhage from abdominal trauma are the spleen, liver, and
kidney
i. Emergency surgery of the spleen:
i. Anatomy of the splenic vasculature includes the splenic artery and splenic veins. The splenic artery is a
direct branch of the celiac artery. Before the splenic artery branches and delivers oxygen rich blood to the

supply to the left portion of the greater curvature). Other branches of the splenic artery supply the
greater omentum. Numerous small arteries form the hilar vessels of the spleen that are located along the
majority of the base of the organ.
ii. If a laceration is found it can be sutured primarily and splenectomy is avoided. Splenorrhaphy can be
performed by primarily ligating any exposed and bleeding vessels. The capsule of the spleen is then

agents, such as Gelfoam (Pharmacia & Upjohn Company, Division of Pfizer Inc., New York, NY), are all that
are needed in the patient with normal platelet number and function and that is not overtly coagulopathic.
iv. Two general techniques exist for splenectomy.
 splenic artery is identified, isolated, and ligated. The ligation should be distal to the left pancreatic artery
exgsuen auo pue paneid si anea uuua auo ae pualds aun jo susyoueg aue on leu xoud ing
suture is placed. A hemostat, second encircling suture, or vascular clip is applied distal to the last suture
to prevent back bleeding when the artery is transected. The same is performed with the splenic vein dista
to its entrance into the left gastric vein. It is important to remember that there are also small arteries and

and temporary clamped with an appropriate vascular clamp (i.e., Satinsky forcep) or tourniquet. This wil
slow any parenchymal hemorrhage and enable better visualization along the hilus of the spleen. Each
hilar artery and vein is identified, isolated, and ligated twice using an encircling ligature. After alligations
have been performed, the spleen is removed by cutting the hilar vessels distal to the last ligature.
vil. Other commonly used instruments for splenectomy include, vascular clips, ligate-divide-stapler (LDS-
ultrasonic energy surgery, and other coagulation devices.
j. Emergency surgery of the liver:
i. Surgical anatomy includes the individual lobes of the liver, including; the left lateral, left medial,
quadrate, right medial, right lateral, caudate process of the caudate lobe, and the papillary process of the

duct draining bile into the common bile duct.
lacerations are implemented.
ili. For major liver lobe trauma, each major artery branch, hepatic vein branch, portal vein branch, and
hepatic duct must be identified, isolated, and ligated. The Pringle maneuver (described above) will often
need to be implemented to control hemorrhage during dissection of the hepatic veins off of the vena
cava. Proper training in vascular surgery is often required for liver lobectomy or in cases with severe liver
venous vasculature. In some cases, usually the left lateral and left medial liver lobes, the vascular pedicle
can  be identified  as a portion of it is extrahepatic.  In these cases, a thoracic
anastamosis/thoracoabdominal stapler (TA Premium 30, US Surgical, A Division of Tyco Healthcare Group
LP, Mansfield, MA) may be used. The ideal cartridge to be used is a TA30 (referring to the 30 mm
staggered staple line) V3 (referring to the three rows of staggered staples that are set), manufactured by
the aforementioned company. Because of the short length of the staple line and short arm length of the
staples, this device is only recommended for liver lobectomy when the vascular pedicle is free of
surrounding liver parenchyma. Otherwise, the staples will fail to close appropriately around the large
vessels and severe hemorrhage will ensue after transection.
k. Trauma to the kidney:

 2. Ductal morphology is different between dogs and cats:
a. In dogs, the common bile duct and pancreatic duct enter the duodenum together, but not conjoined,
 at the major duodenal papilla, which is located approximately 3-6 cm aboral to the pylorus.
b. In dogs, a minor duodenal papilla is located approximately 2-4 cm aboral to the major duodenal papilla 
secretions into the duodenum in dogs.
c. In cats, the common bile duct and pancreatic duct are conjoined prior to their entry into the duodenum
at the major duodenal papilla. Only @20% of cats have a minor duodenal papilla, meaning that all
pancreatic exocrine secretions must pass into the gastrointestinal tract through the major duodenal
papilla in the majority of cats.

3.PATHOPHYSIOLOGY-CAUSE AND LOCATION OF BLIARY TRAUMA IN DOGS
a. Etiology of injury:
i. Blunt trauma:

2. Blunt trauma sustained during a fall (high-rise syndrome) is a rare cause of EHBT injury.
3. It is most likely that a combination of the following factors combine to cause biliary tract injury: a short
leads to rapid emptying and a simultaneous shearing force that is applied to the common bile duct or
hepatic ducts:
a. Blunt trauma-induced bile duct rupture has been described in cholecystectomized humans suggesting
that rapid ductal filling is not always mandatory for injury to occur.
4. It is likely that during blunt trauma rapid cranial movement of the liver away from the relatively wel
fixed duodenum results in a traction force that can result in tearing or avulsion injuries of the common
bile duct.

b. The greater the velocity of the projectile, the greater the kinetic energy released and therefore the
greater the likelihood of damage to tissues remote from the projectile's tract.
3. Stab wounds generally are low-velocity injuries that are more likely to cause direct laceration or
pe rforation of tissues.
4. Dog bite wounds (see Chapter 20: Bite Wound Trauma):

occurrence of necrotizing cholecystitis, gall bladder infarction, and gall bladder mucocele
ill. when leakage occurs as a result of trauma, however, the location of the perforation is almost always
reported:
1. The most common lesions are tears or transections within the body of the common bile duct and less
frequently within the cystic duct. Also common are avulsion injuries of the common bile duct from the
duodenum or avulsions of hepatic ducts from the common bile duct.
2. This information is useful as it may allow a more focused and rapid identification of the site of leakage
at surgery if trauma is known to be the cause.
4.PATHOPHYSIOLOGY-CAUSE AND LOCATION OF BLIARY TRAUMA IN CATS
 b. Two cats had sustained injury from gunshots (Ludwig et al., 1997) and the third was hit by a car (Bacon and
White, 2003).

of the common bile duct from the duodenum was present in the other.
 d. The cat that was hit by a car sustained a CBD avulsion injury.
5.PATHOPHYSIOLOGY-BILE PERITONITIS
a. The inevitable result of traumatic EHBT injury is spillage of bile into the abdominal cavity.
b. This can remain localized if surgical exploration occurs soon after the injury. More often, there is a delay in
levels of morbidity and mortality in these patients.
c. Local effects:
Saueuo iesoouied ieui aui ot algisuodsan Aidioud s wnauoad aur oui shis aa jo asealat aui !s
that occur.
ii. Bile salts cause inflammation, hemolysis, and necrosis of tissue. Their hyperosmolality leads to
significant fluid shifts from the vascular space into the peritoneal cavity, which causes dehydration and
eventually hypovolemic shock.
ii. High proportions of one of the most toxic bile salts, taurocholic acid, in canine bile is thought to
increase severity of lesions compared to humans.
growth of bacteria more readily once a bacterial source has been provided.
V. In the absence of bacterial infection, biliary peritonitis causes a mild chemical peritonitis. The
establishment of septic effusion profoundly worsens pathology and subsequent prognosis:
compared to those with sterile effusion (Ludwig et al., 1997, Mehler 2004).
3. In penetrating injuries, bacterial infection can be introduced via direct inoculation.
d. Systemic effects:
i. Biliary tract trauma with bile peritonitis can result in a partial or total absence of bile salts passing into
the small intestine.
preventing their absorption into the portal circulation. Lack of this protective effect may predispose to
sepsis, severe sepsis, and multiple organ failure.
ili. Renal vascular compromise and fibrin deposition can result in acute renal failure.
iv. Hypotension can result secondary to decreased cardiac output as a result of hypovolemia caused by
third spacing of fluids and impaired myocardial contractility. This is exacerbated by systemic vasodilation as
 a result of the systemic inflammatory response that is occurring.
v. Coagulation abnormalities can result from the failure of absorption of vitamin-K, a fat-soluble vitamin
that in the absence of dietary fat emulsification by bile salts fails to become absorbed. Vitamin K is

b. The most common clinical signs in dogs and cats with bile peritonitis are vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea, and
weight loss, which may not be evident until several days after the traumatic incident.
c. Most patients with bile peritonitis will demonstrate abdominal pain and may exhibit abdominal distension
secondary to the accumulation of biliary effusion.

e. Icterus is usually evident once the serum bilirubin concentration exceeds 1.5-2.0 mg/dL
f. On physical examination, patients that sustain blunt trauma may show evidence of bruising, superficial
abrasions, lacerations, or may have deeper wounds in the case of penetrating injury.
 g. There may be evidence of concurrent orthopedic or neurological injury.
7.DIAGNOSIS OF EHBT INJURY
a. Injury to the EHBT can be clinically silent for substantial periods especially when the cause is blunt
abdominal trauma. One study reported a mean delay between trauma and diagnosis of 14 days (Ludwig et al.,
1997).
b. Any animal sustaining penetrating injury to the abdomen should undergo an abdominal exploratory

of the stent exits through the major duodenal papilla into the duodenum. There they can be anchored to
the duodenal mucosa with 1-2 sutures. (Figure 12.-4).

 Loss of continuity of the ventral body wall can be seen in this cat with a traumatic abdominal wall hernia.
i. Plain radiography is important diagnostically to look for evidence of discontinuity in the body wall (Figure
13.-3). Evidence of organ displacement into the hernia may also be visible.
ii. The presence of small intestinal loops containing gas pockets are usually easy to visualize and detect
within body wall hernias; however, herniation of omentum may be more difficult to detect.
 il. In one study, only 42% of traumatic body wall hernias were detected with plain radiography (Shaw et
al., 2003).
iv. If a suspicion for herniation exists, ultrasonography may be helpful in confirming a diagnosis, although
its diagnostic accuracy is unknown in veterinary patients.
d. Surgical exploration:
i. Exploratory laparotomy is warranted in cases where the diagnosis cannot be firmly established based on
the above criteria. Laparoscopic exploration of the abdomen could be used to diagnose abdominal wall
defects giving the advantage of a minimally invasive approach.

 a. Trauma involving the abdominal cavity can result in multiple organ injury.
b. In urban dogs, gunshot injury is the most common cause of abdominal trauma accounting for a third of

e. Blunt trauma:

causes injury to the brain, thorax, appendicular skeleton, spine, and solid organs within the abdomen.
Bowel injuries are relatively rare following blunt trauma. Mesenteric tears and vascular compromise are

FLGURE 14.-1
Surgery, Saunders, 2010.)
ii. Three different mechanisms that cause injury to the abdominal viscera may be involved:
1. A sudden dramatic rise in intra-abdominal pressure ruptures hollow viscera or solid organs.
 2. Compression of abdominal viscera against the thoracic cage or thoracic spine.
3. Sudden shearing forces leading to tears or avulsions of organs or vascular pedicles.
ili. The gastrointestinal tract is relatively free floating in the abdominal cavity and only has loose
attachments to the body wall through the mesenteric root. Along with its considerable compressibility this

ii. The abdominal area is frequently injured during dog fights or dog on cat fights. In one study, 24% of
dogs and 27% of cats that sustained bite wounds had injuries in the abdominal area (Shamir et al., (2002).
 Small dogs are more likely to have abdominal injury than larger dogs. Of dogs and cats that undergo wound

when surgery is performed in the cervical area.
ii. Gastrointestinal perforation can also occur during endoscopic interventions, passing stomach tubes,
enema ad ministration, or diagnostic rectal examination.
3.PATHOPHYSIOLOGY-SEPTIC PERITONITIS
a. The inevitable result of bowel perforation is septic peritonitis.
b.  Septic peritonitis initiates an acute inflammatory reaction that initially involves the activation of
complement (especially C3a and C5a), thus inducing neutrophil chemotaxis and degranulation of basophils
and mast cells.
c. Degranulation releases histamine and prostaglandins, which cause vasodilation and increased vascular
 permeability in turn leading to increased exudation of protein and fluid into the peritoneal cavity.

fluid shifts into the peritoneal cavity lead to dilution of bacteria and debris.
f. In most cases, self-protective mechanisms are soon overwhelmed where the underlying source of
contamination can no longer be controlled.
g. Hypovolemia and hypoproteinemia soon develop as fluid shifts from the intravascular space to the
 peritoneal cavity. Local defenses suffer as opsonins are diluted and phagocytic function is impaired.
ischemia can lead to renal insufficiency and eventually acute renal failure. Tissue hypoxia causes anerobic

d. Peritoneal fluid analysis:
i. Fluid analysis is the key to the prompt diagnosis of septic peritonitis, which in most cases of traumatic
injury to the abdominal cavity will be the result of gastrointestinal tract rupture.
ii. Peritoneal fluid can be retrieved by simple abdominocentesis, four quadrant abdominocentesis,
diagnostic peritoneal lavage, or via ultrasound-guided abdominocentesis.
ili. In cases of septic peritonitis, the character of the fluid is likely that of an exudate. Exudates have a high

iv. A direct smear of the fluid and a smear of the sediment of abdominal fluid should be evaluated on an
emergency basis for the following parameters:
1. Cellularity: Septic peritonitis will have a moderate to very cellular characteristic unless the
contamination has just occurred:
a. Typically, if a direct smear is made of abdominal effusion white blood cell counts >5/high power field
are suggestive of an inflammatory exudate that could be consistent with peritonitis. However, smear
preparation and centrifugation will significantly affect the number of cells seen on direct smears.
b. Clumps of white blood cells are often indicative of elevation of white blood cell numbers.

2. Types of cells present:
a. There are often both small numbers of red blood cells and larger numbers of white blood cells present
in septicperitoneal effusions.
b. Neutrophils are the predominant white blood cell noted in septic peritonitis. These neutrophils wil
demonstrate variable degrees of degeneration (Figure 14.-3). Macrophages will occur in higher numbers
as the effusion becomes more chronic.
FLGURE 14.-3
 Presence of bacteria:
14.-3).
b. In some cases, bacteria may not be readily identified but the suspicion for intra-abdominal infection
 may remain high due to the results of other diagnostic tests. This may be due to early peritonitis or
 localized disease or the lack of skilled cytologists to evaluate the samples harvested. with a diagnosis of
that can be measured more objectively.
Glucose concentration:
a. Peripheral blood-to-peritoneal fluid glucose difference >20 mg/dL is 100% sensitive and specific for
diagnosis of septic peritonitis in dogs and 86% sensitive and 100% specific in cats based on a study of 18
dogs and 12 cats (Bonczynski et al., (2003)
Lactate concentration:
based on a study of 19 dogs. In cats, this parameter was not found to be helpful (Levin et al., (2004)).
Nucleated cell count:
a. A peritoneal fluid nucleated cell count above 13,000 cells/μl has an 86% sensitivity and 100%
 specificity in dogs and 100% sensitivity and specificity in cats for diagnosis of septic peritonitis (Bonczynski
et al., (2003)).
Some caution should be used in interpreting the diagnostic characteristics of abdominal fluid glucose,
lactate, and nucleated cell count. The information obtained using these parameters was determined in a
study that compared animals with peritonitis to many animals with abdominal effusion that was not
characterized by significant inflammation. It is possible that the changes in glucose, lactate, and nucleated
peritoneum, rather than being specific for intraperitoneal sepsis.
e. Endoscopy:
i. Endoscopic evaluation can be useful for evaluation of injury to the esophagus, stomach, and proximal
duodenum. However, perforation can be missed using endoscopy alone and it does not allow assessment
of vascular integrity.
f. Surgical exploration:
 i. Exploratory laparotomy can be pursued as a diagnostic and therapeutic intervention in cases where
traumatic bowel injury is suspected.

b. The most important aspects in treating ocular injuries are to:
i. Prevent loss of vision
ii. Prevent loss of the eye
ili. Alleviate pain
iv. Prevent long-term complications
c. Most ocular injuries occur concurrently with head trauma and these injuries should always be addressed
d. Other major body system abnormalities should be rapidly assessed and treatment instituted.

performed and a more complete ophthalmic examination performed once the animal is stable. The rapid
examination includes evaluating the following:
i. The globe—intact or proptosed
ii. Conjunctiva—hemorrhage, lacerations
iv. Sclera and cornea—intact, ulcer, laceration, rupture
v. Anterior chamber—anterior uveitis, hyphema
vi. Pupil size, responsiveness, symmetry (see Chapter 7: Traumatic Brain Injury)
 f. A sterile, water-based lubricant or topical antibiotic ointment can be placed on the globe every 1-2 hours
until a more thorough examination can occur.
g. Once the animal is deemed stable, a complete ophthalmic examination, including repeating the initial
examination and performing a fundic examination should follow. Evaluating for the direct and indirect

d.The eye should be fluorescein stained at presentation to determine the presence and extent of corneal
injury. If a corneal abrasion or ulcer is present, then topical antibiotic ointment (triple antibiotic ointment in
dogs and erythromycin ointment (0.3%) in cats) should be started three to four times a day.
e. Two treatment options have been advocated:
i. Temporary tarsorrhaphy to protect the cornea (see above, Proptosis)
ii. Application of a sterile lubricant with or without topical antibiotics to protect the cornea while the
swelling is resolving.
ili. The decision is based on the stability of the patient and if the eyelids can actually be moved and closed.
Some swelling is so severe that the eyelids cannot be pulled over the globe.

b. Clinical signs include a miotic pupil, swollen, red or "fluffy" iris, aqueous flare, hyphema, blepharospasm,
and conjunctival hyperemia.
c. An intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement should be performed. IOP will be low (<10 mm Hg, normal
15-25 mm Hg) in anterior uveitis secondary to decreased production of aqueous humor.
d. The cornea should be fluorescein stained to rule out a concurrent corneal ulcer.

i. The use of topical corticosteroids has not been conclusively shown to be of benefit, although some
ophthalmologists advocate the use of topical corticosteroids for a secondary anterior uveitis (iridocyclitis)
(secondary to mediators released from blood cells).
j. If there is an elevated lOP and constricted pupil, then a sympathomimetic drug (e.g., dipivefrin 0.1%) can be
used two times a day to dilate the pupil. Topical medications to control the lOP should also be started
(dorzolamide TID, timolol TID). The eye should be rechecked in 24-48 hours.

the anterior chamber, and possibly visualization of the edge of the lens, especially dorsally.
il. An IOP measurement should be taken. If greater than 35 mm Hg, then mannitol (1-2 g/kg IV over 20
minutes) should be started (see Glaucoma above).
ii. Topical antiglaucoma medications (dorzolamide, timolol) should be started three times a day.
Latanoprost is contraindicated. (see Glaucoma above).

iv. If the laceration was full thickness, close it in two layers (conjunctiva then skin), taking care to appose
the eyelid margins as described above.
v. Take care to preserve the lacrimal puncta if the laceration is at the ventral medial canthus to prevent
 epiphora and conjunctivitis. If involving the puncta, consultation with an ophthalmologist is advised.
vi. Systemic broad-spectrum antibiotics such as amoxicillin-clavulonic acid (15 mg/kg BID orally) should be
started. Topical antibiotics are not needed due to the abundant blood supply to the eyelids.
vii. An Elizabethan collar should be worn for 7-10 days.
c. Third eyelid lacerations:
i. If only the conjunctiva (or top layer) was damaged, then surgery is not needed to repair the laceration
due to an adequate blood supply and rapid healing.
ii. If the membrane of the third eyelid gland was lacerated, then a simple continuous pattern can be used
with 4-0 absorbable monofilament suture or silk to close the laceration.

b. Clinical signs include blindness with a negative menace and negative direct and indirect PLR, hyphema,
subconjunctival hemorrhage, and eyelid and conjunctival swelling.
c. The eye may look smaller or collapsed.
d. An IOP reading can be low.
e. Ultrasound of the eye is used to help diagnose a scleral rupture and should be performed in any eye where
the intraocular structures are not visible. An area of ill-defined scleral margins can be seen along with echoic
material in the anterior and posterior chamber and vitreous.
f. Treatment usually consists of enucleation, although there are no studies to determine long-term prognosis
in a scleral rupture that is not enucleated. Most likely, the eye will become phthisical.
g. Since cats are prone to develop post traumatic sarcomas secondary to an ocular trauma (see below),
enucleation may be the best option for cats.
14.POST TRAUMATIC SARCOMA
a. Can occur in cats secondary to any ocular trauma, trauma to the lens, post intraocular surgery, and chronic
uveitis.
b. The cause is unknown but the tumor is a highly malignant type of neoplasia:
i. It invades the optic nerve and retina.
ii. It metastasizes to regional lymph nodes and distant sites.
d. Ultrasound can be used to diagnose an intraocular mass.
e. Chest radiographs should be performed to rule out pulmonary metastatic disease.
f. Exenteration is recommended:
i. Exenteration refers to surgery to remove the entire contents of the orbit.
iil. All tissue should then be submitted for biopsy.
g. The long term prognosis is guarded to poor due to the likelihood of metastatic disease, especially if there is
evidence of extrascleral extension on histopathology of the globe.

15.CONJUNCTIVAL GRAFT/FLAP PLACEMENT (FigUreS 15.-21 and 15.-22)
a. A conjunctival flap or graft is performed when extra support is needed for the cornea. The flap will supply
fibroblasts to promote corneal healing and provide a blood supply to deliver anticollagenases and systemically
administered antibiotics to the lesion.
b. A conjunctival graft or flap is indicated for deep corneal ulcers where the ulcer spans more than 50% of the
corneal ulcers, descemetoceles, or perforated corneas because they do not provide a blood supply and they
impair monitoring of the lesion.
d.
 Ideally, an ophthalmologist should be consulted, as there are other alternative surgeries that an
ophthalmologist can perform to protect the cornea instead (e.g., corneoscleral transposition).
e. A very common type of conjunctival graft is the pedicle flap.

conjunctiva directly above or closest to the site of the corneal defect.
ii. An incision in made in the conjunctiva parallel to the limbus, about 2 mm from the limbus.
iv. The incision should extend the length of the corneal defect, so that it will cover the width of the defect.

careless use of thermocautery, diathermy, electrosurgery and laser units near teeth, and electric cord 
injuries.
e. Tooth displacement injuries:
i. Concussion and subluxation—Normal or slightly increased mobility and sensitivity to percussion, but no
displacement; monitor radiographically to determine pulp vitality.
ii. Luxation—-Clinically or radiographically evident displacement of the tooth within its alveolus:
1. Lateral and extrusive luxation—most common; often associated with fracture of the alveolus (Figures
16.-6a and 16.-6b).
2. Intrusive luxation—rare; associated with trauma that forced a tooth into the nasal cavity, resulting in
chronic rhinitis and nasal discharge; sometimes noticed in retired Greyhound racing dogs; tooth
extraction necessitates surgical exposure of the nasal cavity through an intraoral approach.

g. Pathophysiology and radiographic signs:
i. Pulpitis-—Inflammation of the pulp:
1. Reversible pulpitis-Thermal stimuli (usually cold) cause a pain response that subsides as soon as the
stimulus is removed; removal of the irritant resolves the pulpitis.
2. Irreversible pulpitis—This may be acute, subacute, or chronic, partial or total, infected or sterile;
acutely inflamed pulp is symptomatic (prolonged episodes of pain); chronically inflamed pulp is usually
asymptomatic; reddish cauliflower-like growth of pulp tissue through an open pulp chamber is
occasionally seen in young animals.
ii. Pulp necrosis:
1. Resulting from an irreversible pulpitis or a traumatic event that causes long-term interruption of the
blood supply to the pulp.
3. Spread of infection/inflammation through apical foramina leads to periapical disease.
ili. Acute apical periodontitis:
1. Painful inflammation around the apex before the bone begins to resorb.

c. Mandibular fractures occur more frequently than maxillary fractures.
d. Traumatic versus pathologic:
i. Traumatic jaw fractures are secondary to automobile trauma, falls, kicks, hits, gunshots, and fights with
other animals.
ii. Pathologic jaw fractures are secondary to severe periodontal disease, oral neoplasia, and metabolic
abnormalities (e.g., hyperparathyroidism).

often occur after trauma in areas with loss of alveolar bone around teeth due to periodontal disease

d. Mandibular symphyseal se paration.
e. An animal that presents with a history of TMJ injury may either not be able to open or to close the mouth.
Thus, most TMJ disorders and their differentials can be placed in one or the other category:
i. Unable to close the mouth:
1. TMJ luxation +/- associated fracture of bones forming the joint.
2. Open-mouth jaw locking (TMJ subluxation/luxation with coronoid process displacement).
3. Fracture of the zygomatic arch/coronoid process +/- excessive callus formation.
4. Trigeminal neuropathy (mandibular neurapraxia).
5. Neurogenic atrophy of muscles of mastication.

 g. Radiographic evaluation of the TMJ is traditionally performed with standard medical radiographic film and
helpful to add an open-mouth view to the series:

iv. When radiographs do not provide enough detail of the TMJ, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic
resonance imaging (MRl) may be necessary.
h. TMJ luxation:
i. With rostrodorsal luxation, the mandibular condyle moves rostrally and dorsally, causing the lower jaw
to shift laterorostrally to the contralateral side and inability of the animal to close its mouth fully due to
upper lips, obscuring visualization of the oral orifice, or if the mandibular body also is fractured.
FIGURE 16.-23
 Photograph of a cat with rostrodorsal luxation of the left mandibular condyle, causing the lower jaw to shift
laterorostrally to the right side and inability of the animal to close its mouth fully due to tooth-by-tooth contact.
This distinguishes it from open-mouth jaw locking where the mouth is held wide open without contact between
mandibular and maxillary teeth.
ii. Cats have a higher incidence of luxation due to decreased mandibular symphyseal movement and
shorter jaw length, compared to dogs.
ii. The well, developed retroarticular process resists caudal displacement of the mandibular condyle;
FIGURE 16.-24

the condyle) and increased width of the left temporomandibular joint space (double-ended arrows).

iv. A dorsoventral radiographic view best demonstrates luxation, revealing increased width of the joint
space and rostral displacement of the mandibular condyle (Figure 16.-24).
v. Acute treatment-Reduction of luxation is obtained by placing a wood dowel (pencil in smaller animals)
between the upper and lower carnassial teeth on the affected side only (dowel acts as a fulcrum) and
opening the mouth wide and reduce the likelihood of recurring displacement.

ii. Traumatic cleft palate (Figures 16.-27a and 16.-27b) is a midline cleft of the hard palate usually
 associated with falls from heights (e.g., high-rise syndrome in cats); although some of these clefts (if they
are very narrow) could heal spontaneously in 2-4 weeks with conservative management, the benefit of
initial surgical management outweighs the risk of developing a persistent palate defect.

ili. Electric cord injury occurs most often in young animals, with burns often progressing deep into tissue
 along pathways of current flow; life-threatening complications are usually related to neurogenic pulmonary
edema or smoke inhalation; initially, the patient is managed conservatively (wound lavage and antibiotic
therapy), and the injured tissues are left to necrose so that the maximum amount of tissue is retained;
is common, and oronasal defects require further surgery.

prior to surgical repair.
c. The choice of surgical repair of palate defects depends on the location and size of the defect and the
amount of tissue available for flap procedures:
i. Principles of palate surgery:
1. The best chance of success is with the first procedure.
2. Teeth at the surgical site and those that could traumatize flaps should be extracted.
3. Electrocoagulation for hemostasis should be avoided.
4. Flaps must be made larger than the defect they will cover.
5. Blood supply must be retained to the flaps.
6. Flaps should be handled as carefully as possible.
8. A two-layer closure should be provided if practical.
9. Suture lines should not be located over a void if possible.
10. Closure under tension must be avoided.
Therefore, early referral is advised rather than making attempts at closure that could further compromise
viability of available tissue:
Advancement flap-Usually sufficient to close an oronasal fistula in the area of an extracted or missing
tooth.
connective tissue is large, which results in a stronger scar.
Medially positioned double flap (usually with uni- or bilateral releasing incisions along the dental
palates that did not heal.
Modified split palatal U-flap—Useful for large caudal hard palate defects.
Combinations of advancement, rotation, transposition, overlapping, and axial pattern flaps, which are
created from available palatal and vestibular mucosa and sutured across the defect 6-8 weeks following
extraction of several teeth.
Tongue flap-The edges of the dorsal aspect of the tongue are excised and apposed to the debrided edges
of the palatal defect; the tongue is separated from the palate several weeks later, leaving enough tongue
tissue with the palate to close the defect without tension.
Myoperitoneal free flaps.
Permanent or removable silicone or acrylic obturator.

2.ANATOMYAND TERMINOLOGY
1. Rostral-Referring to a location toward the tip of the nose.
 2. Caudal—Referring to a location toward the tail.
3. Ventral—Referring to a location toward the lower jaw.
4. Dorsal—Referring to a location toward the top of the head or muzzle.
b. Terms describing a location in reference to the teeth:
1. Mesial—Surface of the tooth closest to the midline of the dental arch, which is the most rostral crown
surface of the crown.
2. Distal—Surface of the tooth that is farthest from the midline of the dental arch, which is the most
caudal crown surface of the canine, premolar and molar teeth; when referring to the incisors, the distal
side is the most lateral surface of the crown.
3. Vestibular—Surface of the tooth facing the lips or cheek; "buccal" and "labial" are acceptable
alternatives.
 4. Facial— Refers to the surfaces of the rostral teeth visible from the front.
 5. Lingual—Refers to the surface of mandibular teeth facing the tongue.
6. Palatal— Refers to the surface of maxillary teeth facing the palate.
7. Occlusal— Refers to the surface of the tooth facing the tooth of the opposing dental arch.
8. Proximal-Mesial and distal surfaces of a tooth that come in close contact to an adjacent tooth.
 9. Interproximal—Refers to the space between adjacent teeth.
c. Terms of specific soft tissue structures of the oral cavity and pharynx:
 1. Frenulum—V-shaped fold of mucosa seen most obviously at sites like the ventral tongue surface (lingua
frenulum) and the vestibular surface of the mandible lateral to the canine and premolar teeth (labial
frenulum).
2. Caruncle-Fleshy protuberance, most commonly seen associated with the openings of the sublingual
 and mandibular salivary ducts beneath the tongue.
3. Palatoglossal folds—Bilateral bands of tissue that run from the caudal aspect of the tongue to the soft
palate.
4. Buccal mucosa-Mucosa of the lip and cheek, which lies against the teeth.

5.LACERATIONS AND BITE WOUNDS
a. Many of the tenets of bite wound and laceration treatment (see Chapter 20: Bite Wound Trauma) apply to
orofacial lacerations and bite wounds, but some differences in treatment exist:
1. Lacerations and bite wounds often create full thickness penetration of the oral mucosa and skin.
2. As in other areas of the body, bite wounds may present as the "tip of the iceberg" and soft tissue
trauma is often accompanied by hard tissue trauma. Dogs can generate upward of 450 psi of force with
their jaws. The length of the canine teeth in dogs and cats and the strength of the jaws may cause jaw

d. Temporary bite wound care in the critical patient:
1. Attempts should be made to minimize the contamination of open wounds. Keep extraoral wounds
 covered with a sterile gauze dressing until initial assessment and lavage are performed.
 2. Cultures of bite wound fluid or tissue may be submitted prior to administration of broad-spectrum
antibiotics. Cultures obtained from intraoral wounds or superficial extraoral wounds are likely to result in
growth of contaminants.

2. Wounds should be explored, debrided, and thoroughly lavaged with warm saline or dilute (0.12%)
chlorhexidine digluconate. The viability of tissues should be assessed based on color, temperature, and
second intention whereas intraoral wounds are often closed at the time of initial debridement.

should be taken to ensure all severed vessels have been located and ligated so the drain does not act as a
portal for continued bleeding. Drains should not be placed to lie directly under the suture line if at al
possible. ldeally, drains should not communicate with the oral cavity to prevent contamination of
subcutaneous tissue with opportunistic oral bacteria.
5. Absorbable monofilament of moderate longevity is often the suture of choice for suturing intraoral
lacerations. Poliglecaprone 25 (Monocryl, Ethicon, Inc., Somerville, NJ) is most commonly used (4-0 in
medium and large dogs and 5-0 in cats and small dogs).

b. Description: Trigeminal neurapraxia is a disease of the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve, which
results in flaccid paralysis or paresis of the muscles innervated by this branch. Unlike the maxillary or
ophthalmic branches of the trigeminal nerve, the mandibular branch contains both sensory and motor fibers.

TRAUMA-ASSOCIATEDMUSCULOSKELETALINJURY TO
THEAPPENDICULAR SKELETON
Stephen J. Mehler
1.EXTERNAL COAPTATION-PRINCIPLES OF BANDAGES, SPLINTS, AND SLINGS
 a. Principles of external coaptation:
i. Padding:
1. Comfortable.
2. Too much padding allows movement of fracture.
3. Too little padding allows for soft tissue injury (cast disease).
ii. Functions of a bandage/splint:
1. Protection of wounds
2. Absorption of draining material
3. Compression of soft tissue:
a. Limits dead space
b. Limits fluid accumulation (seroma, hematoma)
 4. Stabilization of fractures or underlying soft tissue injuries
ili. Forces that can be neutralized with a bandage/splint:
1. Bending
2. Rotation
3. Shear
4. Tension (as occurs with avulsion fractures such as fractures of the olecranon, greater trochanter, and
tibial tuberosity) is poorly neutralized by external coaptation:
 a. Internal fixation and a postoperative non-weight-bearing sling is best for these fractures.
iv. Reduction of the fracture:
1. Fracture reduction must be achieved before application of cast or splint.
2. General anesthesia is needed for fracture reduction.
3. Reduction is sufficient when cortical overlap of at least 50% is achieved and documented with
radiographs:
a. Perfect reduction should always be the goal.
b. If acceptable reduction cannot be achieved and maintained, then open reduction and internal fixation
is required.
v. Alignment of the fracture:
1. Perfect alignment of the limb must be achieved with closed reduction and external coaptation.
 2. Complications of imperfect alignment of the limb include:
a. Malunion:
1. Rotational
2. Angular
b. Gait abnormalities
c. Lameness
d.Secondary osteoarthritis

vi. The joint above and below the fracture must be immobilized when a bandage, splint, or cast is used:
1. Conventional casts and splints should only be used for fractures below the elbow and stifle.
2. Fractures of the humerus or femur should never be coaptated with routine bandages or splints.

management of limb edema secondary to surgery, inflammation, and lymphatic obstruction.
ix. Casts and splints:
1. Allow for weight-bearing.
2. Immobilize joints more so than a soft bandage.
3. Casts provide rigid immobilization of the limb and superior stability compared to splints and soft
bandages.
x. Factors that influence success of external coaptation include the following:
1. Owner compliance.
2. Patient compliance.
3. Patient temperament.
4. Failure to restrict the affected animals activity, failure to maintain a clean and dry bandage, and failure
to return for follow up bandage changes may lead to catastrophic complications.

 5. Compression of peripheral nerves leading to temporary or permanent dysfunction
6. Limb necrosis
7. Self mutilation
8. Muscle contracture
9. Loss of joint mobility and range of motion
b. Types of bandages, splints, and slings:
i. Bandages:
1. Robert-Jones (Figures 18.-2a and 18.-2b):
a. Bulk provides support.
b. Mild compression reduces swelling.
c. Excellent temporary support:
2. Postoperative to limit damage to the surgical site and to limit seroma formation.
d. Inadequate for primary stabilization:
1. Cotton padding loosens rapidly after application.
2. Loosening results in instability at the fracture site.
e. Uses include the following:
1. Fractures below the elbow and stifle.
2. Dislocations at or below the elbow or stifle.
f. Application principles:
1. Extends from mid-humerus/femur to toes.
2. Open wounds are covered with a nonadherent dressing after appropriate wound care.
3. Tape stirrups are applied:
a. This step is mandatory.
b. Prevents slipping of the bandage distally.
c. Use adhesive tape:
a. % inch for small dog or cat
b. 1 inch for medium to large dog

 any soft tissue injuries.
d. Stirrups should extend from above the carpus or tarsus to 6 inches beyond the toes
4. 12-inch roll cotton is unrolled:
a. Discard the paper insert.
b. Reroll the cotton.
c. Divide the roll into six inch halves.
5. Always begin at the toes when wrapping the limb.
6. Roll the cotton from the toes to the axilla or inguinal region.
7. Overlap the roll cotton 50% on itself as you proceed up the limb.
8. Leave the nails of the two middle toes exposed for evaluation (Figure 18.-2c).
9. Apply elastic gauze over the cotton:
a. Start with the toes and work proximally.
b. Apply with strong and even pressure.
c. Apply 2-3 layers.
d. If sufficiently compressed, the bandage should sound like a "ripe melon" when struck with a finger.
e. Invert the tape stirrups and apply them to the outside of the elastic gauze.
f. Apply elastic tape or flexible self-adherent wrap to cover the outside of the bandage.
10. Bandage care:
a. Observe toes for swelling at least twice a day.
b. Check the temperature of the toes.
c. Obse rve toes for abrasions.
d. Keep the bandage dry:
when brought back inside.
 b. Wet bandages rapidly lead to moist dermatitis and should be changed immediately.
e. Loosening:
a. Occurs within hours to days.

1. Applied after closed reduction of craniodorsal hip luxation.
2. Contraindicated in ventrocaudal luxation:
a. Promotes ventral and caudal translation of the femoral head.
4. Postoperative internal repair of some acetabular and femoral fractures.
f. Application:
1. Cast padding is wrapped around the metatarsus:
a. Prevents abrasions and skin necrosis.
 2. Elastic gauze is wrapped around the metatarsus and continued around the medial aspect of the stifle
joint:
a. The stifle and tarsus are maintained in a flexed position.
3. The gauze is continued over the cranial and lateral aspect of the stifle joint:
a. The gauze is placed as proximal as possible over the thigh.
4. Continue the gauze distally toward the hock, going behind the hock to the medial aspect of the tarsus,
then dorsally back over the metatarsals.
6. Elastic tape is placed over the gauze and overlaps onto the skin:
a. This helps keep the bandage in place.
7. If placed properly, there are no circumferential bands of material on the limb.
g. Bandage care:
following closed reduction of a cranial dorsal hip luxation.
3. Abrasions and pressure necrosis may develop over the cranial thigh and medial tarsus.
4. Check the toes daily for swelling.
5. Slippage of the sling from the stifle is the most common complication:
a.Very common in cats

caudal vertebra.
b. Each os coxae, also termed hemipelvises, are composed of the ilium, ischium, pubis, and the acetabular
bone.
d. The medial surface of the ilial body, also called the sacropelvic surface, articulates with the sacrum by way
of the sacroiliac joint:
i. The sacroiliac joint consists of a crescent-shaped synovial joint and fibrocartilaginous synchondrosis.
ii. This articulation allows primary weight transfer to the vertebral column.
e. The ischium is an irregularly shaped bone that forms the caudal aspect of the os coxae:
i. The caudolateral aspect of this bone is termed the ischiatic tuberosity.
ii. The sacrotuberous ligament, biceps femoris, semitendinosus and semimembranosus muscles have
origins in this region.
f. The prepubic tendon, which is composed of the tendinous sheaths of most of the abdominal musculature,

ii. Severity of injury:
a. Neuropraxia: Interruption of conduction down the nerve; can be associated with focal demyelination.
 Least severe lesion and often associated with return to normal to function.
b. Axonotmesis: Disruption of the neuronal axon but the surrounding supporting tissue remains intact.
More severe lesion but some patients can recover.
c. Neurotmesis: Disruption of the neuronal axon and surrounding supportive tissue. Most severe lesion

BITE WOUND TRAUMA
David Holt
1.INTRODUCTION
a. Bite wounds occur frequently in dogs and cats and account for a substantial part of the small animal
veterinarian's emergency caseload:
i. The true incidence of dog and cat bites is unknown but dog bite wounds were responsible for 10% of
canine admissions to an emergency service in one study (Kolata et al., (1974)).
b. In many cases, bite wounds cause substantial tissue injury and infection, and cause systemic inflammation
and sepsis.
c. This chapter will review the systemic and local effects of severe bite wounds and provide a plan for

2.SYSTEMIC EFFECTS OF BITE WOUNDS
 system vital for life.
b. Central nervous system:
i. Bite wounds penetrating the cranial vault can cause coma or death.
iil. Bite wounds affecting the cervical spinal cord can cause hypoventilation through injury to the nervous
c. Respiratory system:
i. Small perforations of the thoracic wall can cause a life-threatening open pneumothorax.
ii. Crushing injuries to the larynx or trachea can cause respiratory obstruction.
d. Cardiovascular system:
i. Lacerations of major vessels can cause severe hemorrhage.
ii. Detailed management of neurologic, respiratory, and cardiovascular emergencies is covered in other
chapters of this book (see Chapter 2: Triage and Primary Survey, Chapter 3: Shock in the Trauma Patient,
Chapter 6: Trauma-Associated Thoracic Injury, Chapter 7: Traumatic Brain Injury).
e. Systemic inflammation:
i. Systemic inflammation is often seen in animals with multiple, severe bite wounds.
ii. Initiating factors:
interaction of inflammatory, immunological, coagulation, and fibrinolytic cascades
Aa pallouoo Aal illensn sl ing asuodsan lenlloloisud aaiod e alleuou sl uoeueul g

of the following conditions are present: Tachypnea, tachycardia, hyperthermia, and leukocytosis or
Organ dysfunction (see Chapter 3: Shock in the Trauma Patient).
f.iocal inflammation serves several important roles in normal wound healing:
i. Vasoconstriction, activation of platelets, and the intrinsic and extrinsic clotting cascades facilitate clot
formation that minimizes blood loss in the wound area.
uoelposea leol aieinus pue semuied nuawaldwo pue uoeinseon aun pue 'sialaeid paieaoe

into the wound; and wound debridement and repair.
can result in systemic inflammation and sepsis. The local inflammation becomes systemic (SiRS) when the
inciting insult is overwhelming or local regulatory control of inflammation is lost.
iv. Large hematomas, remaining necrotic tissue, and bacteria will prevent migration of fibroblasts and
capillaries into the wound. Infected, devitalized tissue delays wound healing and serves as stimulus for
systemic inflammation. wound repair only occurs once the wound is debrided and cleaned. This allows for
fibroblasts and capillaries to migrate into the wound and form granulation tissue. The epithelium then
migrates from the wound edges.
v. Clinical relevance:
a. Wound healing will not progress past the "Inflammatory" phase until dead or infected tissue is removed.
systemic inflammation is removed.
d. Once the animal is stabilized, wounds should be debrided to remove dead or infected tissue and lavaged
contaminated, broad-spectrum, bacteriocidal antibiotics should be ad ministered parenterally (see below).
3.LOCAL TISSUE INJURY
a. Compressive and tensile forces are involved in the majority of dog and cat bite wounds:
i. Tensile forces result in avulsion of tissues from underlying structures:
a. Skin is often avulsed from the subcutaneous tissues.
b. Subcutaneous tissues are avulsed from muscle.
c. Muscles are avulsed from underlying bones:
i. Avulsion of muscles often results in hernias and muscle devitalization.
ii. Compressive forces can result in either puncture wounds, crushing injury, or both, depending on the
shape of the teeth:
fractures of skull, limbs, or the chest wall.
b. Crushing causes swelling, ischemia, and necrosis:

c. Clinical relevance:
i. All open bite wounds and the vast majority of closed bite wounds should be considered contaminated,
meaning that they contain bacteria, devitalized tissue, and sometimes foreign material. Untreated,
bacteria will rapidly proliferate and invade the tissues, resulting in an infected wound.
4.INITIAL MANAGEMENT OF THE BITE WOUND PATIENT
a. Initial management of an animal with bite wounds should proceed in a planned, orderly manner. The initia

aseptic conditions and should include the following:
i. Assessing the extent of the injuries.

S.INIURY ASSESSMENT
a. In an unpublished survey of 263 animals with bite wounds presented to an urban veterinary emergency
room during a one-year period, the most common wound sites were: 1. The limbs; 2. The head and neck; 3.
Regions over the thoracic and abdominal cavities; and 4. The perineal region (Parent C. Unpublished bite
wound survey, University of Pennsylvania, School of Veterinary Medicine, 1993). There are specific evaluation
and management concerns with wounds in each of these locations:

c.Head and neck wounds:
i.Bite wounds to the neck may result in cervical spinal fracture, luxation, or traumatic disc prolapse.
 Cervical spinal injury should be assumed and proper precautions should be taken to limit movement of the
neck until complete assessment is completed If spinal injuries are suspected (i.e., quadraparesis) or
documented the neck should not be manipulated and instead it should be stabilized (see Chapter 9:
Traumatic Spinal Injury).
 ii. Thorough evaluation for CNS and upper airway trauma should be performed.

d. Thoracic and abdominal wounds:
i. Both radiography and blunt probing of thoracic or abdominal wounds to determine body cavity
penetration are unreliable diagnostic tests:
a. In many cases, there is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, pneumoperitoneum, or peritoneal effusion
exploration
ii. The lateral and especially caudal abdomen is carefully palpated to rule out traumatic herniation of intra-
 abdominal contents (see Chapter 13: Trauma-Associated Body Wall and Torso Injury).
ii. The best method of assessment of these wounds is thorough surgical exploration.
e.Perineal
wounds:
catheter may aid in the identification of the urethra during wound exploration. Wounds in this region are
often severely contaminated with bacteria from the perineal skin. They should be treated as surgical
indicated to definitively rule out urethral trauma.
6.WOUND EXPLORATION, DEBRIDEMENT AND LAVAGE
a. Wound preparation:
i. Prior to clipping a sterile, water-soluble gel (K-Y Jelly, Johnson & Johnson) should be placed in the
 wounds to prevent further contamination.

damage often extends far beyond the visible wound.
il. Use of surgical scrub solutions in the wound itself controversial as bacteriocidal concentrations of both
 chlorhexidine diacetate (0.05%) and povidone-iodine (1%) are lethal to fibroblasts in vitro:
a. The benefits of removing dirt, debris and killing bacteria should be weighed against the risk of damaging
healthy tissue and impairing wound healing.

solution in the wound should be flushed immediately with balanced electrolyte solution.
b. Debridement:
i. Debridement is best performed with sharp dissection. Vital structures (nerves, tendons) should be
preserved wherever possible.

bacterial growth and could contribute to inhibition of healing and bacterial infection due to low oxygen
tension within devitalized tissue, which can impair bacterial killing by white blood cells.
v. Begin superficially and progress deeper into the wound.
vi. Tissue at each layer should be carefully assessed for viability before resection.
viil. All fat of questionable viability should be removed.
vili. Muscle viability can be determined by assessing bleeding at surgery.
c. Lavage:
i. Wounds should be copiously lavaged during exploration. The effectiveness of lavage is proportional to
the volume of solution used.
ii. Lavage fluid must be delivered under pressure to be effective:
b. Higher lavage pressures force bacteria deeper into a wound and open deeper tissue planes.
c. Lactated Ringer's solution or phosphate buffered saline has been shown to be less damaging to fibroblasts
 in vitro than normal (0.9%) saline.

1. The mesh should be covered with an omental pedicle flap mobilized through a separate flank incision.
c. Abdominal defects:
i. The cranial sartorius muscle flap can be used to reconstruct caudal abdominal wall defects.
 ii. Polypropylene mesh/omentum can be used for large abdominal wall defect repairs.
9.WOUND REPAIR
wo aw e sl leue 'spojad uaplos, e jo idaouo piay Aisnoaaid aul pasolo painins aq oi yanoua uealp auo
bacterial multiplication and invasion of the wound, the situation in many wounds, especially bite wounds,
cannot be simplified to a judgment based on time alone.
b. The surgeon must evaluate a wound for the amount of local tissue trauma that might compromise the
and the adequacy of the wound's blood supply before deciding on open or closed wound management.
Closure should be delayed if any doubt exists concerning the viability of tissue or amount of infection
remaining in the wound.
c. Primary closure:
i. Strict adherence to basic surgical principles is essential.
ii. Only healthy tissues should be present after debridement and lavage.
ili. Hemostasis must be excellent, as blood clots provide a superior medium for bacterial growth.
iv. Tissue layers should be gently apposed to minimize dead space.
v. Wounds should be tension free.
vi. If dead space is present:
a. Use one or more gravity-dependent, Penrose or closed suction drains (Figure 20.-1).

10.USE OF ANTIBIOTICS IN ANIMALS WITH BITE WOUNDS
a. The use of antibiotics in dogs and cats with bite wounds is poorly understood. There are few objective

either risk factors for bite wound infection, indications for antibiotic treatment in bite wounds, or the bacteria
causing true wound infections.
infection. There is one meta-analysis of randomized trials of antibiotics to prevent infection in humans with
dog bite wounds. This study (Cummings, (1994)) found the risk of infection in the control (nonantibiotic
treated population) was 16%; the relative risk for infection in the patients given oral antibiotics was 0.56 (95%
spite of the treatment, and in 7 the antibiotics will prevent infection.
c. Risk factors for infection in humans:
i. Full thickness puncture.
iil. Hand or lower extremity wounds.
ili. Wounds requiring surgical debridement or involving joints, tendons,ligaments, or bones.
iv. Patients with compromised immune function.
v. Patients with prosthetic implants.
d. Risk factor analysis for infection has not been performed for bite wounds in dogs and cats.
e. Culture studies in dogs:
i. Zimbabwe (87 dogs, aerobic cultures only) (Kelly et al., (1992)):
a.Staphylococcus intermedius (23%): 30% resistant to multiple drugs.
b.Escherichia coli (18%): Multiple drug resistance common.
c. Nonlactose fermenting coliforms (14%).
ii. University of Pennsylvania (37 dogs; cultures taken before and during surgery) (Griffin and Holt, (2001):
a.S. intermedius was the most common bacteria cultured.
b.Enterococcus was cultured more frequently than E. coli (11 vs 10 isolates in 37 cases).
c. Wide range of other aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were also cultured.
d. Antibiotic sensitivities were variable.
e. Neither the bacterial isolates nor the likely antibiotic sensitivity could be predicted with any accuracy prior
to the results of culture and sensitivity testing.
f. No one antibiotic could be relied upon to kill all bacteria in all wounds.
f. Clinical recommendations:
i. Antibiotic treatment is justified in clinically infected wounds and probably warranted in fresh wounds
ii. Antibiotics should not be used as a substitute for appropriate wound management.
ili. Given the uncertain flora and antimicrobial sensitivity in individual animals, cultures obtained at the
 time of surgical debridement is mandatory.
iv. Wounds with suspected postoperative infections should be re-cultured.
However, the latter combinations will not kill the majority of Enterococcus species, which are often
sensitive only to Ampicillin, Clavamox, Timentin, or Vancomycin.
vi. Editors note: If empiric oral antibiotic therapy must be chosen for dogs and cats with bite wounds, the
four most commonly cultured bacteria from bite wounds have been shown to sensitive to amoxicillin-
clavulonic acid (14 mg/kg PO q12 hours).
11.POSTOPerATIvE MaNaGEMeNT
a. The bite wound patient is monitored carefully and daily initially if it is severe. Tissues that appeared healthy
on initial inspection can progress to necrosis in spite of appropriate debridement and antibiotic therapy.

i. The ear is divided into three anatomical divisions: the external ear, middle ear, and inner ear.
iil. The external ear:
1. Pinna:
a. Variable shape depending on the breed
b. Formed by auricular cartilage
2. Vertical canal:
a. Funnel shaped
b. Formed by auricular cartilage
3. Horizontal canal:
venous blood drains into the maxillary vein:
a. Arterial blood supply is evenly distributed across the pinna and consists of three arteries: lateral
auricular artery, intermediate auricular artery, and medial auricular artery. The caudal auricular artery
provides the blood supply to the ear canal.

medial margins of the pinna.
ili. Middle ear:
 1. The tympanic membrane marks the division between the middle and external ear.
2. The middle ear primarily consists of the tympanic cavity, which is housed in an outpouching of the
temporal bone. The middle ear communicates with the nasopharynx via the auditory tube.
3. When sound waves strike the tympanic membrane, the vibration creates a ripple effect that is
transmitted, via the auditory ossicles within the middle ear (malleus, incus, and stapes), to the inner ear.
Unlike dogs, the feline tympanic cavity consists of two compartments, a larger ventromedial and a smaller
craniolateral compartment, which are separated by a bony septum.
iv. Inner ear:
Housed within the petrous temporal bone.
which contributes to hearing function.
b. Neural structures associated with the ear:
i. Cranial nerve Vll (facial):
Leaves the petrosal bone via the stylomastoid foramen.
Courses just ventral to the horizontal canal near the external acoustic meatus.
ii. Cranial nerve Vlll (vestibulocochlear):
1. Communicates with the tympanic cavity within the middle ear.
2. Damage to this nerve causes peripheral vestibular signs.
iii. Axons from postganglionic sympathetic neurons:
1. Course close to the wall of the middle ear in dogs and cats.
2. More exposed in cats, and thus more sensitive to traumatic damage.
3. Damage to these fibers can result in Horner's syndrome.
3.ETIOLOGY
accidents, nonaccidental physical injuries, bite wounds, rough play with other dogs, severe head shaking, and
surgical trauma.
21.-1):
i. Soft tissue injuries to the head have been detected in 35% of cases of trauma-induced injury (Kolata,
1975).
FGURE 21.-1

ii. Eleven percent of gunshot wounds are reported to be localized to the head (Fullington, 1997).
ili. Of injuries induced nonaccidentally, 19% are reported to affect the head (Munro, 2001).
4.DIAGNOSTICS
a. Physical examination:
i. Perform thorough examination of both concave and convex surfaces of the pinna.
iil. Palpation of the ear canal should be performed. Ear canal separation can be detected by palpating a loss
'ensn ueun allgou aou ag aeu ieuer lea aun 'alleuopps 'la
b. Otoscopy:

 ii. An abrupt ending to the vertical canal and inability to visualize the horizontal canal suggests a traumatic
ear canal separation.
c. Radiography:

 presence of middle and/or inner ear damage.
i1.
 Suggestive of middle ear disease include increased soft tissue opacity within the bulla as well as thickening
of the wall of the tympanic bulla.
d. Computed tomography (CT):
contrast and the ability to evaluate the middle ear in cross-section.
ii. CT is superior to MRI for diagnosing bony changes.
e. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):
 i. MRI is capable of detecting disease earlier than can radiographs or CT.
ii. MRl can visualize the inner ear including the semicircular canals, vestibule and cochlea.
5.TRAUMATIC AURAL LESIONS
a. Pinna trauma:
ssauniun lng anloui Aeu no 'alee sunajanun pue ulss aun 'auole ulss aun noae uen suoisal euud !
lacerations through both skin surfaces and cartilage.
ii. Indications for surgery to the pinna include severe lacerations or perforations and avulsions.
ii. As with any cutaneous wound, attention should focus on debridement of any necrotic tissue and
copious lavage with a sterile isotonic solution:
2. If the laceration results in a two- or three-sided flap, then surgery is recommended (Figure 21.-2):

and both skin layers and cartilage (c).
(a)
b. For wounds penetrating through the pinna, both the cartilage and skin on the convex surface should be
cartilage on the deeper bite and appose the skin on the more superficial bite). The skin on the other side
can be apposed with simple interrupted sutures (Figure 21.-2).
3. wounds that are located on the border of the pinna will require surgical correction, as wound
contraction and epithelialization in this area will often result in defects that are not cosmetically
acceptable to pet owners.
4. Partial pinna amputation:
a. Necrotic pinna tissue (both skin and cartilage) should be removed leaving healthy tissue to suture
together.
b. The exposed skin edges are sutured together using a 3-0 or 4-0 monofilament suture in a simple
continuous pattern.
 5. More extensive injuries may require full pinna amputation or a skin flap:
a. Skin flaps used in the treatment of pinna injuries generally come from the head or neck (e.g., caudal
auricular axial pattern flap).
b. Extensive injuries may require staged procedures over several weeks.
b. Aural hematomas:
i. The pathogenesis of aural hematomas has not been fully elucidated. A direct causal relationship
between trauma and aural hematomas has been questioned; however, many still believe that severe head
shaking and other forms of pinna trauma precipitate the development of aural hematomas (Kagan, (1983);
Dubielzig, 1984; Kuwahara, (1986)):
1. Fracture of the cartilage has been linked with hematoma formation (Dubielzig, 1984).

ii. Treatment:
1. Nonsurgical options:
a. Identify and treat the source of head shaking or ear scratching.
b. Needle aspiration of the hematoma can be attempted, but this is generally ineffective long term and is
associated with a high recurrence rate.
c. Systemic corticosteroids have been administered with variable success.
2. Cavity obliteration (Figure 21.-3):

i. A linear incision can be used for small hematomas.
ii. Curved incisions are preferred in animals with large hematomas to reduce the degree of ear
deformation resulting from contraction.
b. The cartilaginous cavity is explored, and the fibrin clumps are removed.
b.c. The cavity is flushed with sterile saline, and obliterated by proper suture placement (Figure 21.-3):
i. Place 3-0 to 4-0 monofilament nonabsorbable sutures about 1 cm from each other, oriented along the
long axis of the ear (parallel to the incision).
ii. Place full-thickness sutures in the area of the cavity and tie on the convex surface of the ear. Do not tie
tightly to allow for swelling.
ii. The incision is left open and a wide gap should be left at the dependent aspect of the hematoma to
encourage drainage.
3. Passive drainage (Figure 21.-3):
a. Teat cannula (Dr. Larson's'm, Spring Valley, Wl):
i. A stab incision is made with a scalpel blade at the most dependent section (neutral ear position) of the
aural hematoma cavity on the concave surface of the pinna.
ii. The cavity is flushed thoroughly with sterile saline and encouraged to drain via manual manipulation.
ii. A teat cannula is then placed into the stab incision and secured with 3-0 nylon to the skin.
iv. The ear is massaged gently on a daily basis, and the cannula is left in place for 3-4 weeks.
b. Penrose drain (Bard, Covington, GA):
i. Two stab incisions are made with a scalpel blade-one at the proximal aspect of the hematoma and one
at the distal aspect of the hematoma.
ii. The contents of the hematoma are removed, and the cavity is flushed thoroughly with sterile saline.
ii. A % inch Penrose drain is placed into one incision and out the other and secured to the skin with 3-0
nylon.
iv. These drains are generally kept in place for 2-3 weeks.

immediately.
c. Ear canal separations and abscessation:
i. Trauma may lead to ear canal separations that can develop para-aural abscessation.
ii. Separation occurs between the vertical and horizontal ear canals.
ii. Signs of para-aural abscessation include the development of draining tracts ventral to the horizontal ear
canal and para-aural swelling; however, reports of these cases have shown that the disease can remain
undiscovered for as long as several months after the traumatic episode.
iv. Diagnostics may include palpation, otoscopic examination, radiographs, and CT (see above).
v. In the literature, all cases have been addressed surgically, and the procedures utilized most commonly
McCarthy, 1995).
vi. The prognosis with surgery in these cases is favorable.
d. Peripheral vestibular disease:
i. Direct neuronal damage from fractures to the petrous temporal bone or tympanic bulla can result in
vestibular signs. In addition, abscessation secondary to ear canal separations or bite wounds may result in 
inner ear disease and subsequent signs of peripheral vestibular disorder may be noted.
ii. Clinical signs such as ataxia, head tilt, turning in tight circles, and/or horizontal or rotatory nystagmus
may be noted with trauma-induced peripheral vestibular disease. Signs of peripheral vestibular disease
should be differentiated from signs of central vestibular disease. Central vestibular disease may be a more
likely differential when vertical nystagmus, proprioceptive and postural reaction deficits, and deficits in
cranial nerves V, Vll, Ix-xll are present.
ii. One study reported that of 83 cases of peripheral vestibular syndrome, 7 (8%) occurred secondary to
trauma (Schunk, 1983).
Nausea can be treated with antihistamines or alpha-2 receptor antagonists. Cats tend to have a better
response to alpha-2 receptor antagonists than antihistamines.
a. Meclizine: 25 mg P0 q24h (dogs), 12.5 mg PO q24h (cats).
b. Diphenhydramine: 2-4 mg/kg PO, IM q8h (dogs, cats).
c. Chlorpromazine: 0.5 mg/kg IM, SC q6-8h (dogs, cats).
d. Maropitant: 1 mg/kg IM, 2 mg/kg PO q24h (dogs).
2. Keep pet in a padded area to prevent injury from falls due to ataxia.

e. Facial neuropathy:
i. The facial nerve innervates the superficial muscles of the head and face, including the auricular muscles

sensation to the concave portion of the external ear.

eyelid (ptosis), loss of blink, and/or keratoconjunctivitis sicca (Kcs).
ili. In a large retrospective study of animals with facial neuropathy, 14% of dog cases and 44% of cat cases
eiey pluiedoipiuou jo saser aut jo 'eunen leoidhnsuou jo iejlns oi epuonas snooo on nysnoun aiam
neuropathy, 55% and 58% of the cases of facial neuropathy were secondary to trauma in dogs and cats,
signs of vestibular disease (Kern, 1987).
dysfunction can be seen postoperatively. Twelve to 36% of dogs and 56-78% of cats have been shown to
develop facial nerve dysfunction after TECA surgery (white, 1990; Devitt, 1997; Bacon, 2003; Doyle, 2004).
v. With traumatic facial neuropathy, recovery of facial nerve function is dependent on the extent of injury.
Weeks to months may be required to see any improvement in signs. If avulsion or severance of the nerve
occurs, clinical signs are likely irreversible.
clinical signs at which point further diagnostics may be necessary. If kcs occurs, apply an artificial tear
immune-mediated condition, the use of cyclosporine will be of no benefit.
f. Horner's syndrome:
i. Sympathetic nerve fibers pass through the middle ear of dogs and cats and thus are susceptible to
trauma affecting this area.
 ii. Signs consistent with Horner's syndrome such as miosis, enophthalmos, protrusion of the third eyelid,
 and ptosis can be seen.
ii. Other reported causes of Horner's syndrome include intracranial lesions, otitis, cervical trauma or
myelopathy, brachial plexus injuries, thoracic trauma, and thoracic masses. In many older dogs with
Horner's syndrome, the condition may be idiopathic.
should be differentiated. Important differentiating features seen with traumatic uveitis include
pressures (see Chapter 15: Trauma-Associated Ocular Injury).
v. In one study, blunt vehicular trauma was the most common cause of Horner's syndrome in dogs and
brachial plexus injury (Kern, 1989).
due to increased exposure of the sympathetic nerve fibers, 42% of cats can develop Horner's syndrome
postoperatively (Bacon, 2003).
vii. As with facial neuropathy, treatment for trauma-induced Horner's syndrome consists of monitoring the
patient for worsening of clinical signs.
g. Hearing loss:
un sl slewjue uoueduon ul Ae Suueay aapn Alaalugap on pakoidua Alleaual pouiau aui !
brainstem auditory-evoked response (BAER):
Simply stated, the BAER test measures the recordings of activity in the vestibulocochlear nerve and the
auditory portion of the brainstem in response to sensory stimuli.
The hearing threshold can be determined by use of the BAER technique, and hearing loss can be noted
after trauma that affects this pathway.
ii. with tympanic membrane perforation, some hearing loss may occur:
2. In humans, it has been shown that damage to the ossicles of the middle ear results in more significant
hearing loss than when only the tympanic membrane is perforated.
