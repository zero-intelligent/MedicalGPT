Preface
Understanding disease is a challenging and complex process and different from diagnosing
pathogen involvement. Sophisticated molecular techniques are becoming available for a range
of infectious diseases and represent valuable tools; however, for disease diagnosis they
itself is a complicated biological system, and the disease process the result of interactions
between the agent, the host and the environment. An understanding of the normal structure and
function is important so that deviations from nomality that occur during disease are
recognised. A good pathologist should therefore possess knowledge in diverse disciplines
such as biology, genetics and physiology, parasitology, microbiology and immunology,
to mention a few.
Within aquaculture, fish farming has experienced a tremendous growth and is still devel-
oping rapidly with salmonid production being a rele vant component of this expansion, if not in
terms of tonnage, certainly in terms of its economic value. As with all intensification in animal
production, new diseases and diverse problems arise and represent diagnostic challenges,
economic losses and, importantly, animal welfare issues. In this scenario and in spite of all the
new techniques available, morphological pathology will remain the gold standard and cannot
be replaced in the initial stages of diagnostic work. In addition, fish are increasingly being used
 as experimental animals, and therefore knowledge of basic fish pathology remains important
for scientists.
It is our hope and intention that this book will increase the awareness and significance of
diseases and animal welfare of this iconic group of fish—the salmonids. We anticipate that fish
farmers, fish veterinarians and practitioners, hobbyists, anglers, policy makers and regulators
will find this book useful, and even for those not working with disease as their primary focus,
we believe that by understanding the pathological processes this can make their job more
rewarding. For the authors, fish pathology has been a life-long experience and passion,
something we hope a new generation of professionals will give continuity. The pathogen
diversity and new manifestations of disease makes it a very dynamic discipline and an all-
embracing art where there will always be something new to learm.

Introduction
Abstract
Global production of Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout continues to increase, however,
despite advances in prophylaxis and vaccines, disease outbreaks are one of the major
limiting factors for the production of farmed fish worldwide. Infectious agents can increase
rapidly in susceptible stocks, especially where the general health status of the population is
poor. Therefore, the maintenance of health and the accurate diagnosis of infection are of
major importance. This book (A Colour Atlas of Salmonid Diseases) represents our current
knowledge of infectious and non-infectious diseases affecting salmonids from the view of a
diagnostic pathologist. The reader can familiarise themselves with the wide range of
conditions that we consider as ‘abnormal' thus providing an invaluable guide to those

Functional Anatomy
Abstract
The microscopic examination of stained sections and the ability to interpret the relationship
between fine structure and function is essential. The recognition and interpretation Of
physiological and pathological processes requires a thorough understanding of normal
tissue structure and microanatomy, and importantly the variations within species are crucial
 for correct interpretation. This chapter covers the physiological changes, sexual maturation
and aging processes that are 'normal', and inherently different from those resulting from
injury, infection or disease.

Immature erythrocytes are known as reticulocytes, they are
rounder with a relatively larger nucleus. Five categories can
be recognized based on structure, distribution and quantity
of basophilic substances within their cytoplasm. Normally,
these represent about 1 % of the total count in healthy fish.
Lymphocytes in fish constitute 70-90 % of the total
number of leucocytes. Lymphocytes are arbitrarily separated
into categories of large (10-15 μm diameter) and small
(7-10 μm diameter), which may represent different func-
tional stages. The round or oval nucleus virtually occupies
the whole cell leaving a narrow margin of basophilic
cytoplasm. The cytoplasm may show pseudopodia-like pro-
jections on the surface. Both T and B lymphocytes forms are
recognised in fish, playing a most significant role in the
innate and the acquired immune responses.
Thrombocytes are responsible for blood clotting and are
important in homeostasis and defence. Typically they are

Monocytes form about 0.1 % of the circulating leucocytes
and are partially differentiated end cells which under appro-
 priate conditions will develop into mature cells of the mono-
nuclear phagocyte system. Monocytes are 9-25 μm in
diameter with a lighter staining cytoplasm than small
lymphocytes and contain small granules with a large
nucleus.
Differentiation of phagocytes into macrophages usually
takes place when they become extravascular, migrating from
the vessels into the tissues and therefore usually not seen in
circulation. Their phagocytic capability is well documented,
but resting macrophages in tissues are diffcult to distinguish
from fibrocytes in H&E stained sections.
2.2.2  Secondary Circulation
Fig. 2.14 Spleen in abdominal cavity of Atlantic salmon, note dupli-
cate organ in this case
 Studies indicate that fish lack a true lymphatic system but a
second vascular system derived from and connected to the
phatic and the secondary system have been noted and
observed in skin, fns, gills, oral mucosa and lining of the
peritoneum, however it remains to be determined whether
the secondary system is the antecedent of a lymphatic sys-
tem or a coincidentally similar structure.
The spleen is usually dark red or almost black in colour
and a discrete organ with sharply defined edges located near
the greater curvature of the stomach. A thin serous capsule
covers the surface. The spleen functions as a haematopoietic
organ, a temporary blood bank and as a remover of
circulating antigens and effete blood cells. Occasionally,
two or more spleens may be recorded and the organ may

In addition, grayling scales differ from those of other salmo-

A thin, cellular layer covers the entire scale and is distinct
from other epidermal tissues, the scleroblasts which are a

Unpaired fins are generally supported on small bones within
the musculature septa. The caudal fin is supported by a
greatly modified, posterior most caudal vertebrae, fattened
into an almost symmetrical plate against which the fexible
fin rays of the caudal fn articulate. The adipose fin located
between the dorsal and caudal fins, despite its name, has no
adipose tissue or bony support. A clearer idea of its role has
emerged with evidence of sensory function reported,
 suggesting it may act as a precaudal fow sensor, therefore
 its removal can be detrimental to swimming efficiency.

2.5
Excretory System
Salmon, like most fish, release their nitrogenous wastes
as ammonia and the gills play an important role by excret-
ing this compound through diffusion into the surround-
ing water. However the core of the excretory system
remains in the kidney, with primary functions performed
by filtering wastes from the blood to maintain the body
fuid levels, collect and excrete the waste products and
maintain pH.
2.5.1Kidney
The kidney comprises tightly fused units giving the appear-

ance of a single organ. The kidney is located retroperitone-
ally along most of the length of the body cavity, ventral to
the vertebral column and dorsal to the swim bladder. The
anterior section, also known as the cranial or head kidney is
composed entirely of haematopoietic and lymphoid tissue
(Fig. 2.21), while the posterior section has the excretory role
and the functional unit are the nephrons (glomeruli and
tubules) embedded in haematopoietic tissue (Fig. 2.22).
The typical nephron of salmonids living in fresh water is
characterized by a relatively large glomerulus that fills up
the Bowman's capsule (Fig. 2.23). From the latter, the renal
tubule begins with the short neck segment characterized by
low cuboidal epithelium with long cilia. This section is
divided into a frst segment with eosinophilic, cuboidal to
columnar epithelium with a distinct brush border, and a
second segment with a taller columnar epithelia and a

water and salts, therefore it needs to adapt to the extermal
water conditions. Accordingly, in the freshwater the fish is
hypertonic and the nephron must conserve salts and elimi-
nate excess water which enters the body through the gills.
Conversely, in the marine environment, the fish is hypotonic,
the urine produced is scant and contains various di- and
trivalent electrolytes as well as nitrogenous end-products.
The nephron must conserve water through a reduction in
urinary volume in order to prevent dehydration. This func-
tion is accomplished by a high glomerular fltration rate,
reabsorption of salts in the proximal tubules and further
concentration of the urine in the distal segment. Ammonia,
urea and monovalent electrolytes are mainly excreted
through the gills.

at the outermost region of the pulp and secrete dentin.
The presence of teeth does not imply chewing activity but
often have a role in grabbing and tearing food.
Although the histological structure of the alimentary
canal varies along its length, it is basically composed of
the following layers from inside out: mucosa, submucosa,
muscularis and serosa (Fig. 2.28). The mucosa comprises a
simple columnar epithelium with mucous cells; loose con-
nective tissue makes up its lamina propria, richly supplied
with blood capillaries. The submucosa supports the mucosa
and joints it to the underpaying muscle layer and is com-
posed of dense irregular connective tissue. The muscularis
mucosa is a thin layer of longitudinal smooth muscle and the
 serosa is effectively a sheet of the visceral peritoneum.
The mucosa of the pharynx consists of shallow folds of

muscularis is composed of a thick outer layer of circular
muscle and a thin layer of longitudinal muscle. Both layers
Of the muscularis are striated.
The oesophagus is a short, muscular thick-walled tube
with longitudinally arranged folds of mucosa to facilitate
swallowing and propulsion of food particles. At the entrance
to the oesophagus the mucosa contains many mucous cells
and taste buds. This region usually lacks a muscularis
mucosa, distinguishing it from the rest of the digestive tract.
In the stomach and intestine the stratum compactum is
located between the lamina propria and the muscularis
mucosa which is composed of dense collagen fibres. Eosino-
philic granular cells (EGC's) may be present and form a layer
at the inner and outer sides of this stratum and are considered
to be closely related to fish mast cells. This layer of EGC's is

Sensory System
Fish sensory systems include mechano, olfactory and taste
receptors, equilibrium, hearing as well as vision organs. The
olfactory sensory neurons give a sense of smell mediated by
specialized sensory cells of the nasal cavity (Fig. 2.38). For
the purpose of this chapter we will only refer to the mechano
reception, exemplified by the lateral line and vision systems,
as the most important regions for tissue pathology and
infection.

plexus of the eye, and communicates with the lumen of
the third ventricle. On the dorsal side of the diencephalon is
the pineal gland (epiphysis). This is a well vascularised
non-image forming photoreceptor structure, located under
a thin non-pigmented area of the skull that permits light to
reach the structure ('pineal window'). This structure can
detect alterations in ambient light (decreasing light in fall,
increasing light in the spring) and is of importance for
regulation of seasonal physiology such as smoltification.

Abstract
of the tissue changes that occur following infectious and non-infectious conditions. Cells
 have a limited repertoire of morphological response to injury which is linked to biochemi-
cal mechanisms that determine the outcome of cell damage, thus accounting for the
appearance of cells within lesions inducing general pathological changes, rather than
those that are pathognomonic. This chapter covers the different types of cell and tissue
responses to acute or chronic injury.

attributed to a deficiency of haemoglobin in the blood and/or
a decrease in the number of erythrocytes. Anaemia may
result from a decrease in red blood cell production, an
abnormal blood loss or the excessive breakdown of red
blood cells (Fig. 4.21). The most useful classification of
such deficiencies  is  based  upon  pathophysiological
mechanisms. A haemolytic anaemia is characterised by the
accumulation of haemosiderin (Fig. 4.22), with an increase
in the rate of destruction of erythrocytes and a corresponding
release of immature blood cells to the circulation, e.g. infec-
tion by Listonella anguillarum and infectious salmon
anaemia virus. Hypoplastic anaemia results from the failure
of the haematopoietic tissue to produce adequate numbers of
cells or a deficiency in haemoglobin synthesis, e.g. malnu-
trition. A haemorrhagic anaemia occurs as a result of bleed-
ing and is evident in conditions including viral haemorrhagic
septicaemia.
Haemorrhage is caused by injury to the vascular endothe-
lium and can attributed to infection, infammation, necrosis,

ally any tissue and are classified partly from the recognition
of the parent tissue, but largely from their microscopical
structure. Histological features are extremely useful in deter-
mining whether the lesion is benign or malignant. Benign
neoplasia shows a homologous tissue type, uniform cut
surface, lack metastases and cell atypia. Malignant neoplasia
conversely shows infiltration with a heterologous tissue type
compared to parent tissue, often with a variable cut surface
including haemorrhage and necrosis. Metastases and atypia
are common with a prominent nucleolus, irregular cell size

of both benignancy and malignancy. For more detail please

Viral Diseases
Abstract
Some viral diseases are prevented through vaccination but for many no vaccines are
available hence infection is a major concerm for farmed fish. Among salmonids, RNA
viruses have the greatest ecological and socio-economic impact. Acute infections may lead
to host death, or induce a more chronic condition. Stress including overcrowding, sexual
maturation and handling may also reactivate a latent infection resulting in clinical disease.
This chapter covers a range of viral diseases in wild and farmed salmonids.

the tissue has a loose appearance in stained sections. In the gut,
some apoptotic cells are noted within the mucosal intestinal
epithelium (*McKnight’ cells),with sloughing combined with
excess mucous to form a haemorrhagic exudate (Fig. 5.4).
An increase in eosinophilic granular cells in the granulosum
layer of the intestinal wall can be recorded. Pancreatic and
hepatic tissues may be infltrated by macrophages and poly-
morphonuc lear leucocytes. Involvement of the liver has been
documented as a feature of IPN, with early changes described
as fne vacuolation or vesicles within individual hepatocytes.
Progressively the vacuolation becomes widespread, particu-
larly towards the extermal edge of the hepatic cords and indi-
vidual lobules, and mirrored by an increase in apoptotic figures
(Fig. 5.5). Apoptotic bodies are phagocytised by neighbouring

Outbreaks of ISA occur in sea water or in hatcheries where
sea water is mixed with fresh water for pH or adjustment to
enhance smoltification. Under experimental conditions, sea-
run brown trout can harbour and transmit the virus. Most
new outbreaks have occurred in connection with rapid
changes in temperature during the spring and to some extent
in the autumn. Importantly, salmon stocks show large varia-
tion in their susceptibility to the virus.

stocks. Other salmonid species are susceptible to OMV
including coho, chum, kokanee and rainbow trout with
high mortality in young fish.
Affected fish are dark, frequently showing severe
exophthalmia and petechial haemorrhage under the lower
jaw and along the ventral surface. Epithelioma around the
mouth (upper and lower jaw), and, to a lesser extent, on the
caudal fin, operculum and body surface occur progressively
(Fig. 5.14). A white mottled appearance of the liver,
progressing to a pearly white colour of the whole organ is
recorded. A pale kidney and a multifocal, severe necrosis of
the liver are also common. Gill epithelial cells become
swollen and slough. There is a marked splenomegaly with
associated necrosis of the ellipsoids and the digestive tract is
generally devoid of food.

and sensitive tool for the quantitative diagnosis of HRV in
fish samples. Further work is required to assess if the virus is
spreading and its potential impact on farmed fish.

Evidence shows that SAV represents an atypical and new
member of the genus Alphavirus within the family
Togaviridae. Currently six subtypes have been described,
and all of them affects sea water salmon (SAV 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

Erythrocytic inclusion body syndrome (EIBS) is one of a
number of intraerythrocytic inclusion viruses which has

incidences are from sea water stock but also reported from
freshwater fish.

Bacterial Diseases
Abstract
 Bacterial infections comprise true obligate and opportunistic facultative pathogens. The
distinction between 'primary',* facultative′ or 'opportunistic′ cannot be taken too strictly as
the virulence of the agent will determine its ability to overcome the host defences. Bacterial
diseases are largely represented by Gram negative organisms and affect salmonids in fresh,
sea water or both. A few important diseases of salmon and trout, both in fresh and sea water
 are caused by Gram positive bacteria. This chapter covers a wide range of bacterial diseases
representing acute, chronic, systemic or localised infections affecting salmonids in fresh
and sea water.

Histologically, fish exhibit degeneration of kidney
tubules, with oedema in the renal interstitial tissues and
proteinaceous casts within the tubular lumen. Other changes
include a heterophilic cellulitis and myo-degeneration.
Isolates of the bacterium from intermal organs are Gram
negative, non-motile rods, catalase negative, and on the
basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis are classified
into species of Chryseobacterium, with the proposed name
of C. piscicola sp. nov., but followed by C. viscerum sp. nov.
The differential diagnosis is Flavobacterium psychrophilum.

Piscirickettsia salmonis is the causative agent of salmonid
rickettsial septicaemia (SRS) or piscirickettsiosis, and
recognised as a serious pathogen primarily in farmed stock
reared in sea water, with occasional outbreaks among rainbow
trout reported in fresh water from Chile. In other countries
outbreaks have had less significance. Clinical signs of SRS
generally include lethargy, swimming near the surface with
erratic movements and dark skin colouration. Raised scales
with associated haemorrhagic skin lesions can be observed.
Some fish may nevertheless appear normal. At necropsy, gills
show anaemia and intemally, ascites, splenomegaly, cream-

 Organisms play a role in the pathogenesis, extracellular
products, T cells or apoptosis may also be involved in the
development and pathogenesis of RTGE. Ultrastructural
changes included loss of microvillar structure, membrane
blebbing, hydropic mitochondrial damage and basal
hydropic degeneration of enterocytes. The exposure of
large areas of the lamina propria probably results in a
compromised osmotic balance and facilitates the entry of
other pathogens. The examination of fresh material
(Fig. 6.54) and molecular methods have helped to detect a
low number of bacteria, but further studies will be required
to establish the link between C. arthromitus and RTGE.

Red Mark Syndrome = Cold Water
Strawberry Disease
 Red mark syndrome (RMS) is a skin condition affecting
farmed rainbow trout and was first recorded in Scotland in
2003. Distinct lesions with single to multifocal reddish
coloured patches, particularly over the fanks and generally
below the lateral line are reported. Lesions vary in size from
a few millimetres to ~4 cm across and are frequently devoid
of scales in the centre. The absence of scales likely
contributes towards the susceptibility to mechanical damage
and occasionally, lesions become ulcerated after normal
farming practices. No behavioural changes have been
associated to the condition. RMS currently affects trout
farmed in the UK, USA and some regions of continental
Europe, with reports from Switzerland, Austria, Germany
and France.

the basal membrane and between the stratum compactum
and the underlying adipose tissue, with degeneration and
necrosis of the connective tissue. Less frequently, epidermal
involvement with lymphocytic infiltration and multifocal

has been observed in healing lesions. Changes in intemal
 organs such as renal degeneration, focal liver necrosis or
infammatory lesions including heart, intestinal smooth mus-

fish. However, feld cases could represent mixed conditions
where the changes in the intermal organs and association
with RMS remain to be proven.

and named strawberry disease (SD-USA). Recently, a case
definition decided that SD-USA assimilates to RMS and
should be referred to as 'cold water strawberry disease',
while the former SD-UK is recognised as *warm water
strawberry disease', thus differentiating the conditions
by the temperature window range and avoiding further
confusion. Currently RMS is diagnosed through light
microscopy.

Fungal and Related Oomycete Infections
Abstract
The oomycetes (fungal-like) occur as primary and secondary agents of infection among
wild and farmed salmonids in fresh and sea water. These infections can prove fatal, at least
for farmed fish, if preventative measures are not undertaken. Molecular sequencing has
improved our understanding of the phylogenetic relationships within this taxonomically
diverse group with current evidence indicating these organisms evolved from simple
holocarpic marine parasites. This chapter covers the commonly encountered oomycetes
infections in salmonids.

Abstract
The Protists are a large group of eukaryotic microorganisms with a taxonomy that is under
constant revision. Molecular studies show the group includes diverse and sometimes
distantly related phyla that share relatively simple levels of organization that can be
unicellular or multicellular, but without specialized tissues. In fish, Protists range from
true parasites that may cause significant mortality, to those that show commensalism.
 Conditions such as overcrowding or poor water quality, as well as other changes in
environmental conditions may allow parasites to rapidly increase in number and as a result
fish become vulnerable to infection with an increased chance of invasion by secondary
pathogens. This chapter presents a selection of the most common Protists reported from
 salmonid species.

This is followed by epithelial hypertrophy and stratification
of epithelia at lesion surfaces, with recruitment of mucous
cells to affected areas, reduced chloride cells and the for-
mation of large interlamellar lacunae or vesicles. Small to
medium sized lacunae may contain amoeba, whereas larger
lacunae are generally clear of any cellular debris (Fig. 8.3).
Very similar gill lesions associated with amoeba infections
on brook trout reared in freshwater, have also been reported
(Fig. 8.4). Proactive treatment by freshwater bathing is
carried out when gross gill assessment (ie. a gill score)
indicates a moderate level of infestation in a population.
However, re-infections have been reported at 2 weeks post
bathing. During the post-bath period, non-AGD lesions
 including haemorrhage, necrosis and regenerative hyper-
plasia have been observed.
 Paramoeba can be detected from wet preparations of gill
tissue, although subsequent histological examination is
recommended to improve diagnostic accuracy. Histologi-
cally, hyperplasia, lamellar fusion, vesicles or lacunae, fat-
tened epithelial cells ('pavement cells') and the presence of
amoeba form the basis of a diagnosis. Species identification
requires molecular testing using a quantitative duplex real-
time PCR. Differential diagnosis includes other Protists,

Spironucleus salmonis, previously known as Hexamita

weakness, anorexia and emaciation. Intermally, enteritis,

Metazoa
Abstract
 Metazoa parasites are multicellular organisms where cells have differentiated into organised
tissues and organs. These parasites may be found in all fish organ systems both in wild and in
farmed salmonids, in fresh and sea water. Recently, parasites that would have been included
as Protists are now considered metazoans, as the case of Myxozoa. The use of molecular tools
are able to identify many Metazoan parasites and 12S ribosomal DNA primers have signifi-
cant potential for metagenetic analysis, but should not detract or replace traditional histology
to asses their impact on the host. In this book we have used the term infestation to represent
ectoparasitic conditions and infection, as refeming to those that are endoparasitic. This
chapter will cover a selection of the many species of Metazoa that can be found in salmonids.

During the life cycle, actinospores are discharged from an
annelid host into the water and penetrate the skin of the fish
intermediate host. The sporoplasm develops into pres-
porogonic stages and eventually will locate in the bile
ducts where the sporogonic stage, plasmodium develops.
The cytoplasm of these large worm- or sac-like structures
is filled with many cell types including sporogonic cells and
pericytes. These develop into sporogony (spore formation),
and subsequently into sporoblasts and myxospores.
Histological examination reveals dilated bile ducts and
excretory canals with characteristic worm-like plasmodia
flled with sporogonic cells and spores (Fig. 9.7). Diagnosis
is based upon the examination of wet mounts or tissue sections,
the identification of typical plasmodia and crescent shaped or
 fusiform spores and polar capsules at opposing ends.

9.1.6  Myxobolus cerebralis
Myxobolus cerebralis is the causal agent of a persistent and
economical important condition termed ‘'whirling disease*
(WD). The parasite has been identified from farmed and wild
Pacific and Atlantic salmon, but within farmed species this is
mainly a problem in trout reared in earthen ponds. Clinical
signs include spiralling (*whirling behaviour'), darkening of
the caudal region and severe skeletal deformities of the
cranial area, jaw and opercula (Figs. 9.8 and 9.9) The
whirling behaviour is often pronounced when the fish
attempt to feed or when the fish are startled. Erosion of the
cartilage surrounding the auditory organ is reported to con-
tribute to the whirling. Infection of the cartilage of the spinal
column causes pressure on the caudal nerves resulting in loss
of control of caudal dermal melanophores. Infections cause a
significant pathology usually in the first 34 months after
fish start feeding and before ossification is complete. Matur-
ing stages lyse and digest chondrocytes thus disrupting oste-

infections are unlikely to result in a clinical complication.

128
Fig. 9.9 Skeletal deformity in brook trout following infection with Myxobolus cerebralis
Spores are released from the cartilage after death of
the fish where they are ingested by an intermediate host,
the oligochaete Tubifex tubiffex, in which they localize in the
intestinal epithelium and develop into the triactinomyxon
stage. Re-infection in the fish host may occur through the
 skin and buccal cavity. Trophozoites migrate through the
epidermis or gut lining and peripheral nerves to reach
the cranial cartilage. In rainbow trout successful develop-
ment of the parasite only occurs in sac fry which are older
than 2 days. Trophozoites induce necrosis either directly or
indirectly and lysis in the cartilage of the head and vertebrae.
As ossification proceeds, there is an interruption of osteo-
genesis resulting in permanent cranial and other skeletal
deformities. Trophozoites may also enter the labyrinth, caus-
ing damage and subsequent behavioural changes such as loss
of balance. Although some fry die before any signs of WD
are recorded, in most cases the course of the disease is

The Nematoda comprise numerous species of unsegmented

infection causes a variable but generally not extensive
pathology, although more prominent where the parasite is

intestine and rectum. Histologically, a multi-layered cuticle
which can be omamented with ridges is recorded. The hypo-

plerocercoids are found free or encysted on the viscera or in
the musculature, where they can burrow deeply. Commonly,
the plerocercoids trigger a granulomatous encystment on the
viscera, with a dense fbrous coat incorporating fbroblasts,
macrophages and collagenous tissue, and adhesions between
viscera and the abdominal wall can be observed. In the
muscle block plerocercoids may also cause granulomas,
haemorrhage and necrosis with cavitation, negatively affect-
 ing the swimming ability of the fish. Plerocercoids are long
lived in the fish intermediate host and will therefore accu-
mulate in older fish that typically develop the most severe
lesions. Piscivorous birds or mammals are fnal hosts where
reproduction occurs in the gut.
When fish are the final host, adult worms are typically
found attached by their scolex to the intestinal mucosa of
the pyloric caeca and hindgut. Cestoda lack a digestive system

In this case the parasites have penetrated the gut wall
through the whole body surface. The strobila is composed of
individual proglottids where each segment contains a single
set of reproductive organs. The proglottids with fertilized
eggs are shed from the posterior end of the parasite as
they mature. Eggs are shed with the faeces and hatch in
water to release a motile coracidium which in turm is eaten

9.3.1 Eubothrium spp.
Eubothrium crassum and E. salvelini are the most abundant
species of this genus and different species of salmonids may
act as intermediate or fnal hosts. E. salvelini has been
detected in rainbow trout, char, brook trout, Pacific and
Atlantic salmon, while E. crassum has been found in

As adult parasites, the scolex is embedded in the pyloric
caeca, while the conspicuous whitish, segmented strobila
may extend through most of the intestine. Adult E. crassum
may reach a length of 1 m, while E. salvelini seldom
exceeds 30 cm. Both species can occur in considerable
numbers in wild and farmed fish in fresh and sea water
and may almost occlude the gut lumen (Fig. 9.27) with
resultant loss of performance, emaciation and death.
When present in large numbers, the parasites may also
perforate the gut wall and end up in the peritoneal cavity
(Fig. 9.28). Heavy infection has been shown to impair salt-
water adaptation of migrant sockeye salmon. Fish are
infected by ingesting infected copepods or small fish.

Trematoda
Trematodes are fat and broad unsegmented helminth worms
with two suckers, one anterior and a ventral adhesive sucker.
Worms vary in size, from invisible to the naked eye to some
fairly large individuals. With a single exception trematodes
are hermaphroditic and oviparous, laying operculated eggs.
They have a complex life cycle involving developmental
stages (sporocysts and redias) in a mollusc (frst intermediate

capsular rupture and detachment of the retina may impair
host vision. This occurs as results of the active migration of
cercaria to the anterior chamber, retina, vitreous body and
lens, mostly through subcutaneous connective tissue and
skeletal muscle of the trunk (Fig. 9.36). The site of entry
is marked by tiny capsular perforations through which corti-
cal lens fibres exude. These perforations can lead to lens
rupture and severe endophthalmitis, and a generalised corti-
cal liquefaction as the fukes migrate to the anterior cortex
with the consequent proliferation of the lens epithelium.

species are oviparous, but some, including Gyrodactylus

decline in overall condition of the fish.
Acanthocephalans (spiny-headed worms) are characterised
by the presence of an evertable proboscis in the anterior part
of the body, armed with rows of chitinous spines, which
they use to hold the gut wall of their host (Fig. 9.45).
Acanthocephalans have complex life cycles involving at
least two hosts, including invertebrates, fish, amphibians,
birds and mammals. Infection can alter the intermediate
host behaviour, morphology and other features that enhances
the probability of transmission to the definitive hosts. The
adaptation to a parasitic life style resulted in a drastic sim-
plification of their morphology, they have a cylindrical non
segmented body and their general cavity is a pseudoccelom.
The muscular, excretory and nervous systems are greatly
reduced and they lack respiratory and circulatory systems
as well as an alimentary canal, thus nutrient uptake occurs

Table 9.2 Laxe-Luus'
Peder Clausson Fris (1545-1614) and Erik Pontoppidan (1698-1764) were a great scholar and bishop respectively
in Norway, and both showed a great interest in biology and natural history. They are probably the first to describe
sea-lice in migrating salmon. Fris (ca.1600) accurately describes the parasite without naming it: 'sage strax op i

Later, Pontoppidan in 1753 states that da den i store Flokke kommer fra Havet og soger op i Elverne, dees for at

of parasite numbers trigger a treatment, to help diminish
infestations and this is supplemented with cleaner fish to
remove lice (wrasse species and lumpsucker). However, atyp-

species can harbour viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus.

Argulus coregoni, A. foliaceus
and A. japonicus
Members of the Argulidae represent the freshwater
counterparts of sea lice and infest the skin and fns of
numerous fish worldwide, including Atlantic salmon, trout,
whitefish and grayling. These parasites have a preoral stylet
that causes local mechanical injury and particularly the
release of digestive enzymes. They are common on wild
fish and can cause severe losses in pond culture and inland
sport fisheries.
Argulus coregoni is the largest of the three species and
measures up to 13 mm in length (Fig. 9.53). The anterior part
of the body is covered by an oval semi-transparent carapace.
The feeding activity causes intense irritation and affected

occurs around entry wounds and haemorrhage with a se vere
infammatory response involving lymphocytic infltration,
typically follow. Due to their size and characteristic shape,
these parasites are easily diagnosed on gross examination of
fns and skin.
Argulus foliaceus can have a significant impact on yield
in recreational trout fisheries, partly by increasing losses but
also by reducing the appetite of infected fish, making them
less likely to react to bait.
A. japonicus has spread worldwide from its original Far
East habitats through the movement of fish. These obligate
ectoparasites feed on mucus, epidermal cells, blood and

Abstract
 Production related diseases and disorders cover a large area that the authors believe
deserves increased attention, although for some areas we cannot cover the subject in
great depth. These refer to a wide range of conditions that may or not be attributed to a
biological agent with examples discussed in this chapter covering environmental related
conditions, vaccination, developmental and congenital abnormalities and disorders, dietary
imbalance, disorders affecting the heart and the eye, general skeletal abnormalities, and 
 deformities among eggs and fry and predators.

 Salmonids are, in principle, carmivores with a relatively short
digestive tract and essentially identical, although slight
modifications exist between species. Growth, food intake,
stomach evacuation rate and feed efficiency ratio of Atlantic
salmon are influenced by temperature and fish size. However,
farmed and wild fish face very different challenges in relation
to their nutrition. The former have a fairly continuous access
to a dry pelleted feed throughout their life cycle and
overfeeding results in overweight fish (Figs. 10.8 and 10.9).
Conversely wild fish experience extreme variations in avail-
ability, quantity, quality and composition throughout the year 
and overweight wild fish are not observed. The composition
and quality of pelleted feed is generally high, but scarcity of
fish meal protein has resulted in their gradual replacement by
plant components imposing a challenge to the feed
manufacturers and to the fish. Quality control and customer
 demand have resulted in appropriate nutritional balanced diets

in the diet are possible causes.
Salmon fed on diets rich in proteins from soybean can
 develop a non-infectious sub-acute enteritis affecting the
distal intestine. Lesions include thickening of the lamina
propria due to infiltration of macrophages, neutrophils,
eosinophilic granular cells, loss of the normal supranuclear
vacuolization of the absorptive cells in the intestinal epithe-
lium and widening and reduction in height of the intestinal
folds (Fig. 10.14). Absorption from the gut is reduced due to
loss of apical vacuoles in epithelial cells. Lesions develop
faster at 12 °C than at 8 °C and are generally resolved within
a few weeks after removal of the soy bean components from
the diet.
10.3.6 Vitamin Deficiencies
Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is an essential dietary requirement
which deficiency results in an impaired biosynthesis of col-
lagen and chronic reduction of the supporting tissues, giving
rise to a typical kyphosis, lordosis or scoliosis (Figs. 10.15

 Keratitis may result from physical, nutritional, chemical

by an infectious agent. This is fairly common with systemic

Egg incubation temperature has been linked to shortened
opercula in salmonids. Shortened opercula are thickened
with excess mucus along the trailing edge and implies
reduced capacity of the buccal pump and consequently
interferes severely with normal breathing. In severe cases
the fish is obliged to swim constantly in order to move water
over the gills. Furthermore, the fish will be unable to
'cough', ie. reverse the water fow over the gills in order
to remove debris, particles or parasites. Exposed gills are
also more vulnerable to damage and infection by bacteria,
fungi and parasites.
Mechanical damage to the opercula may result from fish
jumping and hitting the bird net over the cages (particularly
salmon). The fish struggle to get loose resulting in severe

in farmed Atlantic salmon
 Jaw (mandible) deformities have been documented in wild
fish but frequencies are greater in hatchery populations.
Deformities can affect both the maxilla and/or the mandible,
resulting in a short or long lower jaw deformity. The latter can
also be displaced laterally. These abnormalities can be induced 
during embryonic and post-embryonic periods of life and are
often lethal with over 80 % of the affected larvae dying.
Further causes of deformities have been attributed to a
genetic or environmental origin, the result of adverse envi-
ronmental changes, phosphorous deficiency, excessive carti-
lage deposition and physical injury.

Congenital Malformations
Congenital malformations occur in both wild and farmed
progeny of salmonid fish and different types may occur
simultaneously in the same fish. Examples include hypopla-
sia of the swim bladder, absence of pyloric caeca and
incorrectly placed liver and/or spleen (Fig. 10.43). In wild
populations, fry with malformations typically die early,
while they may survive for a while under the protected
farming environment. The prevalence is generally low
Fig. 10.44 Anopthalmia in farmed Atlantic salmon
different parents. Most malformations are believed to be
the result of genetic factors and aberrations, sometimes
combined with unsuitable environmental factors during
embryonic development, like hypoxia, stress factors and
infections. It is difficult or impossible to determine the
exact interrelationship between the different aetiologies
and to pinpoint one particular cause. Embryogenesis is a
complex process and abnormally developed individuals
will seldom be visible before hatching. Variation in egg
size, discolouration, pseudo-albinism, twins, and duplication
 of heads and tails typically become evident at hatching. Uni-
or bilateral anopthalmia (Fig. 10.44) and abnormally small
eyes (micropthalmia) are also considered to be of genetic
origin. Several skeletal malformations, localized dysplasia
and enlarged, duplicated or absent fns are examples of
conditions with presumed genetic origin (Fig. 10.45).

resulting in a condition known as *white heart'. Affected fish
may display severe exophthalmia, ascites and even protru-
sion of the heart through a hermia in the ventral part of the
pericardium. The condition has occured in several
hatcheries and few, if any, fish survive to the sea water
phase. The cause(s) of the condition is unknown.

Ventricular cysts are epithelial lined, benign and observed in

usually originate from the edges of the ventricle and are
filled with a clear fuid. At least for farmed stock the cause
is considered to be related to high temperature during incu-
bation of the eggs.
10.11 Predators
Both famed and wild salmonids are subject to predator
damage from birds, otters, mink, seals, bears, other fish
and anthropogenic activity. Out-migrant wild smolts are
vulnerable to predator attacks as are farmed smolts recently
transferred to sea water. In many small rivers and creeks, up
migrant fish are also frequently attacked by predators.
Wounds inficted by birds such as cormorants, herons,

Idiopathic Diseases
Abstract
 Diseases with uncertain or compound aetiology occur in fish farming and defined as those
where the aetiology is unknown, or idiopathic. However, this may be difficult to ascertain
and furthermore many different conditions may occur concurrently with more well-defined
diseases, such as those with an infectious aetiology. It is characteristic for many idiopathic
diseases that they may not be lethal themselves, but when they affect an immuno-
compromised fish or occur with other agents, they may cause clinical disease and
associated mortality. Similarly, the transition between production-related disease and
infectious disease can be obscure.

Neoplasia

Abstract
A neoplasm represents an altered process involving abnormal and uncontrolled growth of
 cells that is usually detrimental to the host. Neoplasm are classified as benign or malignant
and named according to the features of differentiation recognised through histological
examination, thus refecting the tissue of origin. Neoplasia can arise following exposure to
certain chemicals, heavy metals, ionizing radiation, chronic infammation, ultraviolet radia-
tion, certain viruses and pollution. The chapter covers a selection of reported neoplastic
conditions affecting fish although overall, many of the cause(s) have not been determined.

 Normal squamous, or sometimes hyperplastic epithelium
covers the surface of the mass with some occasional
invaginations into the underlying stroma with increased
 mucous cell activity. Within the dermis, there is hypertro-
phy and some hyperplasia. Many of these growths contain
a number of cystic spaces beneath the epidermis and are
surrounded by a loose fibrous matrix of adipose tissue
containing strands of immature cartilage (Fig. 12.4).
Melanin granules are evenly spread throughout the dermis
with no evidence of infammation, infltrative growth or
distant metastasis. Chondrocytes are infrequent with no
mitotic figures.

Fibrosarcoma
Fibromas and fibrosarcomas are masses of me senchymal cell
origin that are composed of benign and malignant fibroblasts
and are usually found as nodular, well-defined lesions on or
near the body surface. These masses are soft (myxomas)
with a smooth, pale cut surface. Fibroblasts of variable
