Preface to the sixth edition
The BSAVA Smalf Anima! Formulary enters its sixth edition with a
new Editor-in-Chief and a new look. In the three years since the last
edition there has been a considerable change in the classification of
medicines. The details of this are presented in the Introduction and
the new classification is used throughout. However, many of the
drugs listed in the Formulary still remain unauthorized for the species
we treat.Authorized products should always be considered first for
every patient. If unauthorized drugs are to be used ahead of a
authorized product there must be a clear and definable clinical
preferred to another.
Another new development is the inclusion in the monographs of
information on specific handling requirements or human safety
issues. Comments on the general handling of all drugs, including best
dispensing practice, have been included in the Introduction. I urge all
continuing legal authority to dispense medications depends on a
demonstrably responsible attitude to pharmacy practice.
The BSAVA Smalf Anima! Formulary should never be the only source
of information that is consulted by veterinary surgeons and nurses
The format of the Formulary does not allow a detailed discussion of
series of Manuals published by the BSAvA, should be consulted as
well. The Formulary is designed as an aide memoire for drugs with
which readers are already partly familiar. A list of further reading is
provided in this Formulary.
Many of the drug uses, doses and adverse reactions that are
recorded in this Formulary are taken from textbooks, which in turn
have taken their information from a detailed analysis of the peer-
reviewed literature. However, some information is less clear or less
species. Some information is derived from unreferenced sources,
from well referenced sources with independent corroboration. This
nirvana will not be achieved for many years, if ever. Therefore, the
authors of the Formulary are now providing references for many of
the drugs. This information, which will gradually be provided on the
web-based version of the Formulary but not in the paper copy, will
allow users to assess the level of evidence for a particular
recommendation and act accordingly.

I am grateful for all the comments that have been made in the
edition are welcome. Please post or email comments to me at
Editorial Panel members for their work on this edition. I also thank the
publishing team of Nicola, Ben and Marion at BSAVA for their editorial
and administrative assistance. Lastly,I would like to acknowledge the
huge debt of thanks that I, and all other BSAVA members, owe to my
predecessor Dr Bryn Tennant for his unstinting efforts over the first
five editions of this book. I hope the sixth edition maintains the high
standards that he set and we can build on his achievements in the
coming editions.

Foreword
The BSAVA Smalf Animal Formularyhas become established as one
of the most useful books on the practice shelf. It contains a wealth of
vital information on available drugs and how to use them to best
effect - but remains a manageable size and exceptionally user-
friendly. As such, it is one of the most valued of the benefits of BSAVA
membership; each BSAvA member is sent a free copy of each new
edition as it is published.
The first edition of the formulary was published in 1994, and
subsequent editions have been published at 3-yearly intervals since
then. lan Ramsey has taken over the role of Editor-in-Chief for this
work and expertise over the years has allowed each edition of the
andundoubtedknowledge.
The appropriate and responsible use of medicines is a vital issue for
the profession, both in the context of ensuring the best possible
treatment for each individual patient, and in the wider context of
human and animal health. The BSAVA Smafl Anima! Formulary
contributes in no small part by ensuring that veterinary surgeons

safeguards and may, therefore, pose potential risks that the
authorizationprocess seeks to minimize.
Medicines may be used 'off-label for a variety of reasons including:

Health and safety in dispensing
All drugs are potentially poisonous to humans as well as animals.
Toxicity may be mild or severe and includes carcinogenic and
teratogenic effects. warnings are given in the monographs. However,
risks to humans dispensing medicines are not always well
characterized and idiosyncratic reactions may occur. It is good
practice for everyone to wear protective clothing (including
gloves) when directly handling medicines, not to eat or drink (or
store food or drink) near medicines, and to wash their hands
frequently when working with medicines. Gloves, masks and
safety glasses should be worn if handling potentially toxic liquids,
cytotoxic drugs and use laminar flow cabinets for the preparation and
dispensing of these medications.
Many prescribers and users ofmedicines are not aware of the
of medicines included in the BSAVA Formulary that are known or
potential carcinogens or teratogens. The lists are not all-inclusive:
they include only those substances that have been evaluated. Most of
the drugs are connected only with certain kinds of cancer. The

Adverse reactions: Dose-related reversible bone marrow
suppression can develop in all species. Unlike humans, the
K
does not appear to be a significant problem. The cat, which has a
reduced capacity to metabolize chloramphenicol, is more susceptible
to bone marrow suppression and this is associated with both dose
size and duration of therapy. Other adverse effects include nausea,

Action: Inhibits actions of acetylcholine at neuromuscular junction by
A
junctionalmembrane.
B
Use: Provision of neuromuscular blockade during anaesthesia. This
may be to improve surgical access through muscle relaxation, to
c
Cisatracurium is one of the isomers that comprise atracurium; it is
D
3-5 times more potent than atracurium in dogs. This means that the
plasma concentrations of the epileptogenic byproduct laudanosine
E
are lower and there is less histamine release. Monitoring (using a
nerve stimulator) and reversal of the neuromuscular blockade is
anaesthesia.Hypothermia,acidosis and hypokalaemia will prolong
G
the duration of action of neuromuscular blockade.
Safety and handling: Store in refrigerator.
H
Contraindications: Do not administer unless the animal is
ventilationareavailable.
Adverse reactions: Can precipitate the release of histamine after
rapid i.v. administration, resulting in bronchospasm and hypotension.
K
Diluting the drug in normal saline and giving the drug slowly i.v.
minimizes these effects.

Fentanyl/Fluanisone (Hypnorm) PoM-V CD ScHeouLE 2
G
Formulations: Injectable: 0.2 mg/ml fentanyl with 10 mg/ml
fluanisone.
H
Action: Fentanyl is a pure OP3 opioid agonist and fluanisone is a
butyrophenone, the combination produces neuroleptanalgesia.
Use: Sedation and analgesia for restraint and to allow minor
procedures to be carried out in mice, rats, rabbits and guinea pigs.
V
Combined with a benzodiazepine it can be used to produce
K
anaesthesia with muscle relaxation for surgery. It can be used for
premedication prior to induction of anaesthesia with propofol in
L
rabbits. Fentanyl/fluanisone produces a long duration of sedation and
analgesia in small mammals (30-60 min), the duration of action is
M
dependent on dose and varies between species. When used in
combination with a benzodiazepine to produce anaesthesia, the dose
N

H
Use: In humans it is indicated in the management of neutropenia,
especially in patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy. Neutrophil
counts rise within 24 hours. Following discontinuation of therapy.
neutrophil counts drop to normal after 5 days. There are few reports
on the use of G-CsF in dogs or cats. It is most likely to be used in the

Gabapentin (Gabapentinum) (Neurontin*) PoM
Formulations: Oral: 100 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg capsules.
Action: The precise mechanism of action of gabapentin is unknown;
however,it has been suggested that it increases the synaptic levels
of GABA in the CNS, most likely through increased synthesis of
GABA. Gabapentin has been demonstrated to decrease the influx of
M
calcium ions into neurons via a specific subunit of voltage-dependent
calcium channels. Gabapentin does not interact with sodium-
N
dependent channels and demonstrates no affinity for the common
neurotransmitter receptors, including benzodiazepine, glutamate,
0
glycineanddopamine.
Use: Adjunctive therapy in the treatment of seizures refractory to
P
treatment with phenobarbital and/or potassium bromide. Gabapentin
has also been used in the treatment of neuropathic pain in adult
Q
neuropathic pain in human patients, which is often insensitive to
R
opioid analgesics. Gabapentin crosses the blood-brain barrier more
readily than GABA, which is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in
s
the CNS. After multiple dosing, peak plasma concentrations of
gabapentin are usually achieved within 2 hours of a dose and steady
withdrawn slowly. Monitoring of serum levels in dogs and in human
U
patients does not appear useful. In one study of dogs on doses of
approximately 10 mg/kg q8h, serum levels of gabapentin after 3
months of therapy ranged from 2.2 to 20.7 mg/l.
W
Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed.
Contraindications: Gabapentin should be used with caution in
X
patients with renal impairment and behavioural abnormalities
Adverse reactions: The most commonly reported adverse effect
in dogs is mild sedation and ataxia. False-positive readings have
been reported with some urinary protein tests in human patients
taking gabapentin.

Imidapril (Prilium) PoM
Formulations: Oral: 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg powders for

Q
Action: Imidapril is a pro-drug, which is hydrolysed to form an active
metabolite imidoprilat. Imidoprilat inhibits angiotensin-converting
R
enzymes, thereby inhibiting conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin
Il. Angiotensin Il, a potent vasopressor, stimulates release of
aldosterone and vasopressin, facilitates the central and peripheral
T
glomerular filtration rate. Inhibiting angiotensin Il production results in
U
afterload, and lowered blood pressure. Imidapril reduces salt and
water retention.

Safety and handling: Measures should be adopted to prevent

Contraindications: Avoid gaseous induction in chelonians as they

Adverse reactions: Isoflurane causes dose-dependent hypotension

by causing vasodilation, particularly in skeletal muscle. This adverse
effect does not wane with time. lsoflurane is a more potent respiratory

depressant than halothane, respiratory depression is dose-

arrhythmias in certain conditions. Assertions that isoflurane is safer
than halothane in certain high-risk cases should be discounted.

Isoflurane is not metabolized by the liver (0.2%) and has less effect
on liver blood flow compared with halothane.

Formulations: Oral: 250 mg, 500 mg and 750 mg tablets;
100 mg/ml solution.
Action: The mechanism of anticonvulsant action is unknown.
K
Use: Treatment of epilepsy in humans. In veterinary patients
efficacy has been shown mainly as adjunctive therapy in the
L
treatment of seizures refractory to treatment with phenobarbital
and/or potassium bromide. Levetiracetam is an analogue of
M
piracetam with a structure differentto all other current
anticonvulsants. Levetiracetum does not demonstrate afinity for
N
receptors or electrolyte channels or messengers systems to which
other antiepileptic drugs bind. Levetiracetam is rapidly absorbed
0
from the Gl tract with peak plasma concentrations reached in
<2 hours of oral dosing. Steady state is rapidly acheived within
P
2 days. Plasma protein binding is minimal. The plasma half-life is
short, being around 7 hours in human patients. Information on this

Formulations: Injectable: 10 mg/ml solution. Oral: 16 mg, 24 mg,
60 mg,160 mg tablets.
s
Action: Inhibits vomiting reflex by blocking NK-1 receptors in
medullary vomiting centre. A high degree of protein binding gives a
long duration of activity (24 hours). Maropitant is not known to have
U
anyprokinetic effect.
Use: Treatment and prevention of vomiting in dogs, including that
caused by chemotherapy and motion sickness. There have been no
studies in feline clinical patients. However, the manufacturer has
W
conducted a number of studies on cats from which it can be
concluded that maropitant is well tolerated and has potent antiemetic

Drug interactions: Digoxin levels may be increased by quinidine.
It is recommended that the dose of digoxin be decreased by half
H
and digoxin be assessed. The effect of neuromuscular blockers
(e.g. atracurium, suxamethonium, tubocurarine) may be enhanced
by quinidine. Drugs that alkalinize urine (e.g. antacids, carbonic
J
anhydrase inhibitors, sodium bicarbonate, thiazide diuretics)
reduce the excretion of quinidine, thus prolonging its half-life.
K
The half-life of quinidine may be reduced by as much as 50% as a
consequence of hepatic enzyme induction by phenobarbital or
L
phenytoin. Cimetidine inhibits the metabolism of quinidine by
inhibiting hepatic microsomal enzymes, thereby increasing its effect.
M
Additive cardiac depressant effects and an increased risk of
ventricular arrhythmias may result if quinidine is used with anti-

arrhythmic drugs (e.g. procainamide). There is an increased risk of
hypotension if quinidine is used with verapamil.

P
Use: Induction and maintenance of anaesthesia. Sevoflurane is
potent and highly volatile so should only be delivered from a suitable
Q
calibrated vaporizer. It is less soluble in blood than halothane and
R
quicker. Sevoflurane has a less pungent smell than isoflurane and
induction of anaesthesia using chambers or masks is usually well
s
tolerated in small dogs and cats. The concentration of sevoflurane
required to maintain anaesthesia depends on the other drugs used in
adjusted according to clinical assessment of anaesthetic depth. The
U
cessation of administration results in rapid recovery, which may
occasionally be associated with signs of agitation. Sevoflurane does
not sensitize the myocardium to catecholamines to the extent that
halothane does.
M
Safety and handling: Measures should be adopted to prevent
contamination of the environment.

Contraindications: Sevoflurane is degraded by soda lime to

taken to mean the decision made by the prescriber as to which
product should be supplied, taking account of the circumstances of
the animals being treated, the available authorized veterinary
medicinal products and the need for responsible use of medicines.
Good prescription principles include the following. Only 1, 8, 10 and
12 are legal requirements; the remainder are good practice.
1.
Print or write legibly in ink or otherwise so as to be indelible.
Sign in ink with your normal signature. Include the date on which
the prescription was signed.
2.
letters - do not abbreviate. Ensure the full name is stated, to
include the pharmaceutical form and strength
3.
State duration of treatment where known and the total quantity to
be supplied.
4.
Write out microgram/nanogram - do not abbreviate.
5.
Always put a 0 before an initial decimal point (e.g. 0.5 mg),
but avoid the unnecessary use of a decimal point (e.g. 3 mg
not 3.0 mg).
6.
Give precise instructions concerning route/dose/formulation.
Directions should preferably be in English without abbreviation.
It isrecognized thatsomeLatinabbreviations areused(p.358)
7.
Any alterations invalidate the prescription - rewrite.
8.
Prescriptions for Schedule 2 and most Schedule 3 Controlled
Drugs must be entirely handwritten and include the total quantity
in both words and figures, the form and strength of the drug.
9.
without re-checking the patient.
10. Include both the prescriber's and the client's names and
addresses.
11. The directions that the prescriber wishes to appear on the
labelled product. It is good practice to include the words 'For
animal treatment only'
12. A declaration that 'This prescription is for an animal under my
care' or words to that effect.

Dosing small and exotic animals
Past editions of the Formulary have contained tables of doses or
applications of drugs for various 'exotic' animals. However, for this
edition all doses are included in the relevant monographs together
with comments on their use in various species. This has been done
because of the increasing range of species that are included in the
Formulary. Veterinary surgeons who are unfamiliar with the actions of
more complete references (see Further reading).
The size of some animals, particularly 'exotic pets', makes dosing
difficult and care must be taken when calculating small doses. Some
points to bear in mind when dosing are:
Where powders are to be dissolved in water, sterile water for
injection should be used.
Most solutions may be diluted with water for injection or 0.9%
saline.
Dilution will be necessary when volumes <0.1 ml are to be
administered.
Suspensions cannot be diluted.
Use 1 ml syringes for greatest accuracy.
When reformulating tablets, consider using a pharmacist.

Antibacterial selection
Antibiotic selection according to organ system
Bone: Most antibacterials penetrate bone, as it has a good blood
supply, and are then distributed in interstitial fluid. Osteomyelitis is
drug therapy should be made after culture of bone fragments
be chosen. These include:
Amoxicillin/Clavulanate
Clindamycin
Cefalexin
Lincomycin
Urinary tract:Many antibacterials attain highconcentrationsinurine
since this is a major route of excretion for drugs. lf a drug is filtered
but not reabsorbed to any extent, its urine concentration exceeds its
plasma concentration by 100-fold. Some drugs are actively secreted
into urine (e.g. beta-lactams) and reach concentrations that are 300
times higher than plasma concentrations. The susceptibility of urinary
pathogens is fairly predictable; if the animal has not been treated with
antibacterial drugs in the last couple of months, the following
antibacterial drugs are successful in more than 8o% of cases of
uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections according to the
causative organism involved.

Potentiated sulphonamide
Staphylococcus spp.
Ampicillin or amoxicillin

Recurrent or relapsing urinary tract infections should have cultures
penicillins should be reserved for the more difficult infections.
Aminoglycosides may be required in some cases, but their
nephrotoxic effects should always be considered in cases where
renal involvement may be present.
Prostate: Many antimicrobials attain therapeutic concentrations in the
that are weak bases have the added advantage that they will be ion
trapped in the acidic prostatic fluid. Examples include:

Clindamycin
Fluoroquinolones
Doxycycline
Trimethoprim
Consider also the spectrum of activity. For example, potentiated
sulphonamides have a reasonably broad spectrum of activity whilst
Fluoroquinolones are also 'broad spectrum' with superior activity
against Gram-negative organisms.
Hepatic/biliary system: Antibacterials that penetrate liver and biliary
tract well include:
Aminoglycosides
Cefalexin
Amoxicillin
Clindamycin
Amoxicillin/clavulanate
Fluoroquinolones
Ampicillin
Metronidazole
It should be noted that some of these agents should be avoided in

greater risk when compared with other species due to the
suppression of normal bacterial flora, resulting in overgrowth of other
species, notably Clostridium, resulting in enterotoxaemia and death.
Mice, rats, ferrets and usually gerbils are fairly resistant, whereas
The risk of enterotoxaemia is related to several factors including the

nutritional status and general health. In general: penicillins,
aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, metronidazole and
sulphonamides are the least risky. Tetracyclines are risky in the
guinea pig but appear less so in other species (Prescott et al., 2000).

Action
Barium sulphate has a higher atomic number than body tissues and
therefore appears radiopaque. Barium sulphate is inert with no
secretions.
Appendix365
Use
Used for gastrointestinal (Gl) and oesophageal contrast studies.
Enables visualization of lumen of oesophagus and Gl tract. Barium
impregnated polyethylene spheres(BiPS) may be used to assess
intestinal transit times, gastric emptying rate and to detect
obstructions. As with all contrast studies, plain radiographs should be
taken prior to administration of barium. Barium paste is used for
strictures or dilatations not seen with liquid barium or paste. Barium/
may be used to evaluate any part of the Gl tract and is used alone
for evaluation of the stomach and intestines. Refer to radiographic
preparations designed for human use may be unpalatable for some
animals. Mixing of barium with methycellulose may improve the
quality of Gl tract studies.
Safety and handling
Skin irritation may occur with skin contact.
Contraindications and adverse reactions
Barium is insoluble and should not be used outside the Gl tract. If
use a water-soluble contrast medium, as barium will prevent
evaluation of the mucosa.Leakage of barium intobody cavitiesmay
lead to granulomatous reactions or adhesions. If oesophageal or Gl
tract perforation is suspected,low-osmolar water-soluble contrast
media should be used.Aspiration of barium during administration or
as a result of vomiting or regurgitation can lead to aspiration
pneumonia. May cause constipation, transient diarrhoea and
abdominal pain.

Use
Contrast studies of the Gl tract and urinary tract, angiography,
and myelography. Only non-ionic agents may be used for
myelography in humans.
Contraindications
Known or suspected sensitivity to iodine-containing preparations.
Uncontrolled hyperthyroidism is a contraindication in humans. Should
be used with care in animals with moderate to severe impairment of
renal function. Primarily excreted via kidneys and pre-existing renal
disease predisposes to contrast media-induced renal failure. Fluid
and electrolyte disturbances should be corrected prior to use.
Adversereactions
Anaphylaxis may occur following i.v. injection of any iodinated
contrast medium. Nausea, vomiting, hypotension, dyspnoea,
disturbances have been reported in humans following i.v. injection.
Seizures or transient motor or sensory dysfunction have been
reported in humans following myelography. Aspiration of high osmolar
clinical signs in patients with myasthenia gravis. These effects are
more common with ionic than with non-ionic media and with hyper-
neonatesandanimalswithcardiovasculardisease.Whenused
intravascularly, catheters should be flushed regularly to minimize risk
than ionic preparations. Extravasation of high-osmolar agents may
rarely lead to soft tissue injury. Warming the contrast media prior to
injection reduces minor side effects. Specific formulations for Gl
presence of additives.
Drug interactions
lodinated contrast media decrease thyroid uptake of iodine and
patients on beta blockers.
Doses and advice on use
Consult standard radiographic texts for doses and details of how to
perform procedures.
MRI contrast media
Several gadolinium chelates are used in magnetic resonance imaging
are POM.
368Appendix
Action
Gadolinium exerts its paramagnetic effects due to 7 unpaired
electrons, which cause a shortening of T1 and T2 relaxation times of
adjacent tissues. This results in an increased signal on T1-weighted
MR images. Gadolinium is toxic so is chelated to reduce toxicity.
Gadolinium chelates do not cross the normal blood-brain barrier due
to their large molecular size.
Use
During MRl to identify areas of abnormal vascularization or increased
interstitial fluid, delineate masses, demonstrate disruption of the
gadofosveset are also used for contrast-enhanced magnetic
the characterization of liver lesions.
Safety and handling
Contact with skin and eyes may cause mild irritation.
Contraindications
Use with caution in cardiac disease, pre-existing renal disease and
neonates. Contraindicated in severe renal impairment.
Adverse reactions
Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (most commonly with gadodiamide)
reported inhumans but not in animals.Increase in QTinterval and
hyper-osmolar and irritant if extravasation, therefore should be given
through intravenous catheter.May cause transient increase in serum
bilirubin if pre-existing hepatic disease. In experimental studies may
cause fetal abnormalities in rabbits.
Drug interactions
May have interactions with Class 1a and 3 antiarrhythmics. Gadobenic
acid may compete for cannalicular multispecific organic anionic
transporter sites. Caution should be used if administering cisplatin,
anthracyclines, vinca alkyloids and other drugs using this transporter.
Anionic drugs excreted in bile (e.g. rifampicin) may reduce hepatic
some laboratory results, e.g. serum iron determination using
enzymes, false reduction in calcium.
Doses and further advice on use
ShouldbeusedroutinelyforMRlexaminationsof thebrain.Usefor
Post-contrast images should ideally be obtained within 30 minutes of
contrast administration. Total doses should not exceed 0.3 mmol/kg

Birds:Injectable anaesthesia is best avoided unless in field situations
(e.g. swans/ratites), diving (e.g. ducks) or high altitude birds. Even in
these species, gaseous induction and maintenance (e.g. with
isoflurane/sevoflurane) would still be the normal recommendation
wherever possible. Premedicants are rarely used as extra handling
will add to the general stress of the situation. On occasions,
diazepam may be used at 0.2-0.5 mg/kg i.m. (or midazolam 0.1-0.5
mg/kg i.m.); either drug may be used at 0.05-0.15 mg/kg i.v.

1.0-1.5 mg/kg are given slowly i.v. to effect. May also be given i.m.
but this produces different effects in different species and specific
literature or specialist advise should be consulted.
Ketamine/medetomidine combinations can be used for raptors:
