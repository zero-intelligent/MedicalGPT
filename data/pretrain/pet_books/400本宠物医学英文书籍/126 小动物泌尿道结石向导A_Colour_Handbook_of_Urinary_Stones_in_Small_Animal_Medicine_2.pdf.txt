Drugs can appear as urinary stones if there is
insufficient dilution of urine during prolonged,
high-dosc medication, or if therc is backflow of
urine into the kidneys or bladder. The drugs
that are most commonly implicated as raw
materials in the formation of urinary stones are
the sulphonamides and sulfadiazine.45.64 Only
a small proportion of stones are found to be
drug-induced on analysis. One European study
found four sulphonamide stones (0.1%).8 For
anatomical reasons, males are found to have
these stones more often than females,and
affected dogs tend to be older.

·Support diuresis:clean water adlibitum

offer moistened dry food or a special

Provide optimal conditions to encourage
regular urination, clean cat litter (1+rule).

Avoid excess bodyweight.
Avoid stressfactors.
Do not administer furosemide.

The ColourHandbook dealswith all
aspects of urolithiasis in dogs, cats,
rabbits and guinea pigs - from aetiology
and pathogenesis to diagnosis,
treatment and theprevention of disease
recurrence.
The authors introduce the reader to
treatmentprotocols developed from
their own research and experience,and
incorporateinternationalstate-of-the-
art knowledge of the disease. Topics
covered in the Colour Handbook
include:
·Epidemiology
·Risks in companion animal
husbandry
Species-specific differences
·Breed dispositions
·Genetic causes
·Relevant anatomical points
· Clinical diagnosis
·Stone composition
·Clinical pathology
·Treatmentprotocols
The Colour Handbook is a compact,
wide-ranging illustrated guide to
dealing with urinary stones in small
animals, of value to veterinarians in
training and practice.
