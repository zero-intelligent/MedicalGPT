DISCLAIMER
Doses listed are species specific, unless otherwise listed. There is no assurance for safety
and efficacy in other animal species not listed. Many of the doses listed are extralabel
Or are human drugs used in an off-label or extralabel manner. Federal regulations allow
use of extralabel veterinary drugs and human drugs in non-food-producing animals
when there is a valid veterinarian-client-patient relationship. However, there are restric-
tions for using these drugs in food-producing animals under the Animal Medicinal
Drug Use Clarification Act (AMDUCA) of 1994. These drugs are prohibited from
use in food-producing animals unless certain requirements are met, which include
extended withdrawal times for meat and milk. These requirements can be found at
www.avma.org/reference/amduca/amducal.asp.
Doses listed are based on best available evidence at the time of the drug handbook
preparation; however, the author cannot ensure efficacy of drugs used according to
recommendations in this book. Other patient factors, or actions of the drug not known
at the time of the book preparation, may affect efficacy. Adverse effects of which the
drugs listed in this handbook.
Veterinarians using this handbook are encouraged to check current literature,

Preface
The third edition of this handbook was developed using a similar style, layout, and
format as the second edition. Additions, changes in individual drug monographs, and
and students and because new information has become available. New drugs that have
been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), or for which there
is new information about its use in the literature, have been added. The drugs listed
represent the most important medications used in companion animals and livestock.
Practically every drug monograph has been updated, and more than 35 new drugs
have been added. In this edition, as in the one that preceded it, I included the most
recently approved drugs for animals in addition to human medications for which vet-
eninary uses have been identified. Information has been updated on clinical uses and
regulatory requirements. The information on drug stability, storage, and compounding
information on the dnug's effcacy and clinical use in the “Indications and Clinical
information for each medication, the sections are divided into categonies for drug
interactions, precautions, pharmacology, and clinical use. Tables for quick reference
can be found in the Appendix. These appendix tables include antibiotics of choice,
dnug interactions, regulatory information, phone numbers and Internet sites for drug
information, and a section on dnug dose calculations.
The book is designed for busy practitioners and students who need to use their
time efficiently and locate accurate and reliable drug information quickly. The format
is consistent from drug to drug, and veterinarians and their staff will quickly become
familiar with the layout of each drug monograph in order to rapidly locate concise and
accurate information about each drug.
In preparing this handbook, my priorities were accuracy and reliability. As in each
of the first two editions, the indications for use and drug dosing information were
prepared from a review of the literature or derived frorm reviews presented by clinical
experts. In some cases, dosages originated from clinical studies; in other cases, they
represent a consensus of clinical experience. Manufacturers’ recommendations are
considered in the dosing recommendations, but other suggestions (of-label indications
and uses) also may be listed where the use and dosage have gone beyond those listed
on the product's label. Where dosage recommendations have varied among sources, I
have applied my clinical judgment and more than 25 years of experience in veterinary
clinical pharmacology to derive a scientifically valid dose. In some cases, it may have
been necessary to derive a dose based on extrapolations from human medicine, but
this was limited to drugs for which the therapeutic index of the drug is high. To derive
withdrawal times for food animals, the highest priority has been given to the withdrawal
 r e-  n s a  h a   
suggestions made by the Food Animal Residue Avoidance Databank (FARAD;
www.farad.org) were used. If neither of these was available, I listed a conservative
pe snaud snp sun uo pseq an ieaiim pisns e iog as
likelihood that it may cause harmful residues.
Each drug is listed primarily by its official name (USAN) that is recognized by the
United States Pharmacopeia (USP; www.usp.org). Following each drug name is the
brand or trade name and synonyms by which the drug also may be known. Not all of
viPreface
their official name. Tables are presented in the front section of the book that cross-
reference cach drug's USAN to other names by which the drug is known. The cross-
reference table lists dnugs according to their functional classification and drug use. It
may not include all of the known uses for a drug but represents the most common
clinical use.
As clinical experience increases and our knowledge of the pharmacology of these
drugs expands, new information may become available for the medications listed in
this book. I welcome feedback relating to adverse effects observed, clinical experience,
and omissions or errors identifed. For these and other input and suggestions,
I can be reached at mark_papich@ncsu.edu. Adverse drug events also should be
reported to the drug sponsor directly or the FDA using this website: www.fda.gov/
AnimalVeterinary/SafetyHealth/ReportaProblem/.

Acepromazine Maleate
A
ayss-proe'meh-zeen mal'ee-ate
Trade and other names: ACE, Aceproject, Aceprotabs, Atravet, and Promace;
it sometimes is called acetylpromazine.
Functional classification: Tranquilizer, phenothiazine tranquilizer
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Phenothiazine tranquilizer and sedative. Acepromazine inhibits central dopaminergic
antimuscarinic action and blocks norepinephrine at adrenergic receptors (e.g.,
alpha-receptors). Because of the blockade of alpha-receptors on vascular smooth
muscle it also produces vasodilation.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Acepromazine is used as a sedative, a tranquilizer, a preanesthetic, and an anesthetic
adjunct. In small animals, acepromazine can produce antiemetic effects. For some
indications, the administration also produces vasodilation. In horses for treatment of
laminitis, it has increased the arterial digital blood flow after a dose of 0.02-0.04 mg/kg.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Sedation and ataxia are common side effects. Extrapyramidal effects (involuntary
muscle movements), twitching, dystonia, or Parkinson-like effects are rare but are
possible with the administration of phenothiazines to animals. Phenothiazines may
produce excessive vagal tone in some animals. This may be especially prominent in
trachycephalic breeds. Administration of atropine may be used to treat the signs of
high vagal tone. Because of alpha-adrenergic antagonism, hypotension is possible in
effect in horses is unpredictable and apparently not related to dose.
Contraindications and Precautions
Use cautiously in animals that are prone to seizures. However, a risk of seizures
in animals from administration of acepromazine may not be as much of a risk as
once thought. Seizures were not reported to be a clinical problem in
retrospective studies of patients who had seizures.
Do not use in animals that have problems with dystonia or that have had
extrapyramidal effects from use of phenothiazines.
use cautiously with other hypotensive drugs or in conditions that may exacerbate
hypotension.
 In pregnancy it produced only minor reduction in blood flow and oxygen
delivery to the fetus when used in late pregnancy in cows.
Drug Interactions
Acepromazine may potentiate other drugs that cause vasodilation. Acepromazine
may increase the risk of seizures if administered with other drugs that lower
seizure threshold, but this may not be as much of a risk as once thought.
Acepromazine has been used to sedate dogs for glucose tolerance testing
(0.1 mg/kg), without adversely affecting the results.
2  Acetaminophen
Instructions for Use
Acepromazine can be administered PO, IV, or IM. When used with general
anesthetics, lower doses of general anesthetics can be used, especially when
se  si  s   s 
administration are most prominent during the first 3-4 hours after administration
but may persist for 7 hours.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor blood pressure in animals susceptible to hypotension. Acepromazine does
not affect adrenal function testing in dogs.
Formulations
Acepromazine is available in 5-, 10-, and 25-mg tablets and in a 10 mg/mL
injection. Acepromazine oral granules and powder are available in Canada.
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature.
Stability of compounded formulations has not been investigated.
Small Animal Dosage
Dogs
· 0.025-0.1 mg/kg IM, IV, or SQ in a single dose (most common is 0.025 mg/
kg). Do not exceed 3 mg total in dogs.
· Sedation: 0.5-2.2 mg/kg q6-8h PO.
Cats
·0.025-0.1 mg/kg IM, IV, or SQ in a single dose.
· Sedation: 1.1-2.2 mg/kg q6-8h PO.
Large Animal Dosage
Horses
· 0.04-0.1 mg/kg IM, q 6-12h, but frequent dosing is not recommended and an
interval of 36-48 hours between doses is recommended. For perioperative use,
0.01-0.05 mg/kg, IM, SQ, or IV.
Cattle
· 0.13-0.26 mg/kg PO, 0.03-0.1 mg/kg IM, or 0.01-0.02 mg/kg IV.
Pigs
·Adult: 0.03-0.2 mg/kg IV, IM, SQ (single dose).
Regulatory Information
Withdrawal times: There are no withdrawal times established in the US. It has been
estimated that for extralabel use, establish a withdrawal time of at least 7 days for
meat and 48 hours for milk.
Canada: 7 days for meat; 48 hours for milk.
RCI Classification: 3
Acetaminophen
ah-seet-ah-mee'noe-fen
Trade and other names: Tylenol and generic brands
Functional classification: Analgesic
Acetaminophen 3
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Analgesic drug. Exact mechanism of action is not known; however, acetaminophen
凸
analgesia may occur via inhibition of COX-3, a variant of COX-1 found in the
central nervous system. Other evidence indicates that acetaminophen may inhibit
prostaglandins in some cells and tissue in which low concentrations of arachidonic
acid are present. The site of acetaminophen action may be the peroxidase enzyme
component of prostaglandin H2 synthase. Therefore, COX inhibition may occur
at site-specific tissues, sparing the gastrointestinal mucosa, platelets, and kidneys
but acting centrally. Other evidence suggests that acetaminophen can stimulate
that acetaminophen may directly activate serotonin receptors.
 In canine studies it has not produced anti-inflammatory action but has been
effective as an analgesic agent.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Acetaminophen is used as an analgesic and for pain control in dogs. Do not use in
cats. It is considered relatively weak as an analgesic. Often used in combination with
an opiate (e.g, codeine).
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Acetaminophen is well tolerated in dogs at doses listed; however, high doses have
caused liver toxicity. It causes severe toxicosis in cats because of their inability to
excrete metabolites. Clinical signs of toxicity include methemoglobinemia, acute
hepatic toxicosis, swelling of paws, and Heinz body anemia.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not administer to cats. In people, toxic episodes are more likely when
administered with drugs that alter the activity of hepatic drug enzymes. Such a
reaction also is possi ble in animals.
In cats, treatment of intoxication requires prompt treatment with
acetylcysteine (see monograph for acetylcysteine) and monitoring.
Drug Interactions
 In people, other drugs (especially alcohol) will increase risk of hepatotoxicosis.
It is not known if other drugs increase this risk in animals.
Instructions for Use
Many non-prescription (OTC) formulations are available. Acetaminophen with
codeine may have greater analgesic efficacy in some animals. See other entries for
formulations that contain codeine.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor liver enzyme levels periodically to look for evidence of hepatotoxicity.
In cats that have received acetaminophen, there is a high risk of toxicity and
careful monitoring of liver enzymes and blood cell parameters is needed. Many
human hospitals and some diagnostic laboratonies can measure acetaminophen
concentrations in plasma. In people, treatment is initiated if plasma/serum
concentrations are above 200 mcg/mL 4 hours after ingestion.
4  Acetaminophen + Codeine
Formulations
Acetaminophen is available in 120-, 160-, 325-, and 500-mg tablets.
Stability and Storage
Acetaminophen is stable in aqueous solutions. Maximum stability is at pH of
5-7.
Small Animal Dosage
Dogs
·15 mg/kg q8h PO.
Cats
·Contraindicated.
Large Animal Dosage
Calves
50 mg/kg PO, followed by 30 mg/kg PO q6h.
No other doses have been reported for large animals.
Regulatory Information
No regulatory information is available. For extralabel use withdrawal interval
cstimates, contact FARAD at l-888-USFARAD (1-888-873-2723).
RCI Classification: 4
Acetaminophen + Codeine
ah-seet-ah-mee'noe-fen + koe'deen
Trade and other names: Tylenol with codeine and many generic brands
Functional classification: Analgesic, opioid
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Analgesic agent. Exact mechanism of action for acetaminophen is not known;
however, as discussed previously, a centrally mediated mechanism is likely, either via
inhibition of central prostaglandin synthesis or effects on serotonergic inhibitory
Effects of codeine are not established in animals. Systemic absorption of codeine
from oral administration is small in dogs, and codeine may play only a minor role in
analgesia.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Acetaminophen + Codeine is used for analgesia in dogs (e.g., postoperative use).
Codeine or codeine with acetaminophen is indicated for treatment of moderate
pain.
Codeine fommulations have also been used as an antitussive. Despite the
widespread use of codeine in humans, the efficacy in animals for its antitussive use
or analgesic use has not been established.
Oral absorption of codeine in dogs is low. Because codeine is converted to
morphine (l0% of dose) for its activity and the duration of morphine is short in
dogs, the clinical effectiveness of codeine in dogs may be questionable.

Acetazolamide
ah-seet-ah-zole'a-mide
Trade and other names: Diamox
Functional classification: Diuretic
6 Acetazolamide
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Acetazolamide, like other carbonic anhydrase
inhibitors, produces a diuresis through inhibition of the uptake of bicarbonate
in proximal renal tubules via enzyme inhibition. This action results in loss of
bicarbonate in the urine and a diuresis. The action of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors
results in urine loss of bicarbonate, alkaline unine, and water loss.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Acetazolamide is rarely used as a diuretic any longer. There are more potent and
effective diuretic drugs available such as the loop diuretics (furosemide).
Acetazolamide, like other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, is used primarily to
lower intraocular pressure in animals with glaucoma. Methazolamide is used more
often than acetazolamide for this purpose, and other treatment regimens are now
used more often than carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.
Acetazolamide, like other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, is sometimes used to
produce more alkaline urine for management of some urinary calculi.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Acetazolamide can potentially produce hypokalemia in some patients. Significant
bicarbonate loss can occur with repeated administration. In dogs, a respiratory
reaction has been observed, which is attributed to respiratory acidosis.
Contraindications and Precautions
 Do not use in patients with acidemia. Use cautiously in any animal sensitive to
sulfonamides.
Drug Interactions
Acetazolamide will produce alkaline urine, which may affect clearance of some
drugs. Alkaline urine may potentiate the effects of some antibacterial drugs (e.g.,
macrolides and quinolones).
Instructions for Use
Acetazolamide, in combination with other agents, is usually used to decrease
intraocular pressure in the treatment of glaucoma. Acetazolamide has been used to
produce alkaline urine to prevent formation of some urinary calculi. However, unless
there is supplementation with bicarbonate, the urine alkalinization will not be
sustained with repeated administration.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor patient's ocular pressure when used to treat glaucoma.
Formulations
Acetazolamide is available in 125- and 250-mg tablets.
Stability and Storage
Stable if stored in tight containers. Compounded solutions are stable at least 60
days.

Acetylcysteine
ah-see-til-sis'tay-een
Trade and other names: Mucomyst and Acetadote. Also referred to as
N-acetylcysteine.
Functional classification: Mucolytic, antidote
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Acetylcysteine decreases viscosity of secretions and is used as a mucolytic agent in
eyes and in bronchial nebulizing solutions. Acetylcysteine is a sulfhydryl compound
and acts to increase synthesis of glutathione in the liver. Glutathione subsequently
acts as an antioxidant and facilitates conjugation to toxic metabolites, particularly the
toxic metabolites of acetaminophen. The antioxidant effects also have been used to
treat conditions associated with oxidative stress.
Indications and Clinical Uses
As a donator of the sulfhydryl group, it is used as an antidote for intoxications
(e.g., acetaminophen toxicosis in cats). When treating poisoning, it is important that
acetylcysteine be administered as soon as possible for optimum effectiveness.
Acetylcysteine also has been used to prevent contrast medium-induced nephropathy.
Acetylcysteine has been used as a treatment of oxidative stress because it is a
scavenger of hydroxyl radicals and hypochlorous acid. Acetylcysteine will reduce
cerebral edema.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
None reported in animals. Allergic reactions have been reported in people, which
resemble anaphylactic reactions when it is given IV. These reactions are manifest
as skin reactions, bronchospasm, tachycardia, and hypotension.
Contraindications and Precautions
Acetylcysteine may cause sensitization with prolonged topical administration. It
may react with certain matenials in nebulizing equipment.
Drug Interactions
Acetylcysteine acts to donate sulfhydryl groups and may facilitate drug conjugation.
Instructions for Use
Available as agent for decreasing viscosity of respiratory secretions, but most
common use is as a treatment for intoxications. In cats, acetylcysteine is used to

Acyclovir
a.y-sye'kloe-veer
Trade and other names: Zovirax and generic brands
Functional classification: Antiviral
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antiviral drug. Acyclovir is a synthetic purine analogue (acyclic nucleoside analogue).
It has antiviral activity against herpes virus. The action is related to the affnity for
the enzyme thymidine kinase (TK). However, resistance among some virus forms
is possible because of changes in TK or in the DNA polymerase. It is used for
treatment of various forms of herpes virus infection in humans and also has been
used for treatment of viral infections in animals. However, feline herpes virus l
(FHVl) is resistant to acyclovir and valciclovir, and studies are lacking on the
susceptibility of other herpes viruses. The half-life is 9.6 hours for horses, 2.3 hours
for dogs, and 2.6 hours for cats. By comparison, the half-life in humans is 2.5
hours. Unfortunately, it is not absorbed orally in horses (less than 3%), and there are

A
absorbed in people, but these have been expensive to use in animals. Information
on these drugs (penciclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir) can be found in other
monographs.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Acyclovir is an antiviral drug. The use in veterinary medicine is limited because the
activity against some viruses (e.g., FHVl) is either poor or unknown. In cats,
acyclovir had poor absorption and produced toxicity. Acyclovir is able to inhibit
replication of equine herpes virus (EHVl) in vitro. However, acyclovir oral
absorption in horses was poor and inconsistent and intravenous treatment is needed
for treatment of EHVl infection.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
The most serious adverse effect in humans is acute renal insufficiency. This may
be prevented by slow intravenous infusion and proper hydration. Phlebitis can
Dccur with intravenous administration. No adverse effects were identified in
imited studies performed in horses. In cats, significant adverse effects have
been observed, which included myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity, and
nephrotoxicity.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not use in animals with compromised renal function.
Drug Interactions
 Do not mix with biological solutions (e.g., blood products). Do not mix with
fluids that contain bacteriostatic preservatives. Do not use with other nephrotoxic
drugs.
Instructions for Use
To prepare injectable fomulation, dilute each vial with l0 or 20 mL of water to
parabens. Further dilute solution to at least 100 mL to a concentration of 7 mg/mL
or less.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor BUN and creatinine during use. In horses, doses should be administered to
maintain plasma concentrations above 0.3 mcg/mL.

Albuterol Sulfate
al-byoo'ter-ole sulfate
Trade and other names: Proventil, Ventolin, and Torpex equine inhaler. Also
known as Salbutamol outside the US.
Functional classification: Bronchodilator, beta-agonist
Albuterol Sulfate l13
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
A
Betaz-adrenergic agonist. Albuterol stimulates betaz-receptors to relax bronchial
smooth muscle. It may also inhibit release of inflammatory mediators, especially
from mast cells. This mechanism of action has been beneficial to relax bronchial
smooth muscle to relieve bronchospasm and bronchoconstriction.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Albuterol is indicated in a variety of airway diseases for bronchodilation. Except for
equine use, doses are primarily derived from extrapolation of human dose. Efficacy
studies for small animal use are not reported. Onset of action is l5-30 minutes, and
duration of action may be as long as 8 hours.
Albuterol is used as an inhaler (Torpex) in horses for treatment of airway
disease. It provides immediate relief of bronchospasm and bronchoconstriction in
horses.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Excessive beta-adrenergic stimulation at high doses results in tachycardia and
muscle tremors. Arhythmias are possible with high doses. All betaz-agonists
will inhibit uterine contractions at the end of gestation in pregnant animals.
High doses of beta2-agonists can lead to hypokalemia because they stimulate
Na*-K+-ATPase and increase intracellular K', while decreasing serum K+ and
producing hykperglycemia. Treatment consists of KCl supplement at a rate of
0.5 mEq/kg/hr.
Contraindications and Precautions
Avoid use in pregnant animals. IM or SQ injections can be painful.
Drug Interactions
 All beta-agonists will interact with, and potentiate other drugs that act on,
beta-adrenergic receptors.
Instructions for Use
Administration to horses requires an adaptor to facilitate a metered-dose inhaler.
For horses, each valve actuation (puff) of the device delivers l20 micrograms of
albuterol sulfate. One dose is three puffs, totaling 360 micrograms. For injection,
dilute solution to 0.0l mg/mL (10 mcg/mL) before injection and further dilute
to 50/50 with saline or 5% dextrose before injection. When used for
bronchoconstriction, it is helpful for acute exacerbations, used intermittently, with
other drugs (e.g., corticosteroids) administered for maintenance.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor heart rate and rhythm in animals with cardiovascular disease. Monitor
potassium concentrations for evidence of hypokalemia if high doses are administered.
Monitor glucose for evidence of hyperglycemia.
Formulations
Albuterol is available in 2-, 4-, and 5-mg tablets and 2-mg/5-mL syrup. Solutions

Alendronate
ah-len'droe-nate
Trade and other names: Fosamax
Functional classification: Antihypercalcemic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Bisphosphonate drug. Drugs in this class include pamidronate, risedronate,
zolendronate, and etidronate. This is a group of drugs charactenized by a germinal
bisphosphonate bond. They slow the formation and dissolution of hydroxyapatite
Crystals. Their clinical use is in their ability to inhibit bone resorption. These drugs
decrease bone tumover by inhibiting osteoclast activity, retarding bone resorption, and
decreasing the rate of osteoporosis. Alendronate is l00-1000 times more potent than
older drugs such as etidronate. Unfortunately, alendronate is poorly absorbed orally
(3%-7%), and use of oral formulations in animals may not be effective. In dogs, half-life
in plasma is short (l-2 hours), but there is prolonged update bone in which the
half-life is 300 days.
Indications and Clinical Uses
 Alendronate, like other bisphosphonate drugs, is used in people to treat osteoporosis
and treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy.
In animals, alendronate is used to decrease calcium in conditions that cause
hypercalcemia, such as cancer and vitamin D toxicosis. It may be helpfil for
managing neoplastic complications associated with pathologic bone resorption. It also
may provide pain relief in patients with pathologic bone disease. Most experimental
work performed in dogs has been performed with pamidronate rather than
alendronate.

Alfaxalone
Al-FAX-ah-lone
Trade and other names: Alfaxan (previous name was alphaxalone)
Functional classification: Anesthetic agent
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Alfaxalone is chemically alfaxalone-2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPCD). It is a
synthetic neuroactive steroid that interacts with GABA receptors in the central nervous
system to produce anesthesia and muscle relaxation. Alfaxalone is related to an older
16 Afaxalone
formulation (Saffan) first introduced in 197l, which was alfaxalone plus alfadolone
in a combination of neurosteroids. This older formulation was in a castor oil
fomulation that induced mast cell degranulation and histamine release and
produced swollen extremities, anaphylactic reactions, and other signs of histamine
release. This new formulation (Alfaxan) overcomes the formulation issue by usine a
cyclodextrin solubilizing vehicle. The half-life is short in animals (less than l hour)
doses.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Alfaxalone is used as a general anesthetic agent. It can be injected directly into the
cephalic vein or delivered via constant rate infusion. If injected directly, administer
been used safely with other anesthetic agents (e.g., propofol), and in combination
with premedications (e.g., opiates, atropine, phenothiazines, benzodiazepines, and

Allopurinol
al-oh-pyoo'rih-nole
Trade and other names: Lopurin, Zyloprim, and Allopur (Europe)
Functional Classification: Anti-inflammatory
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Purine analogue. Allopurinol decreases the production of uric acid by inhibiting
enzymes responsible for uric acid synthesis. The other use of allopurinol is treating
leishmaniasis. In parasites, allopurinol is metabolized to products that disrupt RNA
synthesis and interfere with protein synthesis. Allopurinol does not eliminate
Leishmanin or cure the disease, but it may improve cutaneous lesions and induce
remission.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Allopurinol is indicated to decrease formation of uric acid uroliths in at-risk animals.
Allopurinol also is used to treat clinical signs associated with leishmaniasis. When
used for leishmaniasis it is administered with pentavalent antimonial compounds
such as meglumine antimonite (Glutamine) or sodium stibogluconate (Pentosan).
With chronic treatment, allopurinol will produce progressive remission and
improvement in clinical signs associated with leishmaniasis, which include decreasing
the damaging effects of Leishmanin on the animal's kidneys by decreasing
 proteinuria and preventing deterioration of GFR.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
for leishmaniasis for several months, no adverse effects were reported.
Contraindications and Precautions
No contraindications reported for animals.
Drug Interactions
Allopurinol may inhibit drug metabolism of certain drugs. Do not use with
azathiopnine because it interferes with xanthine oxidase, an important enzyme for
metabolizing azathiopnine, and will enhance toxicity.
Instructions for Use
 In people, allopurinol is used primarily for treating gout.
In animals, it is used to decrease formation of uric acid uroliths and for treating
signs associated with leishmaniasis. No single drug or combination is completely
Allopurinol is usually administered with other drugs for leishmaniasis. For example,
18  Alprazolam
it has been administered with either amphotericin B or pentavalent antimonial
compounds such as meglumine antimonite (Glutamine) or sodium stibogluconate
(Pentosan).
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
 Dose adjustments for treating leishmaniasis are based on monitoring clinical signs.
 Allopurinol will not cure the underlying disease, but it will decrease some clinical
signs.
Formulations
Allopurinol is available in 100- and 300-mg tablets.
Stability and Storage
 Store in well-closed containers at room temperature. Allopurinol is stable for at least

al-pray'zoe-lam
Trade and other names: Xanax and Niravam
Functional classification: Tranquilizer, CNS depressant
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Benzodiazepine. Central-acting central nervous system (CNS) depressant.
Mechanism of action appears to be via potentiation of GABA-receptor mediated
effects in CNS. A drug that has similar effects is diazepam.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Alprazolam is used to treat behavior problems in dogs and cats, particularly those
associated with anxiety. Alprazolam has been used in dogs for the short-term
thunderstorm phobia, it may be more effective if combined with long-term
clomipramine treatment.
Alprazolam 19
Precautionary Information
A
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Sedation is the most common side effect, but alprazolam may also cause
paradoxical excitement in dogs. It also causes polyphagia. In cats, idiopathic fatal
from alprazolam, probably because of differences in metabolism. Alprazolam is
not as extensively metabolized as diazepam. Chronic administration in any species
may lead to dependence and a withdrawal syndrome if discontinued.
Contraindications and Precautions
No serious contraindications. In rare individuals, benzodiazepines have caused
paradoxical excitement.
Drug Interactions
Other drugs may decrease hepatic metabolism (e.g., ketoconazole,
chloramphenicol, and itraconazole).
Instructions for Use
Use in animals has been primarily derived from empirical use. There are no well-
controlled clinical studies or effcacy trials to document clinical effectiveness.
Duration of effect is only 2-3 hours in many dogs. Therefore, if needed, more
frequent administration may be required.
When treating thunderstorm phobia, it is helpful in some dogs to
administer 0.02 mg/kg of clomipramine l hour before a storm, in addition to
alprazolam.
The Niravam tablets (see formulation section) are rapidly dissolving and may be
easier to administer to animals that are difficult to medicate. Tablets easily dissolve
on the tongue without requiring water and can be cut for accurate dosing.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests

Altrenogest
al-tren'-oh-jest
Trade and other names: Regu-Mate, Matrix
Functional classification: Hormone
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Altrenogest is an active synthetic progestin hormone. As a progesterone agonist,

predictable occurrence of estrous activity after the drug is discontinued. Therefore, it
is used to induce a normal cycle of estrous activitiy to facilitate scheduled breeding.
When treatment is initiated, 95% of the mares will have an estrous cycle suppressed
in 3 days.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Altrenogest is indicated to suppress estrus in animals to facilitate induction of
normal estrous cycle activity. It is used in mares to facilitate scheduled breeding
activity. It is also used to suppress estrous behavior in performance horses. When
treatment is discontinued, mares exhibiting regular estrous cycles return to estrus
within 4 to 5 days following treatment and continue to cycle normally.
In swine altrenogest is used for synchronization of estrus in sexually mature gilts
that have had at least one estrous cycle. Do not use in gilts having a previous or
Current history of uterine inflammation {i.e., acute, subacute, or chronic
endometnitis).
Precautionary Information
Contraindications and Precautions
 Do not administer to pregnant animals. Humans handling altrenogest,
particularly women, should wear gloves and avoid contact because altrenogest can

Trade and other names: Aluminum hydroxide gel (Amphogel) and aluminum
carbonate gel (Basalgel)
Functional classification: Antacid
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Aluminum is an antacid and phosphate binder in intestine. It is used in both the
aluminum hydroxide and aluminum carbonate formulations.
Indications and Clinical Uses
A common use of aluminum hydroxide is for its antacid properties to treat
or manage gastrointestinal ulcers. Also, it is used as a phosphate binder. It is
indicated in animals with hyperphosphatemia associated with chronic renal failure,
often in combination with phosphorus-restricted diets. Because of the decreased
availability of products containing aluminum, other drugs are used to decrease
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
These aluminium-containing compounds are generally safe. However, there has
aluminum, which may lead to some forms of aluminum toxicoses. The evidence
for this as a clinical problem in veterinary medicine is lacking.
Contraindications and Precautions
Aluminum decreases oral absorption of some drugs (e.g., fluoroquinolones,
tetracyclines). If fluoroquinolone antimicrobials are used concurrently, separation
of oral doses should be considered.
Drug Interactions
Aluminum will bind and chelate some drugs and prevent the gastrointestinal
antibiotics.

Amantadine
ah-man'tah-deen
Trade and other names: Symmetrel and generic brands
Functional classification: Antiviral
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Amantadine is an antiviral drug. The action against viruses is not entirely known.
For treating other conditions in people (Parkinson's disease) its effects are attributed
to an increase in dopamine in the central nervous system (CNS). However it also is
an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. As an NMDA antagonist, it
will decrease tolerance to other analgesic drugs (e.g., opiates), but it probably does
not possess many analgesic properties when used alone. Pharmacokinetics have not

administration in people and crosses the blood-brain barrier.
A
Indications and Clinical Uses
Amantadine is an antiviral drug used to treat influenza infections in people. It also is
those that are dnug induced. It also has been used to manage muscular weakness in
humans with multiple sclerosis. However, its use in veterinary medicine has primarily
been for treating pain in dogs and cats. It is used for treating pain when other drugs
have been ineffective or when it is desirable to use in combination with multiple
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Toxicity has not been seen in dogs and cats until doses are exceeded by at least
two times. Rarely, the side effects of anxiety states and dry mouth have been
observed. Dizziness, confusion, and other CNS disturbances have been reported
in people.
Contraindications and Precautions
Pregnancy caution: Amantadine is embryotoxic and teratogenic at high doses in
laboratory animals. Avoid its use in pregnancy.
Drug Interactions
 Do not use with other drugs that increase dopamine concentrations (e.g.,
selegiline). If used with other CNS stimulants, it may enhance the effects.
Instructions for Use
Amantadine for treatment of pain may not be effective when used alone. Administer
with another analgesic agent (e.g., NSAID) for best results. Antiviral effects have
not been adequately explored in animals. In people, antiviral dose is I.5-3 mg/kg
once or twice a day.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
No specific monitoring is necessary.
Formulations

24  Amikacin
Amikacin
am-ih-kay'sin
Trade and other names: Amiglyde-V (veterinary preparation), Amikin (human
preparation), and generic brands
Functional classification: Antibacterial
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Aminoglycoside antibiotic. Action is to inhibit bacteria protein synthesis via binding
to 30S ribosome. Amikacin is bactericidal with a broad spectrum of activity except
against streptococci and anaerobic bacteria. Amikacin may have activity against many
bacteria, especially gram-negative bacilli, that are resistant to other drugs. Amikacin
adsa q a a i u  aae  sq A
enteric species. In most animals, the half-life is short (l-2 hours), and volume of
distribution reflects extracellular body water (e.g., 200-250 mL/kg). Amikacin is
not absorbed from oral administration.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Amikacin is indicated in bacterial infections, especially for treatment of serious
infections caused by gram-negative bacteria. When resistance to gentamicin is
anticipated, amikacin is often used in its place. In horses, amikacin also is used for
local administration as an intrauterine lavage to treat metritis and other infections of
the genital tract caused by gram-negative bacteria. In horses, amikacin also is used
for regional limb perfusion.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Nephrotoxicity is the most dose-limiting toxicity. Ensure that patients have
adequate fluid and electrolyte balance during therapy. Ototoxicity and
vestibulotoxicity also are possible.
Contraindications and Precautions
 Do not use in animals with renal insufficiency or renal failure. Do not use in
dehydrated animals.
Drug Interactions
Do not mix in vial or syninge with other antibiotics. Amikacin is incompatible
with other drugs and compounds when mixed in the same vial or syringe. This
effect is particularly important when mixing with other antibiotics. When used
with anesthetic agents, neuromuscular blockade is possible.
Instructions for Use
Once-daily doses are designed to maximize peak-to-minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) ratio. Consider therapeutic dnug monitoring to decrease risk of
renal toxicosis. Activity against some bacteria (e.g., Psendomonas) is enhanced when
combined with a beta-lactam antibiotic. Nephrotoxicity is increased with persistently
high trough concentrations.

Functional classification: Anticholinergic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antidiarrheal drug. Anticholinergic (blocks acetylcholine at parasympathetic
synapse). Like other anticholinergic drugs in this class, aminopentamide blocks
Aminophylline  27
muscarinic receptors. As a result of blockade, effects of acetylcholine are blocked to
inhibit gastrointestinal secretions and smooth muscle motility. Glandular, respiratory,
and other physiologic functions also can be affected. Aminopentamide is an older
drug that is not often used as a treatment of diarrhea or gastrointestial diseases
today.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Aminopentamide has been used to decrease GI motility and decrease GI secretions
in animals. It also has been used to treat diarrhea, but long-term use for this
purpose is not recommended.
Instructions for Use
Dosing guidelines based on manufacturer's recommendation.

Aminophylline
am-in-offrih-lin
Trade and other names: Generic brands
Functional classification: Bronchodilator
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Bronchodilator. Aminophylline is a salt of theophylline, formulated to
enhance oral absorption without gastric side effects. It is converted to
are the same as theophylline. Consult the theophyline monograph for more details.
Theophylline's action is to inhibit phosphodiesterase (PDE) and increase cyclic
AMP. Other antinflammatory mechanisms also may play a role in its clinical
effects.
28  Aminophylline
Indications and Clinical Uses
Aminophylline is indicated for control of reversible airway constriction, to prevent
bronchoconstriction, and as an adjunct with other respiratory disease treatment.
The uses are similar to the indications for theophylline because it is a salt form of
theophylline. It is used for inflammatory airway disease in cats (feline asthma), dogs,
and horses. In dogs, the uses include collapsing trachea, bronchitis, and other airway
diseases. It has not been effective for respiratory diseases in cattle.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Aminophylline causes excitement and possible cardiac side effects with high
concentrations. Cardiac adverse effects include tachycardia and arrhythmias.
Gastrointestinal adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Central
nervous system adverse effects include excitement, tremors, and seizures.
Contraindications and Precautions
Although adverse effects appear more common in people than small animals, use
cautiously in animals with cardiac arrhythmias. Use cautiously in animals prone to
seizures. Horses may become excited from IV administration.
Drug Interactions
 Use cautiously with other phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as sildenafl (Viagra)
and pimobendan. Many drugs will inhibit the metabolism of theophylline
and potentially increase concentrations (e.g., cimetidine, erythromycin,
fluoroquinolones, and propranolol). Some drugs will decrease concentrations by
increasing metabolism (e.g., phenobarbital and rifampin).
Instructions for Use
Therapeutic drug monitoring of theophylline is recommended for accurate dosing
during chronic therapy. When dosing with salts or other formulations of
theophylline, adjust dose for the amount of the parent drug.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Plasma concentrations of theophylline should be monitored in patients receiving
therapy with aminophylline. Targeted plasma concentrations range from 1l0 to
20 mcg/mL, but clinical effects may occur as low as 5 mcg/mL.
Formulations
Aminophylline is available in 100 -and 200-mg tablets and 25-mg/mL injection.
A dose of 25 mg/mL of anhydrous aminophylline is equivalent to 19.7 mg of
anhydrous theophylline per mL.

RCI Classification: 3
Amiodarone Hydrochloride
ah-mee-oe'dah-rone
Trade and other names: Cordarone
Functional classification: Antiarrhythmic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
blocking the outward potassium channel in cardiac tissues. Amiodarone prolongs the
action potential, delays myocardial repolarization, and delays the refractory period in
cardiac tissues. It also may have some alpha-adrenergic receptor, beta-adrenergic
receptor, and calcium-channel blocking properties. Half-life is several days in
duration, and in some animals the half-life may be as long as l00 days with
chronic therapy. In horses the terminal half-life was 38-84 hours. The intravenous
formulation of amiodarone uses Polysorbate 80 to enhance solubility, which may
be responsible for some of the adverse reactions. There is a new non-iodinated
derivative, dronedarone (Multaq), that is less lipophilic, has a shorter half-life, and
may be safer, but there has been no use reported in animals.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Amiodarone is used to treat refractory ventricular arrhythmias. It is reserved for
treating life-threatening arrhythmias that have been refractory to other treatments. It
has been used as a last resort for recurrent hemodynamically unstable ventricular
tachycardia.
In horses, IV amidarone has been used to treat atrial fibrillation.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Most common effect in dogs is decreased appetite. Prolonged Q-T interval is a
concern. Other adverse effects include bradycardia, CHF, hypotension, AV block.
thyroid dysfunction (decreased T3 and T4), pulmonary fibrosis, neutropenia, and
30 Amiodarone Hydrochloride
anemia. Hepatopathy is a serious concern and has been reported in dogs.
Doberman dogs were particularly affected by amiodarone when treated for
arrhythmias; there was a high incidence of adverse effects that included anorexia,
lethargy, hepatic toxicity, and vomiting. In one study, doses up to 12.5 mg/kg
IV produced no acute cardiovascular reactions; however, with acute intravenous
administration, severe cardiac reactions, hypotension, vasodilation, pnuritus, and
edema (including swollen extremities) are possible. Adverse effects caused by IV
treatment may be caused by the drug vehicle included to enhance solubility,
Polysorbate 80, which is known to elicit allergic-type adverse events caused by
histamine release. Pre-treatment with antihistamines may help to decrease adverse
events caused by IV treatment.
No adverse clinical signs were observed in horses after single administration
IV, but for treating atrial fbrillation, mild signs of shifting weight and hind limb
weakness were reported.
Contraindications and Precautions
Severe reactions including hepatopathy and cardiac arrhythmias have been seen in
dogs. Use only when arrhythmia has been refractory to other treatments or when
dogs are at risk for sudden death.
Drug Interactions
Use amiodarone with beta blockers, calcium-channel blockers, and digoxin
cautiously because it may slow conduction. Do not mix intravenous solution with
mixtures containingbicarbonate.
Instructions for Use
Typically, loading doses are administered, followed by maintenance dose. Oral
dosing in dogs has used 10-15 mg/kg ql2h for 1 week, then 5-7.5 mg/kg ql2h
for 2 weeks, followed by maintenance dose of 7.5 mg/kg q24h. If intravenous
therapy is used, doses should be given slowly; initial infusion rate should not exceed
30 mg per minute. Prior to IV treatment, administer antihistamines to prevent
allergic-type reactions.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Because of a concem for adverse effects caused by amiodarone in dogs,
therapy should be monitored carefully. It is highly recommended to monitor CBC
 for anemia and neutropenia and monitor hepatic indices with biochemical profile
during treatment. Monitor ECG during treatment as prolonged Q-T interval may
occur. Monitor thyroid finction during treatment. Drug monitoring may be
 available from some hospitals. Therapeutic range of amiodarone in plasma is
1-2.5 mcg/mL.
Formulations
Amiodarone is available in 100-, 200-, 300-, and 400-mg tablets and
50-mg/mL injection. A new fomulation (PMl0l) uses a different vehicle to
enhance solubility, rather than Polysorbate 80. This vehicle, beta-cyclodextrin
(Captisol), forms a hydrophilic central core and is less likely to elicit an allergic-type
reaction.
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room
temperature.

Amitraz
am'ih-traz
Trade and other names: Mitaban
Functional classification: Antiparasitic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antiparasitic drug for ectoparasites. Amitraz inhibits monoamine oxidase (MAO) in
mites. Mammals are resistant to this inhibition. However, administration of amitraz
can interact with other MAO inhibitors (MAOIs).
Indications and Clinical Uses
Amitraz is indicated for the topical treatment of mites, including Demodex. It is
applied topically as a dip or sponge-on. It should not be administered systemically.
The approved dose is effective in many animals; however, in more resistant cases of
Demodex, higher doses have been applied. As the dose increases, the risk of adverse
effects also increases.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Amitraz causes sedation in dogs caused by the agonist activity on alpha2
adrenergic receptors, which may be reversed by yohimbine or atipamezole. When
high doses are used, other side effects reported include pruritus, polyunia/

Functional classification: Behavior modification, tricyclic antidepressant (TCA)
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
TCA drug. Amitriptyline, like other TCAs, acts via inhibition of uptake of serotonin
Amitriptyline Hydrochloride33
cystitis is unknown but may be either through reducing anxiety, behavior
modification, or via anticholinergic effects.
A
Indications and Clinical Uses
Like other TCAs, amitriptyline is used in animals to treat a variety of behavioral
disorders (e.g., anxiety). However, there are few studies documenting efficacy in
animals. For treatment of some disorders, such as obsessive compulsive disorder
(l mg/kg ql2h up to 2 mg/kg), it was not as effective in animals as clomipramine.
For treatment of aggressive behavior in dogs (2 mg/kg ql2h) there was no
difference between amitriptyline and placebo.
Amitriptyline has been used in cats for chronic idiopathic cystitis. However,
when used for short-term treatment of idiopathic cystitis (10 mg per cat, q24h) it
was not effective. In another study, at 5 mg/cat per day for 7 days (0.55-1.2 mg/
kg), there was no difference on recovery from hematuria and pollakiuria between
amitryptiline and placebo, leading to a conclusion that short-term treatment is not
helpful.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Amitriptyline has a bitter taste and is difficult to administer orally. Multiple side
effects are associated with TCAs, such as antimuscarinic effects (dry mouth and
rapid heart rate) and antihistamine effects (sedation). High doses can produce
lfe-threatening cardiotoxicity. In cats, reduced grooming, weight gain, and
sedation are possible.
Contraindications and Precautions
 Use cautiously in patients with heart disease.
Drug Interactions
Do not use with other behavior modification drugs, such as serotonin reuptake
inhibitors. Do not use with monoamine oxidase inhibitors {MAOIs).
Instructions for Use
 Doses are primarily based on empiricism. There are no controlled effcacy trials
available for animals. There is evidence for success treating idiopathic cystitis in cats
(J Am Vet Med Assoc, 213: 1282-1286, 1998). Amitriptyline was not effective for
treatment of aggressive behavior in dogs, compared to behavior modification alone
(J Am Anim Hosp Assoc, 37: 325-330, 200l). Amitriptyline applied transdermally is
not systemically absorbed in cats.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor patient's cardiovascular status during therapy, such as heart rate and
rhythm. Like other TCAs, amitriptyline may decrease total T4 and free-T4
concentrations in dogs.
Formulations
Amitriptyline is available in 10-, 25-, 50-, 75-, 100-, and 150-mg tablets injection
off market in US.
Stability and Storage

Amoxicillin generally has a narrow spectrum of activity that includes streptococci,
Amoxicillin 37
non-beta-lactamase-producing staphylococci, and other gram-positive cocci and
bacilli. Many Staphylococcns strains are resistant owing to beta-lactamase production.
Most enteric gram-negative bacilli of the Enterobacteriaceae are resistant. Susceptible
gram-negative bacteria include some species of Protens, Pastenrella mnltocidn, and
In dogs the peak concentration, half-life, volume of distribution (VD/F), and
clearance (CL/F) are 11 mcg/mL, 1.3 hours, 0.72 L/kg, and 6.5 mL/kg/min,
respectively. In cats, these values are 12 mcg/mL, 1.4 hours, 1.05 L/kg, and
7.8 mL/kg/min, respectively. Amoxicillin oral absorption in small animals is higher
 ode ea x (s  un  s o) uidn 
adult horses is <lo% and is not recommended.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Amoxicillin is used for a variety of infections in all species, including urinary tract
infection, soft tissue infections, and pneumonia. It is generally more effective for
infections caused by gram-positive bacteria. Because of a short half-life, frequent
administration is needed for treating gram-negative infections. In addition, break
point for susceptibility is higher for gram-negative versus gram-positive organisms.
Oral absorption in horses is <l0%, and it is not suitable for treatment of adult
horses. However, oral absorption in foals is 36%-43%. Oral absorption in small
animals is 50%-60%.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Amoxicillin is usually well tolerated. Allergic reactions are possible. Diarrhea and
vomiting are common with oral doses. Oral administration to horses or cattle can
cause diarrhea and/or entenitis
Contraindications and Precautions
Drug Interactions
Do not mix with other drugs in compounded formulations
Instructions for Use
Dose recommendations vary depending on the susceptibility of bacteria and location
of infection. Generally, more frequent or higher doses are needed for gram-negative
infections.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Susceptibility testing: For testing for susceptibility, the CLSI recommends using
ampicillin to test for amoxicillin susceptibilitiy. The CLSI break point for sensitive
organisms is <0.25 mcg/mL for staphylococci, streptococci, and gram-negative
bacilli. For canine urninary tract pathogens, use a break point of <8 mcg/mL. For
cattle pathogens, use a break point of <0.25 mcg/mL. For equine respiratory
pathogens (streptococci), use a break point of <0.25 mcg/mL.

ah-mox-ih-sill'in + klav-yoo-lan'ate poe-tah'see-um
Trade and other names: Clavamox (veterinary preparation) and Augmentin
(human preparation)
Functional classification: Antibacterial
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Beta-lactam antibiotic + beta-lactamase inhibitor (clavulanate potassium). Amoxicillin
activity and spectrum are as described for amoxicillin. Clavulanate has no antibactenial
effects alone, but it is a strong inhibitor of the beta-lactamase enzyme that causes
resistance among gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. By adding clavulanate to
amoxicillin, the spectrum is extended to include beta-lactamase-producing strains of
Staphylococcws(non-methicillin resistant) and many strains of gram-negative bacilli.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Amoxicillin + clavulanate is a broad-spectrum antibacterial dnug used for skin and
soft tissue infections, UTIs, wound infections, and respiratory infections. It is
indicated for treatment of bacterial infections (gram-positive and gram-negative) that
may otherwise be resistant to amoxicillin owing to bacterial beta-lactamase
production.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
It is usually well tolerated. Allergic reactions are possible. Diarrhea is common
with oral doses and has also caused vomiting in some animals. As the dose of
clavulanate increases because of a high proportion of clavulanate in some
formulations, vomiting is more likely.
Amoxicillin + Clavulanate Potassium 39
Contraindications and Precautions
A
Use cautiously in animals allergic to penicillin-like drugs. Oral administration to
horses and ruminants may produce diarrhea.
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions are reported in animals.
Instructions for Use
Dose recommendations vary depending on the susceptibility of bacteria and location
of infection. Generally, more frequent or higher doses are needed for gram-negative
infections. It has been the experience of many veterinarians that an oral dose of
double the manufacturer's recommendation should be used for treating skin
infections (i.e., 25 mg/kg ql2h). Oral human dose forms are sometimes substituted
for veterinary drugs. Note that veterinary dose formulations contain amoxicillin and
clavulanate in a 4 : l ratio. Human dose forms (Augmentin) contain these drugs in
ratios of 2:1 to as high as 7:1.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Susceptibility testing: CLSI break point for sensitive organisms is <0.25/0.12 mcg/
mL for staphylococci, streptococci, E. coli, and Pastenrella mnitocida. (The “/"

Amphotericin B
am-foe-tare'ih-sin
Trade and other names: Fungizone (traditional fommulation) and liposomal

Functional classification: Antifungal
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antifungal drug. Amphotericin B is a fungicidal agent for systemic fungi.
a loss of membrane integrity, leakiness, and cell death. Amphotericin is active
against most fungi and some protozoa. There is a conventional formulation of
amphotericin B deoxycholate that has been used most often in veterinary medicine.
It is the least expensive but the most toxic. Lipid fomulations of amphotericin B are
now available. They are widely used in people but have not gained widespread use
in veterinary medicine because of their high cost. The advantage of liposomal
fomulations over the traditional formulations is that they are less toxic. These new
fomulations are lipid-based complexes or cholesteryl complexes of amphotericin B
that allow higher doses to be administered with less nephrotoxicity. Amphotericin B
ipid complex (Abelcet, ABLC) is a suspension of amphotericin B complexed with
two phospholipids at a concentration of l00 mg/20 mL. This formulation was
dose of 8-12 mg/kg by administering 1 mg/kg every other day. Amphotericin B
cholesteryl sulfate complex (Amphotec, ABCD) is a colloidal dispersion of
amphotericin B. It has been effective in studies in which it was administered at
doses higher than the traditional amphotenicin B formulation. The liposomal
complex of amphotericin B (AmBisome) is a unilaminar liposomal formulation.
When reconstituted, it produces small vesicles of encapsulated amphotericin B.
This formulation has been used safely and effectively in some dogs for
blastomycosis.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Amphotericin B is indicated in patients with a variety of systemic mycoses. It is used
to treat blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, and histoplasmosis. It also has been used
to treat leishmaniasis in dogs. It may be administered for treatment of aspergillosis,
 but this is not a common use in veterinary medicine and some species of Aspergillus
are resistant.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Amphotericin B produces a dose-related nephrotoxicity. It also produces fever,
phlebitis, and tremors. Renal toxicity is dose-dependent and cumulative. It is
more likely when cumulative doses approach, or exceed, 6 mg/kg. With repeated
use, amphotericin B can cause renal potassium wasting because of loss of
potassium in the collecting duct.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not use in patients who have renal disease or where renal clearance is
not known. Do not use in dehydrated animals or animals with electrolyte
imbalances.
Amphotericin B 4l
Drug Interactions
A
When preparing intravenous solution, do not mix Amphotericin B with
electrolyte solutions; instead use 5% dextrose in water. Nephrotoxicity is
ncreased when administered with aminoglycosides
Instructions for Use
Administer IV via slow infusion diluted in 5% dextrose in water and monitor renal
function closely. Administer sodium chloride fluid loading IV to patients before
therapy to decrease risk of renal toxicosis. One study administered amphotericin B
subcutaneously (Aust Vet J, 73: 124, 1996). Amphotenicin B has been mixed as a
solution of amphotericin B (one vial of 50 mg) with 40 mL of sterile water and
10 mL of Intralipid 10% (soybean oil). Doses of this mixture of 1-2 mg/kg have
been used for treating systemic leishmaniasis. For other indications, this mixture has

treatments. This liposomal complex of amphotericin B was used in a study for
treatment of canine Leishmania infantum at a dose of 3-3.3 mg/kg. Although there
label carefully. For administration of Abelcet, dilute in 5% dextrose to l mg/mL has
been infused over l-2 hours.
For intrathecal use, use the conventional formulation only. Start with 0.05 (total
dose) every 48 hours, and increase to 0.1 and 0.2 mg (total dose) if the animal
tolerates it well. Prepare intrathecal solution with a 5 mg/mL solution in sterile
water further diluting to 0.25 mg/mL by adding l mL (5 mg) of the solution to
another 19 mL of 5% dextrose and inject directly intrathecally.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor renal function closely during treatment. After treatment many animals will
have an elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen. Persistent azotemia may be a
cause for discontinuation of treatment and replacement with another antifungal
agent. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia may occur during use because of renal
tubular acidosis.
Formulations
The conventional form of amphotericin B is available in a 50-mg injectable vial.
Stability and Storage
Stable if stored in original vial. Amphotericin B for intravenous infusion will react
with light and should be protected from light during infusions. Store reconstituted
solutions in refrigeration. However, unrefrigerated solutions may be stable for up to
1 week. Optimum pH is 6-7.
Small Animal Dosage
Dogs
Conventional formulation: 0.5 mg/kg q48 h IV (slow infusion) to a cumulative
dose of 4-8 mg/kg. The liposomal formulations are administered at a dose of
3 mg/kg/day at a rate of more than 60-120 minutes for up to 9-12 treatments.
This dose may be administered three times per week, rather than every day. A goal
for the total cumulative dose for liposomal formulations is 24-27 mg/kg.
Intrathecal use: See previous instructions. Start with 0.05 (total dose) every
48 hours, and increase to 0.l and 0.2 mg (total dose)

preparations)
Functional classification: Antibactenial
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Beta-lactam antibiotic. Ampicillin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis. Ampicillin
has a narrow spectrum of activity that is similar to that of amoxicillin. Ampicillin
generally has a spectrum of activity that includes streptococci, non-beta-lactamase-
producing staphylococci, and many other gram-positive cocci and bacilli. Many
staphylococci are resistant owing to beta-lactamase production. Most enteric
negative bacteria include some species of Proteus, Pastewrella mnltocida, and
Histophilus. Resistance among gram-negative bacteria is common. It generally has
a broad spectrum of activity that includes both gram-positive and gram-negative
bacteria. However, resistance is common, especially among enteric gram-negative
bacilli and staphylococci.
Pharmacokinetics of ampicillin indicated that the half-life is approximately
1-1.5 hours in most animals. Half-life in horses is 0.6-1.5 hours after intravenous
administration but longer after intramuscular injection. When the trihydrate
fomulation is injected IM, it produces a lower peak concentration but a longer
half-life of 6.7 hours in cattle. Volume of distribution in most species is
approximately 0.2 L/kg. Systemic clearance is approximately 3-5 mL/kg/min in
most animals. Oral absorption is less than 50% in dogs and cats and less than 4% in
horses.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Ampicillin is indicated in patients with infections caused by susceptible bacteria, such
as skin and soft tissue infections, UTIs, and pneumonia. Gram-positive bacteria
(except beta-lactamase-producing strains of Sta phylococcns) are usually susceptible.

Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
This can range from acute anaphylaxis when administered IV to other signs of
allergic reaction when other routes are used. When used for prophylaxis during
 surgery, ampicillin can be administered IV to anesthetized patients without
affecting cardiovascular parameters. Diarhea is possible, when administered
orally, especially with high doses.
Contraindications and Precautions
 Use cautiously in animals allergic to penicillin-like drugs. Ampicillin contains
3 mEq of sodium per gram.
Drug Interactions
 Do not mix in vials with other drugs.
Instructions for Use
Dose requirements vary depending on susceptibility of bacteria. It is absorbed
approximately 50% less compared to amoxicillin when administered orally. More
gram-negative bacilli and enterococci.
When preparing injectable solutions, the stability is dependent on the
concentration. Concentrated solutions (250 mg/mL) should be injected within
one hour of reconstitution either IM, SC, or slowly (over 3 minutes) IV. Less
concentrated solutions prepared in intravenous fluids (e.g., 30 mg/mL) are stable
for longer periods. See Stability and Storage section below for more detail.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Susceptibility testing: For testing for susceptibility, CLSI break point for sensitive
organisms is <0.25 mcg/mL for staphylocicci, streptococci, and gram-negative
bacilli. For canine urinary tract pathogens, use a break point of <8 mcg/mL. For

Ampicillin + Sulbactam
am-pih-sillin + sul-bak'tam
Trade and other names: Unasyn
Functional classification: Antibacterial
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
The ampicillin component has the same spectrum and mechanism of action as
described for ampicillin previously. This formulation contains ampicillin plus a
beta-lactamase inhibitor (sulbactam). Sulbactam has similar activity as clavulanate
(ingredient in amoxicillin-clavulanate), but it is not as active as clavulanate against
some gram-negative enzymes (e.g., TEM). Because of the addition of sulbactam, it
has a broader spectrum of activity than ampicillin alone. The spectrum includes
beta-lactamase-producing strains of Staphylococcus and gram-negative bacilli.
Indications and Clinical Uses
This combination is indicated for general bacterial infections. It has been used
for acute infections such as pneumonia, sepsis, and prophylaxis in patients with
neutropenia. Because of the addition of sulbactam, it has a broader spectrum than
ampicillin alone. Therefore, it is used for treating infections for which ampicillin

Apomorphine Hydrochloride
ah-poe-mor'feen hye-droe-klor'-ide
Trade and other names: Apokyn and generic brands
Functional classification: Emetic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
dd i   sr ui sd () d ss  
causes vomiting in dogs. Although it is easily absorbed from mucosal surfaces (e.g,
conjunctiva of the eye), it is not absorbed orally because of first-pass effects
Indications and Clinical Uses
agents. After subcutaneous administration, the onset of effect is l0 minutes or
shorter. It is promptly effective for inducing vomiting in dogs but less so in cats.
Apomorphine also is absorbed from mucosal administration after applying to the
conjuctiva of the eye. Xylazine often is a more reliable emetic in cats.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Apomorphine produces emesis before serious adverse effects can occur, but at
higher doses (0.l mg/kg) sedation can occur, which can mask the signs of some
toxic agents. The hydrochlonide salt of this fomulation has a pH of 3-4 and can
be irritating to the ocular conjunctival membranes. At high doses (l mg/kg)
excitement can occur, possibly via stimulation of dopamine (D, and D2)
receptors.
Contraindications and Precautions
Use cautiously in cats that may be sensitive to opiates.
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions are reported in animals. However, some drugs will diminish
the emetic action of apomorphine (e.g., acepromazine, atropine, and other
antiemetics).
Instructions for Use
be available in most emergency practices for prompt treatment of poisoning.
Apomorphine can be administered IM, SC, or to the mucosa (e.g., in the
48  Aprepitant
conjunctival sac of the eye). In dogs, vomiting should occur within 3-10 minutes
after administration. Limit administration to once.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
No specifc monitoring is necessary. If used to induce vomiting from a toxicant,
monitor for signs of toxicity because vomiting is able to eliminate less than half of
the ingested toxicant.
Formulations
Apomorphine is available in 6-mg tablets that can be hydrolyzed prior to use or in a
10-mg/mL concentration in a 2-mL ampule or 3-mL preloaded syringes. It has also
been prepared by compounding pharmacists.
Stability and Storage
Solutions decompose when exposed to air and light. A green color indicates
decomposition. Store in a tightly sealed container at room temperature.
Small Animal Dosage
Dogs and Cats
· 0.03-0.05 mg/kg IV or IM.
· 0.1 mg/kg SQ.
· Dissolve 6-mg tablet in l-2 mL of saline and instill directly in conjunctiva of eye.
After animal vomits, the conjunctiva may be rinsed of residual drug with an eye
wash solution.
Large Animal Dosage
No dose has been reported for large animals.
Regulatory Information
Do not administer to animals intended for food.
RCI Classifcation: 1
Aprepitant
 ap-reh'pih-tant 
Trade and other names: Emend
Functional classification: Antiemetic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Aprepitant is a centrally acting antiemetic. Aprepitant is a substance P/neurokinin 1
(NK,) receptor antagonist, similar to maropitant (Cerenia). It is used primarily with
drugs known to be highly emetic, such as cisplatin. This drug is effective because
chemotherapy drugs and other emetic stimuli release NK,, which is highly emetic. It
also blocks vomiting from other stimuli. The use in small animals has been
somewhat limited because of the high expense and limited fomulations for animals.
In dogs, aprepitant is extensively metabolized after administration.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Aprepitant is an effective antiemetic for people, particularly when used to treat
vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy. It may be used with corticosteroids
Ascorbic Acid49
(dexamethasone) and serotonin (5HT3) antagonists. However, despite its broad
effects to decrease vomiting in people, there are no reports of effective use in dogs
D
or cats. Instead, a similar-acting drug, maropitant (Cerenia), is used in dogs and cats
and produces similar antiemetic effects.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
There are no reported adverse effects in animals.
Contraindications and Precautions
No contraindications reported for animals.
Drug Interactions
Drug interactions are possible because aprepitant is both an inducer and inhibitor
of cytochrome P450 enzymes. Potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (see
 Appendix F) can potentially affect aprepitant clearance.
Instructions for Use
Use in patients refractory to other antiemetic drugs. It may be combined with other
antiemetics.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
No specific monitoring is necessary.
Formulations
Aprepitant is available in 80- and 125-mg capsules
Stability and Storage
 Do not crush or mix capsules. Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from
light, and at room temperature.
Small Animal Dosage
Dogs and Cats
· Start with l mg/kg q24h PO and increase to 2 mg/kg in refractory patients.
Large Animal Dosage
No dose has been reported for large animals.

Ascorbic Acid
ah-skor'bik assid
Trade and other names: Vitamin C and sodium ascorbate. There are many
brand names available.
Functional classification: Vitamin
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Ascorbic acid is vitamin C. It is an important cofactor in a variety of metabolic
functions.
50   Ascorbic Acid
Indications and Clinical Uses
Ascorbic acid is used to treat vitamin C deficiency and occasionally used as urine
acidifer. Dogs are capable of synthesizing vitamin C, but it is used as a supplement
to improve health and performance. There are insuffcient data to show that ascorbic
acid is effective for preventing cancer, treating infectious diseases, or preventing
cardiovascular disease.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects have not been reported in animals. High doses may increase the
nisk of oxalate urolith formation.
Contraindications and Precautions
No contraindications reported for animals.
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions are reported in animals.
Instructions for Use
Not necessary to supplement in animals with well-balanced diets. However, high
doses have been used as adjunctive treatment for some diseases. Evidence shows that
at doses of 15 and 50 mg/kg in dogs, the increase in absorption was nonlinear.
Therefore, higher doses may not produce proportionately higher blood levels to the
lower doses. Comparison of crystalline ascorbic acid and the vitamin C product,
Ester-C, produced similar levels of vitamin C in the plasma
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
No specific monitoring is necessary.
Formulations
Ascorbic acid is available in tablets of various sizes and injections. Typically the
injection form is 250 mg sodium ascorbate/mL. The fomulation of Ester-C appears
to be absorbed similarly to the crystalline form of vitamin C.
Stability and Storage
Light sensitive. It will oxidize, darken, and decompose when exposed to air and
light. The injectable solution in a vial may build up pressure with storage, which
may be decreased by storing in a reffigerator. Otherwise, store at room temperature
protected from light.
Small Animal Dosage
Dogs and Cats
· Dietary supplementation: 100-500 mg/animal/day PO.
· Urinary acidification: 100 mg/animal q8h PO. Injectable dose ranges from
1-10 mL (250 mg per mL), depending on size of animal, IM or IV.

Asparaginase (L-Asparaginase) S1
Regulatory Information
A
Withdrawal time: O days for all animals intended for food.
Asparaginase (L-Asparaginase)
ah-spar'a-jin-aze
Trade and other names: Elspar and Asparaginase
Functional classification: Anticancer agent
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Anticancer agent. Neoplastic cells are deficient in asparagine synthase and require
extracellular asparagine for DNA and RNA synthesis. L-asparaginase destroys
asparagine. Normal cells are capable of synthesizing their own asparagine, but
certain malignant cells, especially malignant lymphocytes, are not. Therefore,
asparagine is an essential amino acid for cancer cell survival, particularly malignant
lymphocytes. Because cancer cells in patients treated with L-asparaginase are
depleted of asparagine, this treatment interferes with DNA, RNA, and protein
synthesis in cancer cells. It is specific for the Gl phase of the cell cycle. In dogs it
has a long half-life of l-2 days.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Asparaginase has been used in some lymphoma protocols and has been effective for
melanoma and mast cell tumors. It has been administered IV, IM, or SQ, but
results of one study favored intramuscular administration over subcutaneous
administration. In cats it also has been used in combination cancer protocols
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
The most common adverse effect is hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions.
Asparaginase is a foreign bacterial protein and can cause allergic reactions.

administrations. Hepatotoxic reactions, pancreatitis, and hyperglycemia also have
been reported.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not use in animals with known sensitivity (allergic reaction)
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions are reported in animals. It has been used with other
anticancer drugs.
Instructions for Use
Asparaginase is usually used in combination with other drugs in cancer
chemotherapy protocols (e.g., doxorubicin). Studies have shown that intramuscular
dosing is more effective than subcutaneous dosing in dogs with lymphoma (J Am
Vet Med Assoc, 214: 353-356, 1999). Asparaginase has minimal effect on the bone
marrow; therefore, it can be used in combination with other myelosuppressive drugs
in a protocol. Although it has been used in anticancer protocols, it has shown no

should not be used in animals that produce food because it is an anticancer agent.
Aspirin
as'pir-in
Trade and other names: ASA, acetylsalicylic acid, Bufferin, Ascriptin, and many
generic brands
Functional classification: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Anti-inflammatory action is caused
(COX) enzyme in tissues to inhibit synthesis of prostaglandins. At low doses it may
be more specific for COX-l than COX-2. Anti-inflammatory effects are attributed
to inhibition of COX, but other anti-inflammatory mechanisms—attributed to
salicylates—may also contribute to the anti-inflammatory action, such as inhibition
 of NF kappa-B. Pharmacokinetics are variable in animals with a half-life that ranges
'sies ul sinoy ge on 'ssop ui sinoy s'g 'said ul sinou 9 'sasioy ul inoy I uoy
Indications and Clinical Uses
Aspirin is used as an analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antiplatelet drug. At low
doses, aspirin is a more specifc COX-l selective inhibitor and antiplatelet drug than
other NSAIDs. Therefore, low doses have been used in animals specifically to
prevent thromboemboli formation. Low doses of aspirin are routinely used for
stimulation. Addition of other antiplatelet drugs such as clopidogrel (Plavix)
Aspirin 53
provides more effective inhibition. Although aspirin has been available for many
years, it is not registered by the FDA for use in any species. There are no published
controlled studies to document efficacy. Use of aspirin in animals is primarily based
on empiricism rather than on published data.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
effects can include ulceration and bleeding. Aspirin inhibits platelets and increases
risk of bleeding.
Contraindications and Precautions
Cats are susceptible to salicylate intoxication because of slow clearance. Use
Willebrand's disease). Do not administer to animals prone to GI ulcers.
Drug Interactions
Do not administer with other ulcerogenic drugs such as corticosteroids. Do not
administer with other drugs that may cause coagulopathy and increase risk of
bleeding problems.
Instructions for Use
Analgesic and anti-inflammatory doses have primarily been derived from empiricism.
Antiplatelet doses are lower because of prolonged effect of aspinin on platelets.
Aspirin is only available in oral form. Because it is a weak acid, it is ordinarily
absorbed best in the acidic environment of the upper GI tract; however,
considerable absorption also takes place in the intestine. In dogs, enteric-coated
aspirin reduces gastric irritation, but absorption from this form is erratic and often
incomplete. Buffering does not affect absorption but may protect the stomach from
injury when high doses are administered. Buffering has less of a beneficial effect
when low doses are administered and is not expected to protect the stomach from
the more serious effects of GI ulceration, bleeding, and perforations.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor patients for signs of gastric upset, gastroduodenal ulcers, and bleeding.
200 mcg/mL for inflammation. Aspirin decreased thyroid concentrations (T4, T3,

Atovaquone
a-TOE-va-KWONE
Trade and other names: Mepron
Functional classification: Antibacterial, antiprotozoal
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Atovaquone is an antimicrobial agent, an analogue of ubiquinone, that inhibits
mitochondrial transport in protozoa by targeting the cytochrome bcj complex. It
also inhibits nucleic acid and ATP synthesis in susceptible cells. Atovaquone is active
against protozoa such as Pnewmocystitis, for which it is used in people. In cats it is
used to treat Cytauxzoon felis. It may not eradicate Cytauxzoon, but it will decrease
the parasite burden. In dogs, it has been used to treat Babesia gibsoni. For treating
these infections in dogs and cats, it appears to have an additive or synergistic effect
is almost 50% but is increased with feeding. The half-life in people is very long
(67-77 hours) but is not reported for animals.
Indications and Clinical Uses
In people, atavaquone is an antiprotozoal that is primarily used in individuals who
cannot tolerate sulfonamides. In animals, it has been used, often in combination
with azithromycin, to treat refractory protozoan diseases and bloodborne pathogens.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects

to overcome excess vagal stimulation associated with some clinical conditions.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Side effects include xerostomia, ileus, constipation, tachycardia, and urine
retention.
Contraindications and Precautions
 Do not use in patients with glaucoma, intestinal ileus, gastroparesis, or
tachycardia. Use high doses (e.g., 0.04 mg/kg) cautiously because it will increase
oxygen demand.
Drug Interactions
Do not mix with alkaline solutions. Atropine will antagonize the effects of any
cholinergic drugs administered (e.g., metoclopramide).
Instructions for Use
Atropine is used ordinarily as an adjunct with anesthesia or other procedures.
Compared to lower doses, in dogs 0.06 mg/kg was more effective than 0.02 mg/kg
(Am J Vet Res, 60: 1000-1003, 1999). Atropine may be used during cardiac
resuscitation; however, high doses may cause sustained tachycardia and increased
myocardial oxygen demand. During cardiac resuscitation, doses of 0.04 mg/kg IV
may be used, but for treating sinus bradycardia, consider lower doses of 0.0l mg/kg.

Aurothioglucose
or-oh-thye-oe-gloo'kose
Trade and other names: Solganal
Functional classification: Immunosuppressive
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Used for gold therapy (chrysotherapy). Mechanism of action is unknown but may
relate to immunosuppressive effect on lymphocytes.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Aurothioglucose (gold therapy) is used primarily for immune-mediated diseases. It
has been used with some success to control immune-mediated skin diseases, such as
 pemphigus and immune-mediated arthritis. However, because of a lack of controlled
tials to demonstrate efficacy and adverse effects that have been observed, the use in
veterinary medicine has been uncommon.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects include dermatitis, nephrotoxicity, and blood dyscrasias.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not use in animals with suppressed bone marrow or animals already receiving
bone marrow-suppressing agents.
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions are reported in animals.

Azathioprine
ay-za-thye'oe-preen
Trade and other names: Imuran and generic
Functional classification: Immunosuppressive
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Thiopurine immunosuppressive drug. Acts to inhibit T-cell lymphocyte function.
This drug is metabolized to 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), which may account for
immunosuppressive effects because 6-MP interferes with purine metabolism in
lymphocytes. Other cells can use salvage pathways for purine synthesis, but
stimulated lymphocytes are not capable of this synthesis.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Azathioprine is used to treat various immune-mediated diseases in animals, including
immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, pemphigus, and inflammatory bowel disease.
It is often administered with prednisone or prednisolone. Onset of action may be
delayed for 4-6 weeks in some patients.
64   Azathioprine
Precautionary TInformation
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
 Bone marrow suppression is the most serious concern. Additional adverse effects
Hepatotoxicosis after administration of azathiopnne also has been reported.
One of the metabolites produced may be hepatotoxic. There has been some
association with development of pancreatitis when administered with
corticosteroids. Sensitivity to the adverse effects may be because of a deficiency
of metabolizing enzymes, thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) in certain
individuals. In people, about l0% are deficient. Some dogs and many cats are also
deficient; however, in dogs toxicity has not yet been correlated with status of
TPMT levels. Cats are particularly susceptible to toxicity and are reported to have
low levels of TPMT. Individuals who have higher sensitivity to the suppressing
effects of bone marrow should have dose reduced.
Contraindications and Precautions
Exercise extreme caution and careful monitoring when administering to cats.
Drug Interactions
 oq ar ssds a i s ro  ro  s
(e.g., cyclophosphamide and anticancer drugs). There is some evidence that
concurrent use with corticosteroids may increase risk of pancreatitis. Do not
administer with allopurinol because antagonism of xanthine oxidase may interfere
with metabolism.
Instructions for Use
Azathioprine is usually used in combination with other immunosuppressive drugs
(e.g., corticosteroids) to treat immune-mediated disease. Cats are very sensitive to
the bone marrow-suppressing effects of azathioprine. Doses of 2.2 mg/kg to cats
have produced toxicity, but most experts recommend starting cats with doses of
0.3 mg/kg/day.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor patient's CBC periodically because some animals are sensitive to the effects of
azathioprine and its metabolite 6-MP. After 2 weeks of treatment, a CBC is essential.
Because of risk of hepatotoxicity, monitor hepatic enzymes and bilirubin regularly.
Formulations
Azathioprine is available in 25-, 50-, 75-, and 100-mg tablets and 10-mg/mL for
injection.
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container at room temperature. Compounded oral
suspensions are stable for 60 days.
Small Animal Dosage
Dogs
· 2 mg/kg q24h PO initially then 0.5-1 mg/kg q48h. In dogs, doses as high as
1.5 mg/kg q48h PO have been used with prednisolone.
Cats (use cautiously)
· Cats are sensitive to bone marrow-suppressing effects, and many clinicians avoid
Azithromycin 65

Azithromycin
ay-zith-roe-my'sin
Trade and other names: Zithromax
Functional classification: Antibacterial
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Azalide antibiotic. Similar mechanism of action as macrolides (e.g., erythromycin),
   go   sis d  i   
activity is primarily gram-positive cocci, including streptococci and staphylococci.
It also has good activity against Mycopiasmn, Chlamydin, and some intracellular
pathogens. The activity against Toxoplasma has been questionable. Pharmacokinetic
data show extremely long plasma, tissue, and leukocyte half-lives in dogs, cats, and
horses. Plasma half-life is 18 hours in horses, 35 hours in cats, and 30 hours in
dogs. Volume of distribution also is large, with values exceeding 10 L/kg.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Azithromycin is indicated for treatment of bacterial infections. Antimicrobial
spectrum is primarily gram-positive. Azithromycin is not recommended for serious
gram-negative infections. It may be used to treat infections caused by Mycoplasma
and other atypical organisms. Azithromycin has been used to treat intracellular
Organisms because of its ability to concentrate in leukocytes. One of the uses has
been to treat infections caused by Rhodococcus equi in foals. However, in one
than azithromycin plus rifampin. In foals, azithromycin, administered at a dose of
10 mg/kg q48h oral, administered during the frst 2 weeks after birth, has been
used prophylactically to decrease Rbodococcus infection in foals at high risk (farms
with high endemic risk). In horses, azithromycin also has been used to treat
proliferative enteritis caused by Lawsonia intracellwiaris. Azithromycin has been used
in cats to treat upper respiratory infections. There are no controlled clinical trials to
document success for this use; however, this treatment has been common among
veterinarians. Azithromycin administered to cats with infections caused by
Chiamydophilia felis(formerly Chiamydia psittaci), at 10-15 mg/kg once daily for
3 days and thereafter two times per week, was not effective for eliminating the
organism, although clinical signs improved. However, azithromycin was not
effective in cats for treatment of Mycopiasma bemofelis (hemobartonellosis). When
azithromycin was administered to dogs with pyoderma at a dose of either l0 mg/kg
on day 1 followed by 5 mg/kg on days 2 through 5 or 5 mg/kg given 2 days per
twice daily. In dairy calves, azithromycin administration significantly suppressed
shedding of Cryptosporidiwm parvnm and improved clinical signs.
66   Azithromycin
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects to azithromycin have not been reported in publications. However,
vomiting is likely with high doses. Diarrhea may occur in some patients. Diarrhea
has been reported in horses that were administered recommended doses.
Contraindications and Precautions
Use cautiously in animals with a history of vomiting. Administration to adult
horses has been associated with diarrhea. Do not administer IV solution as a
bolus or IM.
Drug Interactions
Drug interactions have not been reported in animals. This class of drugs has the
potential to inhibit some cytochrome P450 enzymes that are involved in drug
metabolism, but azithromycin is less likely than erythromycin or clarithromycin
to interfere with cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Instructions for Use
Azithromycin may be better tolerated than erythromycin. A primary difference from
other antibiotics is the high intracellular concentrations achieved and long half-life
that allows for intermittent administration. Although azithromycin has been
commonly used for infections in dogs and cats, there is insufficient clinical tnial
evidence for many uses. To prepare IV solution, add 4.8 mL sterile water to each
500-mg vial and shake. Further dilute this solution with either 500 or 250 mL
diluent to a solution of l or 2 mg/mL. When administered IV, a 1-mg/mL
solution should be administered over a 3-hour peniod or 2 mg/ mL should be
administered over l hour.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Susceptibility testing: CLSI break point for sensitive organisms is ≤2 mcg/mL
Formulations
Azithromycin is available in 250-mg capsules, 250- and 600-mg tablets, 100- and
200-mg/5 mL oral suspension, and 500-mg vials for injection. Also, 1-g packets are

68Benazepril Hydrochloride
Benazepril Hydrochloride
ben-ay'zeh-pril hye-droe-klor'ide
Trade and other names: Lotensin (human preparation) and Fortekor,
 Benazecare (veterinary preparation)
Functional classification: Vasodilator, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
inhibitor
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
ACE inhibitor. Inhibits conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II
is a potent vasoconstrictor and will also stimulate sympathetic stimulation, renal
hypertension, and synthesis of aldosterone. The inhibition of aldosterone will decrease
sodium and water retention. Benazepril, like other ACE inhibitors, will produce
vasodilation and decrease aldosterone-induced congestion. ACE inhibitors also
contribute to vasodilation by increasing concentrations of some vasodilating kinins
and prostaglandins. Unlike enalapril, benazepril has a dual mode of elimination
through the kidneys and liver. Duration of ACE-inhibiting action is l6-24 hours,
despite a short plasma half-life, because of high-affinity binding to ACE.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Benazepril, like other ACE inhibitors, is used to treat hypertension and CHF.
Evidence shows that it may decrease the likelihood of developing cardiomyopathy in
some dogs, but other studies failed to show this benefit. For treatment of occult
mitral valve disease in dogs, there has not been a benefit of therapy. It may benefit
some cats in heart failure or with systemic hypertension; however, some cats with
hypertension may not respond, and ACE inhibitors are not considered a primary
treatment for hypertension in cats. Benazepril has limited antihypertensive effects
in cats with naturally occurring renal disease but may be effective in slowing the
progression of renal failure. In studies in which it has been used in cats with renal
insufficiency, it was associated with a small reduction in systemic hypertension,
 reduced glomerular fltration pressure, decreased glomerular hypertension,
reduction in urine protein loss, and an increase in glomerular filtration rate (GFR),
but no overall benefits on survival. In dogs it produces similar benefits to animals
with renal disease (decreased proteinuria, increased GFR, and lower blood pressure),
but it does not increase survival.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Benazepril has been well-tolerated in dogs and cats with chronic renal failure.
However, benazepril may cause azotemia in some patients; carefully monitor
renal parameters after initiation of treatment, particularly in patients receiving
high doses of diuretics.
Contraindications and Precautions
 Discontinue ACE inhibitors in pregnant animals. ACE inhibitors cross the
placenta and have caused fetal malformations and death of the fetus.
Drug Interactions
Use cautiously with other hypotensive drugs and diuretics. Nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may decrease vasodilating effects.
Betamethasone 69
Instructions for Use
Dose is based on approved use in dogs in Europe and Canada. Monitor renal

Bisoprolol fumarate
bis-oh'-proe-lol
Trade and other names: Zebeta
Functional classification: Antiarrhythmic, beta blocker
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Bisoprolol is a synthetic betaj-selective beta-adrenergic receptor blocker with a low
affinity for betaz-receptors in bronchial smooth muscle, blood vessels, and fat cells
and no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Typical cardioselective effects include
lower heart rate, decreased cardiac output, and inhibition of renin release by
kidneys. At higher doses it will lose betaj selectivity and also inhibit some beta2
receptors to affect bronchial and vascular smooth muscle. Clearance in dogs
is balanced (60% metabolized by the liver and 40% excreted unchanged),
distinguishing bisoprolol from lipophilic beta blockers such as carvedilol and
metoprolol and hydrophilic beta blockers like atenolol. In dogs, bisoprolol has high
and consistent oral absorption (9l%) and a half-life of 4 hours. Although bisoprolo)
prolongs survival in human patients with heart failure, similar studies have not been
conducted in dogs or cats.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Bisoprolol is a beta, blocker that is somewhat cardioselective and therefore is
indicated for conditions that require a reduction in heart rate, heart conductivity,
or contractility. Such conditions include tachyarrhythmias and atrial fbrillation.
In people it is used to treat hypertension, but this use has not been explored in
animals.
Bleomycin Sulfate75
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Beta blockade will result in adverse effects that are attributed to decreased
B
adrenergic tone in the heart. Bradycardia and heart block are possible. At high
doses, or in sensitive doses, bisoprolol may produce bronchospasm. Treat
bradycardia from overdose with atropine.
Contraindications and Precautions
Use cautiously in animals with airway disease, myocardial failure, and cardiac
conduction disturbances. Use cautiously in animals with low cardiac reserve.
Drug Interactions
Use cautiously with other drugs that may decrease cardiac contraction or heart rate.
Concurrent use of rifampin may increase the metabolic clearance of bisoprolol.
Instructions for Use
 Dosing precautions are similar to other beta-blocking drugs.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor heart rate and rhythm. Monitor blood pressure in patients prone to
hypotension.

Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Anabolic steroid. Boldenone is a steroid ester designed to maximize anabolic effects
while minimizing androgenic action (see also Methyltestosterone). Anabolic agents
Boldenone Undecylenate77
have been used for reversing catabolic conditions, increasing weight gain, increasing
muscling in animals, and stimulating erythropoiesis. Stanozolol is a similar drug used
in horses. There are no documented differences in effcacy among the anabolic
steroids.
B
Indications and Clinical Uses
 Boldenone is an anabolic agent. It is used primarily in horses to improve nitrogen
balance, reduce overexertion associated with exercise, and improve training. It may
also improve appetite and improve weight gain when used with a well-balanced diet.
Boldenone is a long-lasting agent, and effects may persist for 6 weeks after an
intramuscular injection.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects from anabolic steroids can be attributed to the androgenic
action of these steroids. Increased masculine effects are common. Increased
aggressiveness may be observed. Increased incidence of some tumors has
been reported in people and 17 alpha-methylated oral anabolic steroids
(oxymetholone, stanozolol, and oxandrolone) are associated with hepatic toxicity.

Bromide ordinarily is used in patients with seizure disorders that have been
refractory to phenobarbital. Usually, patients are treated with both phenobarbital
therapy for epilepsy. If bromide is added to phenobarbital therapy, it allows for a
reduction in phenobarbital dose (reduce by 25% every 6 weeks). Bromide has not
been as effective for treating cats with seizure disorders as in dogs. Cats have more
adverse effects and are less well controlled.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Common side effects include PU /PD, polyphagia, ataxia, sedation, and GI upset.
More serious adverse effects are related to high levels of bromide (bromism) and
are more specific for the CNS. Signs of toxicosis are CNS depression, delirium,
hyperexcitability, weakness, and ataxia. Hind limb stiffness and abnormal gait also
may be a sign of bromide toxicosis.
 Nausea and pancreatitis have been reported in dogs, and there is evidence that
Jo ysu au sseaul Aeu saop ul ieiqeqouyd pue apoiq jo uogeunqon e
pancreatitis.
 Some dogs show paradoxical excitement with bromide treatment. In many
cats, bronchitis, resembling allergic airway disease, has been observed. In cats this
may be characterized by coughing.
Contraindications and Precautions
Consider using sodium bromide, rather than potasium bromide, in patients
with hypoadrenocorticism or in any patients in which potassium regulation is a
problem. Likewise, consider the sodium content of administration in animals with
CHF or hypertension. Diets high in chloride will cause a shorter half-life and
need for a higher dose. Monitor plasma concentrations and adjust dose as
necessary whenever changing diets because increasing chloride in the diet will
shorten the half-life and vice versa. If diet is high in chloride (Hill's h/d, s/d,
I/d, and others), higher starting doses may be necessary. Administration of
bromide will interfere with some blood chemistry analysis (e.g., false elevation of
chloride).
Bromide 79
Drug Interactions
Diets high in chloride will cause a shorter half-life and need for a higher dose.
Administration of bromide will interfere with some blood chemistry analysis (e.g,
B
flse elevation of chlonde).
Instructions for Use
 Bromide usually is administered in combination with phenobarbital. Sodium
bromide can be substituted for potassium bromide. When considering doses for
sodium bromide, slight dose adjustments should be considered. Potassium bromide
is 67% bromide, and sodium bromide is 78% bromide. The dose of sodium bromide
should be approximately 15% less (e.g., 30 mg/kg of potassium bromide is
equivalent to 25 mg/kg of sodium bromide).
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor serum bromide concentrations to adjust dose. Effective plasma
concentrations should be 1-2 mg/mL (100-200 mg/dL), but if used alone
(without phenobarbital) higher concentrations of 2-2.5 mg/mL (200-250 mg/dL)
and as high as 4 mg/mL may be needed. Most veterinary laboratories can perform a
test for bromide in plasma or serum.
Formulations
Bromide is usually prepared as an oral solution. Although there are no commercial
forms approved by the FDA, compounding pharmacists can prepare a solution. To
prepare the oral solution, mix 25 g of potassium bromide with 60 mL of purified
water, then add a suffcient quantity of corn syrup to make l00 mL. This
formulation will result in a concentration of approximately 151-185 mg/mL. This

bromide with 60 mL purified water, then add a sufficient quantity of corn syrup to
make lo0 mL. This formulation will result in a concentration of approximately
151-185 mg/mL. This solution is stable for 180 days.
A pharmacist should prepare the intravenous solution in sterile water and filter it
to remove impurities. To prepare injectable solution, add 3.0 g of sodium bromide
with a suffcient quantity of sterile water to make l00 mL. This formulation will
result in a concentration of approximately 2l-25.6 mg/mL. It is stable for 180 days
and should be stored in the refrigerator to decrease the risk of microbial growth.

Trade and other names: Enterocort
Functional classification: Anti-inflammatory, corticosteroid
82 Budesonide
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Budesonide is a locally acting corticosteroid but is lo00 times more active than
prednisolone as a corticosteroid. It is approved for use in people, but there has
been only limited use in small animals. Budesonide granules are contained in an
ethylcellulose matrix that is coated with methacrylic acid polymer. This coating does
not release the drug until the pH is >5.5. Therefore, the drug is not usually released
until it reaches the distal GI tract. If any is absorbed, 80%-90% is inactivated
by metabolism first-pass effects. Therefore, systemic glucocorticoid effects are
minimized. In humans it has been as effective as other drugs for treatment of
Crohn's disease.
Indications and Clinical Uses
In animals it has been used to treat inflammatory bowel disease. The most common
use has been for treating colitis in dogs or inflammatory bowel disease in cats. There
is only limited experience with budesonide in dogs and cats, and reports of
successfil treatment are mostly anecdotal.

Bupivacaine Hydrochloride
byoo-piv'ah-kane hye-droe-kloride
Trade and other names: Marcaine and generic brands
Functional classification: Local anesthetic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Local anesthetic. Bupivacaine inhibits nerve conduction via sodium channel
blockade. Bupivacaine has a slow onset of action (20 minutes) but is longer
acting (6-8 hours) and more potent than lidocaine or other local anesthetics.
Epidural onset of action is approximately l5-20 minutes with a duration of
2-4 hours.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Bupivacaine is used for local anesthesia and epidural analgesia/anesthesia. It is
administered by local infltration or by epidural injection.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects are rare with local infiltration. High doses absorbed systemically
can cause nervous system signs (tremors and convulsions). The toxic dose in cats
is 5 mg/kg. In cats, signs of toxicity include bradycardia, arrhythmias, tremors,
muscle twitching, and seizures. After epidural administration, respiratory paralysis
is posible with high doses.
Contraindications and Precautions

Functional classification: Analgesic, opioid
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
dan-edde pue istuoe roidansi-n ieed e si sudouadng 'aissaieue pioido
antagonist. It is 25 to 50 times more potent than morphine. Buprenorphine may
have been variable, depending on the study. The half-life in dogs has ranged from
4.5 hours to 9 hours, with a clearance from 5.4 to 24 mL/kg/min. In horses the
half-life is 7 hours, with a clearance of 8 mL/kg/min. In horses the absorption from
IM administration is highly variable (4l%-93%).
Indications and Clinical Uses
Buprenorphine is an opiate analgesic that is used for pain control in dogs and cats. It
has lower efficacy (lower ceiling) than pure mu-receptor agonists such as morphine.
Buprenorphine has been shown to be effective in animal studies for treating
postoperative pain. Duration of analgesia based on plasma values in animals is 3-4
hours, but it may be longer clinically because of slow dissociation from binding sites
of effect has not been established for all indications in well-controlled studies and has
86Buprenorphine Hydrochloride
been variable. In cats it has been administered for transmucosal absorption (buccal
administration), in which high systemic absorption has been demonstrated. In dogs,
higher doses must be administered to achieve analgesic effects. In dogs, 120 mcg/kg
administered transmucosal (gingiva) is equivalent to 20 mcg/kg intravenously. At
these doses for dogs, the high volume increases the risk of drug loss from the mouth
or from swallowing. In horses, the doses that are analgesic are likely to produce
adverse effects (excitement and locomotor activity), which limits the uses in horses.
The adverse effects in horses persist longer than the analgesic effects.
In people, buprenorphine analgesia has been enhanced with the addition of small
doses of naloxone (0.00l-0.1 mcg/kg), but this effect has not been investigated in
animals.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects are similar to other opiate agonists, except there may be less
respiratory depression. Sedation is common. Dependency from chronic use of
80 mg/kg.
 In horses, restlessness, excitatory reactions, head shaking, pawing, shifting leg
movements, decreased intestinal motility, and increased locomotor activity are
likely and may persist for several hours.
Contraindications and Precautions
Patients receiving buprenorphine may require higher doses of naloxone for
reversal. IV dose in horses may cause behavior reactions (excitement, pacing).

Instructions for Use
Buprenorphine is used for analgesia, often in combination with other analgesics
or in conjunction with general anesthesia. It is longer acting than morphine and
only partially reversed by naloxone. When administration is intended to be buccal
pue eson [eio aun on patdde si asop ainua au ieun iueiodn st il (iesonsuen)
not swallowed. Ingested drug will not be effective (only 3%-6% oral absorption).
Therefore, as the dose increases, the volume also increases and there is a higher
likelihood that some of the drug will be lost from the mouth or swallowed (e.g., at
a dose of 0.03 mg/kg to cats, the volume necessary for administration is 0.45 mL
per average cat).
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor patient's heart rate and respiration. Although bradycardia rarely needs to be
treated when it is caused by an opioid, if necessary atropine can be administered. If
srious respiratory depression occurs, the opioid can be reversed with naloxone.
Patients receiving buprenorphine may require higher doses of naloxone for reversal.
Formulations
Buprenorphine is available in 0.3-mg/mL injection solution in a l-mL vial. Two-

byoo-tor'fah-nole tar'trate
Trade and other names: Torbutrol and Torbugesic
Functional classification: Analgesic, opioid
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Opioid analgesic. Opiate that acts as kappa receptor agonist and weak mu-receptor
antagonist (some authorities classify the antagonist effect as a “partial agonist"
effect). As a kappa-agonist, butorphanol produces sedation and analgesia in animals.
It is considered a mild analgesic compared to pure mu-receptor opiates. It is often
used in combination with other anesthetics. It has a short half-life in animals (l-2
hours) and a short duration of analgesia (l-2 hours).
90 Butorphanol Tartrate
Indications and Clinical Uses
Butorphanol is used for perioperative analgesia, for chronic pain, and as an
antitussive agent. Butorphanol is considered a weak analgesic compared to drugs
that are pure mu-receptor agonists and some of the observed effects may be caused
by sedation, rather than analgesia. In dogs, at doses of 0.4 mg/kg, butorphanol
 produces analgesia for a duration of l.0 hour or less. As an antitussive, it is more
potent than morphine (4x) and codeine (l00x). Duration of the antitussive effect is
approximately 90 minutes, but the effect may persist for as long as 4 hours. In cats,
butorphanol at 0.4 mg/kg may have an analgesic duration of effect for as long as 3
hours. In horses it may be administered IV, IM, and as constant rate infusion
(CRI). CRI has been shown effective in controlled studies
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects are similar to other opioid analgesic drugs. Sedation is common at
analgesic doses. Respiratory depression can occur with high doses. Lethal dose in
dogs (LDso) is 20 mg/kg. Although bradycardia rarely needs to be treated when
it is caused by an opioid, if necessary atropine can be administered. If serious
 e      sa se rs
has been observed in cats. Decreased intestinal peristalsis and constipation may
ed e iq a ao ls u ssi y 'sie sos u i
concern in some horses.
Contraindications and Precautions
Schedule IV controlled substance. Butorphanol use in birds requires much higher
 doses than in mammals because of shorter half-life and rapid clearance (e.g*-
2-4 mg/kg every 2-4 hours).
Drug Interactions
 Butorphanol is compatible with many other analgesics and used in combination
treatment for analgesia. Because butorphanol is an agonist/antagonist, it may
antagonize some effects of drugs that are pure agonists (e.g., fentanyl, morphine,
and oxymorphone). However, the clinical significance of this antagomism has
been debated among experts. Do not mix with sodium barbiturates.
Instructions for Use
Butorphanol is often used in combination with anesthetic agents or in conjunction
with other analgesic drugs. For most indications, a dose of 0.4 mg/kg is considered
optimum, and there is no reason to increase the dose above 0.8 mg/kg because this
is considered the ceiling dose. Butorphanol has a short duration of effect of less
than 2 hours and usually only l hour. In horses, because butorphanol may cause
increased locomotor activitiy and excitement, xylazine may be administered prior to
buprenorphine.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor patient's heart rate and respiration.

Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Vitamin D analogue, also called 1 ,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. Calcitriol is
nomally formed in the kidneys from 25-hydroxycholecalciferol. Action of calcitriol
is to increase calcium absorption from the intestine and facilitate a parathyroid
homone (PTH) effect on bone. Low calcitriol levels in animals lead to decreased
intestinal calcium absorption. Animals with chronic renal failure and
hyperparathyroidism offten have low calcitriol levels. Calcitriol can also inhibit
synthesis and storage of PTH.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Calcitriol is used to treat calcium deficiency and diseases such as hypocalcemia
associated with hyperparathyroidism. It is also used to increase calcium in cats that
have had parathyroid glands removed. In this use, it is often administered with
calcium supplements to the diet. It is used in dogs and cats to manage calcium and
phosphorous balance with chronic kidney disease. Although used by veterinarians to
reduce renal secondary PTH concentrations in animals with chronic renal disease.
this benefit is more controversial and not supported by strong evidence. Calcitriol
should not be used as a vitamin D supplement.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Overdose can result in hypercalcemia.
Contraindications and Precautions
 Do not use in patients that are at risk of hypercalcemia. Capsules made for
humans may contain high overdoses for dogs and cats and should be
refomulated.
Drug Interactions
Calcitriol may cause hypercalcemia if used with thiazide diuretics.
Instructions for Use
Doses should be adjusted in each patient according to response and monitoring
calcium plasma concentration. Dose requirements may vary depending on the
adjustment to calcium levels. For example, when used for treating dogs with chronic
kidney disease, the dose was 2.5 ng/kg/day but ranged from 0.75 to 5 ng/kg/day
based on adjustments from measuring calcium concentrations. When used in chronic
renal failure, it is often used with intestinal phosphate binders (e.g., aluminum
hydroxide) and dietary phosphorous restriction.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor plasma ionized calcium concentration. Adjust doses as necessary
to maintain normal calcium, phosphorous, and PTH concentrations.
Monitor serum PTH concentrations (assays are available in many diagnostic
Calcium Carbonate 93
laboratories). Monitor serum creatinine in animals when used to treat chronic kidney
disease.
Formulations
Calcitriol is available as injection (Calcijex) in a 1- and 2-mcg/mL and in 0.25- and
0.5-mcg capsules and l mcg/mL oral solution (Rocaltrol).

Calcium Carbonate
Trade and other names: Titralac, Calci-mix, Tums, and generic brands
Functional classification: Calcium supplement
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Calcium supplement. Calcium is essential for the functional integrity of several body
systems. Calcium carbonate is equivalent to 400 mg of calcium ion per gram.
Calcium carbonate neutralizes stomach acid for treating and preventing stomach
ulcers.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Calcium carbonate is used as an oral calcium supplement for hypocalcemia,
sometimes used with vitamin D supplements or calcitriol. It is used as antacid to
treat gastric hyperacidity and GI ulcers and as an intestinal phosphate binder for
hyperphosphatemia associated with renal failure.

cystic calculi. When calcium carbonate or calcium citrate are used as a phosphate
binder to prevent hyperphosphatemia, caution is advised to avoid hypercalcemia
in patients with renal failure.
Drug Interactions
 Oral administration of calcium supplements may interfere with absorption of other
dnugs such as fluoroquinolones (e.g., enrofloxacin, orbifloxacin, marbofloxacin),
bisphosphonates, zinc, iron, and tetracyclines. Use cautiously with thiazide
diuretics because this could cause a high increase in calcium concentrations.
Instructions for Use
Calcium carbonate is equivalent to 400 mg of calcium ion per gram. Doses are
primarily derived from extrapolation of human doses. When used as a calcium
supplement, doses should be adjusted according to serum calcium concentrations.

Captopril
kap'toe-pril
Trade and other names: Capoten
Functional classification: Vasodilator, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
inhibitor
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
ACE inhibitor. Captopril inhibits conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II,
leading to vasodilation. Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor and will stimulate
sympathetic stimulation, renal hypertension, and synthesis of aldosterone. ACE
inhibitors limit the ability of aldosterone to cause sodium and water retention
that contribute to congestion. Captopril, like other ACE inhibitors, will cause
100   Captopril
vasodilation, but ACE inhibitors also contribute to vasodilation by increasing
concentrations of some vasodilating kinins and prostaglandins.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Captopril, like other ACE inhibitors, is used to treat hypertension and CHF. It has
been used primarily in dogs, but its use has declined. Captopril is the frst ACE
inhibitor available for clinical use but has been replaced by other ACE inhibitors
such as enalapril, benazepril and lisinopril. Unlike benazepril and enalapril, it has not
been studied for clinical use in dogs and cats.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Hypotension is possible with excessive doses. Captopril may cause azotemia
in some patients, especially when administered with potent diuretics
(e.g., furosemide). GI side effects, predominantly anorexia, are common
in dogs.
Contraindications and Precautions
Discontinue ACE inhibitors in pregnant animals; they cross the placenta and have
caused fetal malformations and death of the fetus.
Drug Interactions
Use cautiously with diuretics and potassium supplements. Nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may diminish antihypertensive effect.
Instructions for Use
Use of captopril has been replaced by enalapril and benazepril in small animal
practices, and most clinical experts recommend these other drugs instead of
captopril.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor patients carefilly to avoid hypotension. With all ACE inhibitors, monitor
electrolytes and renal function 3-7 days after initiating therapy and periodically
thereafter.
Formulations
Captopril is available in 12.5-, 25-, 50-, and 100-mg tablets.
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container at room temperature. More stable at acidic pH.
Oral compounded solutions are stable for 30 days refigerated. However, tap water
should not be used; purified water is necessary to ensure stability.

Carbenicillin  l01
Carbenicillin
kar-ben-ih-sill'in
Trade and other names: Geopen and Pyopen Carbenicillin indanyl sodium
(Geocillin)
c
Functional classification: Antibacteria
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Beta-lactam antibiotic. Carbenicillin has an action similar to ampicillin, which inhibits
bacterial cell wall synthesis. Carbenicillin has a broad spectrum of activity that includes
both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. However, resistance is possible,
especially among beta-lactamase-positive strains. The difference between carbenicillin
and ampicillin is that it is active against Psendomonas aeruginosn and other gram-
negative bacteria that are resistant to ampicillin and amoxicillin. Half-life is short and
clearance is rapid in animals; therefore it requires frequent administration.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Carbenicilin is used to treat gram-negative infections in animals, including infections
caused by Psendomonas aeruginosn. The use of carbenicillin is uncommon in
veterinary medicine and has been replaced by other drugs such as ticarcillin and
and should not be used for systemic infections. However, this form may produce
high enough urine concentrations for treating some infections of lower urinary tract.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Carbenicillin, like other penicillin drugs, may cause allergy. Carbenicillin may
cause bleeding problems in some animals by interfering with platelets.
Contraindications and Precautions
Use cautiously in patients sensitive to penicillins (e.g., allergy).
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions are reported in animals. Do not mix in vial with other
drugs because inactivation may result.
Instructions for Use
Carbenicillin has a short half-life and should be administered frequently for optimum
bactericidal effect. Carbenicillin injection often is administered with an
aminoglycoside when treating Psendomonas infections. Do not mix with
aminoglycosides pnior to administration or inactivation will result. Carbenicillin
indanyl sodium is the oral formulation of carbenicillin but attains concentrations that
are only sufficient for treating UTIs. Do not use for systemic infections.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Culture and sensitivity testing recommended to guide therapy. CLSI break points
≤l6 mcg/mL for other gram-negative organisms.
Formulations
Carbenicillin has been unavailable because other drugs are used as a replacement.
However, older fomulations include l-, 2-, 5-, 10-, and 30-g vials for injection and
500-mg tablets.

Carbimazole
kar-bih'mah-zole
Trade and other names: Neomercazole, Vidalta
 Functional classification: Antithyroid drug
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antithyroid drug similar to methimazole. It is a pro-drug converted to methimazole
after administration. Like methimazole, the action is to serve as substrate for thyroid
peroxidase (TPO) and inhibits it and decreases incorporation of iodide into tyrosine
molecules. It also inhibits coupling of mono-iodinated and di-iodinated residues to
form T4 and T3. Carbimazole has been preferred in some patients because, compared
to methimazole, it may have fewer side effects, such as less frequent GI problems.
Oral absorption (based on methimazole concentrations) is 88% in cats.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Carbimazole has been more readily available in Europe, where there is more clinical
experience, than in the US. Experience in the US is limited because of lack of
 availability. Sustained-release formulation in Europe (Vidalta) administered to people
 as 15 mg once per day, followed by 10-25 mg once daily in people.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
In cats, lupus-like reactions are possible, such as vasculitis and bone marrow
changes. In people, it has caused agranulocytosis and leukopenia. Other systemic
effects reported for methimazole are expected to be similar for carbimazole (for
example, bone marrow effects).
Contraindications and Precautions
 Do not use in cats with bone marrow suppression or thrombocytopenia.
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions are reported in animals.
Carboplatin 103
Instructions for Use
Carbimazole is used in Europe; clinical experience in US is limited. Otherwise, the
clinical indications and use are similar as for methimazole.

Carboplatin
kar-boe-plat' in 
Trade and other names: Paraplatin
Functional classification: Anticancer agent
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Anticancer agent. Carboplatin is a second-generation platinum compound and is
non-cell cycle-dependent tumor cell lysis. Major route of elimination is via the
be as toxic.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Carboplatin has been used for squamous cell carcinoma and other carcinomas,
melanoma, osteosarcomas, and other sarcomas. When used in dogs,
myelosuppression has been the most dose-limiting factor. Compared to cisplatin,
carboplatin is better tolerated in cats and is preferred. However, bone marrow
suppression is the dose-limiting toxicity in cats.
104  Carboplatin
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Compared to cisplatin, carboplatin is less emetogenic and less nephrotoxic.
In dogs, the other most common adverse effects relate to GI system toxicity
(gastroenteritis, vomiting, anorexia, and diarrhea). The dose limiting effect is
myelosuppression, anemia, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia. In dogs, nadir of
myelosuppresson occurs at 14 days, but recovery occurs by 2l-28 days. In cats,
the nadir is 2l days and recovery occurs by 28 days. Vomiting is not as much of
a problem as for cisplatin, but GI toxicosis is still a problem, especially in smaller
dogs. Because it is excreted by the kidneys, animals with decreased renal function
may have a higher rate of GI toxicosis.
Contraindications and Precautions
 In one study, small dogs were more prone than larger dogs to adverse effects.
Drug Interactions
Do not use with other nephrotoxic drugs.
Instructions for Use
Available for reconstitution for injection. It is stable for l month when reconstituted
with 5% dextrose. It may be frozen at -4°C to prolong the stability of a
 reconstituted vial. Do not use with administration sets containing aluminum because
of incompatibility. It is usually administered in specific anticancer protocols; consult
oncology protocols for regimen. In dogs, it has been dosed on a milligram per
square meter dose, which has produced a higher incidence of adverse effects in
smaller dogs compared to larger dogs; however, smaller dogs also were more likely
to respond. Carboplatin is excreted by the kidneys; therefore, the dose should be
decreased in proportion to reduced GFR and creatinine clearance.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitoring of CBC and platelets is recommended during treatment.
Formulations
Carboplatin is available in 50- and 150-mg vials for injection.
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature.
Stable for l month if reconstituted with 5% dextrose solution. It is stable if frozen at
4°C.
Small Animal Dosage

Carprofen  l105
Regulatory Information
Withdrawal times are not established for animals that produce food. This drug
should not be used in animals intended for food because it is an anticancer agent.
Carprofen
car-proe'fen
Trade and other names: Rimadyl, Vetprofen, Zinecarp (Europe), and generic
brands
Functional classification: NSAID
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Carprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Like other drugs in
this class, carprofen has analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the
synthesis of prostaglandins. The enzyme inhibited by an NSAID is the cyclo-
oxygenase enzyme (COX). The COX enzyme exists in two isoforms: COX-1 and
COX-2. COX-1 is primarily responsible for synthesis of prostaglandins important for
maintaining a healthy GI tract, renal function, platelet function, and other normal
functions. COX-2 is induced and responsible for synthesizing prostaglandins that
are important mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever. (There may be crossover
of COX-1 and COX-2 effects in some situations.) Carprofen is relatively COX-1
sparing compared to older NSAIDs, but it is not known if the specificity for COX-1
or COX-2 determines efficacy or safety. In horses, carprofen is not as COX-2
selective as it is in dogs. As an analgesic agent the mechanism of action may involve
other mechanisms other than inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Carprofen is used primarily for treatment of musculoskeletal pain and acute pain
related to surgery or trauma. It is used primarily for treatment of dogs. Long-term
safe use in cats has not been established. However, it is registered in Europe for
one-time administration in cats at 4 mg/kg injection. Although use in large animals
is uncommon, in cattle, carprofen has been shown to reduce inflammation in cows
associated with Escherichia coli mastitis at a dose of 0.7 mg/kg IV. Although
carprofen has been used in horses, it does not show the same COX-2 selectivity of
fever associated with mastitis and used to reduce inflammation associated with
bovine respiratory disease.
Precautionary Tnformation
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Safety of carprofen in dogs was determined by the sponsor during preclinical
studies. The most common adverse effect in dogs has been in the GI tract
(vomiting, anorexia, and diarrhea). GI ulcers, perforation, and bleeding are
e   s  s   s  
hepatic toxicity in dogs. Signs of toxicity usually appear 2-3 weeks after exposure.
There were no adverse effects on kidneys when carprofen was evaluated in
anesthetized dogs. Carprofen may lower total thyroid (T4) concentrations in
106  Carprofen
dogs but not free T4. Carprofen has produced toxicity in cats if administered at
the same dose rates as for dogs.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not use in cats at doses intended for dogs. Do not administer to animals
prone to GI ulcers. Do not administer with ulcerogenic drugs such as
corticosteroids. If a patient has had previous adverse effects from NSAIDs,
carprofen should be used cautiously.
Drug Interactions
Use NSAIDs cautiously with other drugs known to cause GI injury (e.g.,
corticosteroids). The efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors
and diuretics (e.g., furosemide) may be diminished when administered
concurrently with NSAIDs.
Instructions for Use
Doses are based on clinical investigations in dogs with arthritis and for treatment of
pain associated with surgery. Dogs may receive carprofen either once daily or twice
daily with similar effectiveness. The only approved dose for cats is 4 mg/kg as a
extrapolations suggest a long-term dose of 0.5 mg/kg q24h PO. Long-term safety
at this dose has not been established.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
After administration has begun, one should monitor hepatic enzymes for evidence of
If liver enzymes are elevated, discontinue the medication and contact the drug
manufacturer.
Formulations
Carprofen is available in 25-, 75-, and 100-mg caplets; 25-, 75- and 100-mg
chewable tablets; and injectable solution: 50 mg/mL.
(Zinecarp injection has also been available in Europe.)
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature.
Carprofen has been compounded by mixing tablets with methylcellulose gel (1%),

Carvedilol
kar-ved' ih-lole
Trade and other names: Coreg
Functional classification: Antiarrhythmic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antiarrhythmic. Nonselective beta-receptor blocker. Carvedilol is a third-generation
adrenergic blocker. Carvedilol blocks both betaj-receptors and beta2-receptors in
heart and other tissues. Carvedilol is unique because it also has alpha-receptor-
blocking properties that will produce vasodilation. It also is reported to have
antioxidant properties.
In dogs the half-life is short (1.2 hrs). Oral absorption is low and variable
because of high systemic clearance and first-pass effects. Average oral absorption in
one study was only 14% and highly vaniable, but in another study it was only 1.6%
(range 0.4%-54%), making the oral use of carvedilol in dogs unpredictable. In
u yin siuaned uy un eaians sunod on umous ose uaaq su i adoad
failure, but this effect has not been measured in animals.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Carvedilol has been used to treat arrhythmias in animals. It is also used to treat
systemic hypertension and to block beta-cardiac receptors in animals with rapid heart
rates. Effcacy has been based on anecdotal accounts, extrapolation from humans, and
limited studies in healthy dogs. In healthy dogs, 0.2 mg/kg PO decreased heart rate
and 0.4 mg/kg PO decreased heart rate and lowered blood pressure. At 0.4 mg/kg,
the effects in healthy dogs persisted for 36 hours. In other studies, doses of 0.3 mg/
kg were not effective. In clinical patients, the optimum dose is not known and

Elimination is rapid after oral administration to dogs, but clinical pharmacodynamic
effects may persist for up to l2 hours, possibly from the metabolites.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Bradycardia can occur resulting from beta-receptor blockade. Carvedilol increases
risk of myocardial depression and decreased cardiac output. Adverse effects from
nonselective beta-receptor blockade are possible in other tissues.

Contraindications and Precautions
Use carefully in patients with limited cardiac reserve. Do not administer to
dehydrated or hypotensive animals. Use carefully in patients with respiratory
disease because the betaz-blocking properties can worsen bronchoconstriction.
Drug Interactions
Use with other beta blockers will increase its effect. Do not administer with other
drugs that may cause hypotension.
Instructions for Use
Doses in dogs established through clinical experience and limited trials. In a dose
titration study in dogs, the effective dose was 0.2-0.4 mg/kg q24h, PO.

1l4 Cefazolin Sodium
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Cephalosporin antibiotic. Action is similar to other beta-lactam antibiotics, which
inhibits synthesis of bacterial cell wall leading to cell death. Cephalosporins are
divided into first-, second-, third-, and fourth-generation drugs depending on
spectrum of activity. Cefazolin is a first-generation cephalosporin. Like other
first-generation cephalosporins, it is active against Streptococcns and Staphylococcus
pecies and some gram-negative bacilli, such as Pasteurelln, Escherichin coli,
and Klebsiella pnenmonine. The difference between cefazolin and other first-
generation cephalosporins is that it is slightly more active against gram-negative
Enterobacteriacene and its spectrum resembles some second-generation drugs.
Nevertheless, resistance is common among gram-negative bacteria. It is not active
against Psendomonas neruginosn. Methicillin-resistant Stapbylococcns aurens and other
staphylococci resistant to oxacillin will be resistant to first-generation cephalosporins.
In dogs the half-life, clearance, and volume of distribution (V) are 1.04 hours,
2.9 mL/kg/min, and 0.27 L/kg, respectively. These values in horses are 0.62
hours, 5.07 mL/kg/min, and 0.27 L/kg, respectively.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Cefazolin, because it is injectable, is the most common drug to be administered
prophylactically prior to surgery. It is one of the most frequently injected
cephalosporin antibiotics used in small animals. Like other frst-generation
cephalosporins, it is indicated for treating common infections in animals, including
UTIs, soft tissue infections, pyoderma and other dermal infections, and pneumonia.
Efficacy against infections caused by anaerobic bacteria is unpredictable.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects

Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
All cephalosporins are generally safe; however, sensitivity can occur in individuals
(allergy). Rare bleeding disorders have been known to occur with some
cephalosporins.
Contraindications and Precautions
 Do not use in animals with allergic sensitivity to other beta-lactams, especially
other cephalosporins. However, the incidence of cross sensitivity between
penicillins and cephalosporins is small (<l0% in people). Some cephalosporins
should not be used in animals with bleeding problems or that are receiving
warfarin anticoagulants. These cephalosporins are those that have an
N-methylthiotetrazole (NMTT) side chain and include cefotetan, cefamandole,
and cefoperazone.
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions are reported in animals. However, do not mix in a vial or
syringe with other drugs because inactivation may result.

cefovecin in dogs and cats; the use in other species, such as horses, large animals,
birds, and reptiles, is not recommended until specific dosing recommendations are
published.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
The animal safety studies have produced few serious adverse reactions. In dogs
and cats, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed in a dose-related manner.
With approved doses, mild GI upset may be observed for 2-3 days. Injection-site
irnitation and transient edema occurred with increasing frequency in a dose-
related manner and with repeat injections. The long half-life indicates that drug
concentrations will persist in animals for at least 60 days after an injection, but at
this time, this has not produced adverse reactions attributed to a long persistence
of drug in tissues.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not use in animals with allergic sensitivity to other beta-lactams, especially
other cephalosporins. However, the incidence of cross sensitivity between
penicillins and cephalosporins is small.

Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
C
All cephalosporins are generally safe; however, sensitivity can occur in individuals
(allergy). Rare bleeding disorders have been known to occur with some
cephalosporins. Vomiting and diarrhea can occur from oral administration of
cephalosporins.
Contraindications and Precautions
This drug is best taken with food to improve oral absorption. Do not use in
animals with allergic sensitivity to other beta-lactams, especially other
cephalosporins. However, the incidence of cross sensitivity between penicillins
and cephalosporins is small (<lo% in people). Some cephalosporins should
not be used in animals with bleeding problems or that are receiving
N-methylthiotetrazole (NMTT) side chain and include cefotetan, cefamandole,
and cefoperazone.
Drug Interactions
There are no important drug interactions reported for animals, but oral
absorption of cefpodoxime in people is inhibited by H blockers (e.g., cimetidine
and ranitidine) and antacids, which can decrease oral absorption by 30%.
Cephalosporins may be administered with other antibiotics to increase the
spectrum of activity and produce a synergistic effect. However, do not mix with
other drugs in a compounded formulation because inactivation may result.
Instructions for Use

Ceftiofur Crystalline Free Acid
sef " tee-oh-fer
Trade and other names: Excede, Naxcel XT
Functional classification: Antibacterial
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Cephalosporin antibiotic. Ceftiofur hydrochloride and ceftiofur sodium have similar
action and spectrum. Action is similar to other beta-lactam antibiotics, which inhibit
synthesis of bacterial cell wall leading to cell death. Cephalosporins are divided into
first-, second-, third-, and fourth-generation dnugs depending on spectrum of activity.
Ceftiofur most closely resembles the activity of a third-generation cephalosporin. It has
good activity against most gram-negative bacilli, especially Enterobacteriaceae. It has
potent activity against bovine and swine respiratory pathogens such as Mannbeimin,
Actinobacilluspleuropnenmoniae,Pastenrella mnltocida,Salmonella choleraesnis,
Haemophilus, and Streptococcus. Ceftiofur has activity against some gram-positive cocci,
such as streptococci, but activity against Staphylococcwsis not as high as other
cephalosporins. Ceftiofur is rapidly metabolized after administration to metabolites
such as desfuroylceftiofur, which is active against bacteria, except that it is less active
against Staphylococcns than other cephalosporins and the parent drug ceftiofur.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Ceftioifur crystalline free acid is indicated for treatment of swine respiratory disease
(SRD) caused by A.plenropnenmonine, P.mnitocida, S.choleraesnis, Haemophilns
paraswis, and Streptococcns snis. In cattle, it is used for treatment of bovine

However, there are specific products designed for intramammary use (Spectramast).
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
All cephalosporins are generally safe; however, sensitivity can occur in individuals
(allergy). Rare bleeding disorders have been known to occur with some
cephalosporins. For ceftiofur, doses that have exceeded the approved
label recommendations have caused bone marrow suppression in dogs.
Thrombocytopenia and anemia occurred at doses of 6.6 mg/kg and ll mg/kg
when administered to dogs. High doses have caused diarhea in horses. Injections
of the crystalline free acid formulation to small animals has caused injection site
lesions in some animals and is generally not recommended.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not administer this formulation (suspension) IV. Do not administer to
animals prone to sensitivity to beta-lactams. Do not administer to animals at high
doses. Ceftiofur crystalline free acid should not be used interchangeably with
ceftiofur sodium or ceftiofur hydrochlonide without consulting label information
for difference in dosing and withdrawal times.
Drug Interactions
 No drug interactions are reported in animals. However, do not mix in a vial or
 syringe with other drugs because inactivation may result.

frst-, second-, third-, and fourth-generation drugs depending on spectrum of activity.
Ceftiofur most closely resembles the activity of a third-generation cephalosporin.
 Ceftiofur has good activity against most gram-negative bacilli, especially
Enterobacteriacene. It has potent activity against bovine respiratory pathogens such as
Pastenrella mnltocida,Mannheimia haemolyticn,and Histophiinssomni(formerly
Haewophies somnus). Ceftiofur has activity against some gram-positive cocci, such as
streptococci, but activity against Staphrylococcusis not as high as other cephalosporins.
Ceftiofur is rapidly metabolized after administration to metabolites such as
desfuroylceftiofur, which is active against bacteria, except that it is less active against
Staphylococcwsthan other cephalosporins and the parent drug ceftiofur.
Indications and Clinical Uses
 Ceftiofur hydrochlonide is used in cattle and pigs for treatment and control of
respiratory disease in cattle caused by Mannbeimin, P. mnitocida, and H. somni
(formerly H. somnns). It is used for interdigital necrobacillosis (foot rot) in cattle
caused by Fusobncterinm necrophornm or Bacteroidesmeianinogenicus.Ceftiofur
hydrochloride has been shown to be effective for treatment of acute postpartum
metritis in dairy cows when administered at 2.2 mg/kg or for treatment of retained
fetal membranes by instilling into the uterus (l g). Cefiofur hydrochloride is used
for treatment of swine respiratory disease (SRD) caused by Aetinobacillus, P.
multocida,Salmonella choleraesnis,and Streptococcns snis.Ceftiofur hydrochloride and

(Spectramast DC). Although ceftiofur sodium has been used in horses and dogs to
treat infections, there is little experience with administration of ceftiofur
hydrochloride in these species.

Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
All cephalosporins are generally safe; however, sensitivity can occur in individuals
(allergy). Rare bleeding disorders have been known to occur with some
cephalosporins. For ceftiofur, doses that have exceeded the approved
Thrombocytopenia and anemia occurred at doses of 6.6 mg/kg and 1l mg/kg
when administered to dogs. High doses have caused diarrhea in horses.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not administer to animals prone to sensitivity to beta-lactams. Do not
administer to animals at high doses. Ceftiofur hydrochloride is a sterile suspension
and should not be used interchangeably with cefiofur sodium, which is a solution.
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions are reported in animals. However, do not mix in a vial or
syringe with other drugs because inactivation may result.
Instructions for Use
Dosing information is not available for species other than pigs and cattle. Dose in
cattle may be extended beyond 3 days if necessary. Alternatively, doses have been
administered to cattle for bovine respiratory disease (BRD) at 2.2 mg/kg at 48-hour
intervals. Ceftiofur sodium has been used in horses and dogs, but there is no
information available on the use of ceftiofur hydrochloride in these species.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor CBC if high doses are administered for long periods. Susceptibility
testing: CLSI guidelines for susceptible bacteria indicate that susceptible bactenia
have minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ≤2 mcg/mL. (Note that for
some human-labeled cephalosporins, the MIC values for susceptibility may be
≤8.0 mcg/mL.)

Ceftiofur Sodium
Sef' tee-oh-fer soe' dee-um
Trade and other names: Naxcel
Functional classification: Antibacteria
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Cephalosporin antibiotic. Cefiofur hydrochlonide and ceftiofur sodium have similar
synthesis of bactenial cell wall leading to cell death. Cephalosponins are divided
into frst-, second-, third-, and fourth-generation drugs depending on spectrum
of activity. Ceftiofur most closely resembles the activity of a third-generation
especially Enterobacteriaceae. It has potent activity against bovine and swine
respiratory pathogens such as Mannheimin, Actinobacillns plenropnenmoniae,
Pastewrella mnltocida,Saimonella choleraesuis,Haemophiius,and Streptococcus.
Ceftiofur has activity against some gram-positive cocci, such as streptococci, but
activity against Staphylococcusis not as high as other cephalosporins. Ceftiofur is
rapidly metabolized after administration to metabolites such as desfuroylceftiofur,
which is active against bacteria, except that it is less active against Stapiylococcws than
other cephalosporins and the parent drug ceftiofur.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Ceftiofur sodium is used in cattle and pigs for treatment and control of infections
caused by susceptible pathogens. It is registered for treatment of respiratory disease
and interdigital necrobacillosis (foot rot) in lactating cows in many countries.
Ceftiofur has been used for treatment of salmonella in calves. At 5 mg/kg q24h IM,
it decreased diarrhea and temperature but did not eradicate organism. Cefiofur
sodium has been administered intramammary for treatment of coliform mastitis,
but this is an extralabel use. Ceftiofur sodium is used in horses for treatment of
treating other infections such as those caused by gram-negative bacilli, including
Escherichin coli, Klebsiella pnewmonine, and salmonella. Higher doses should be used
for nonstreptococcal bacteria in horses. Ceffiofur sodium is registered for a daily
subcutaneous injection for treatment of UTIs in dogs, but it has not been evaluated
for treatment of other infections.

Cephalexin
sef-ah-lex 'in
Trade and other names: Keflex and generic brands
Functional classification: Antibacterial
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Cephalosporin antibiotic. Action is similar to other beta-lactam antibiotics, which
inhibits synthesis of bacterial cell wall leading to cell death. Cephalosporins are
divided into first-, second-, third-, and fourth-generation drugs depending
on spectrum of activity. Cephalexin is a first-generation cephalosporin.
 Like other frst-generation cephalosporins, it is active against Streptococcus and
Staphylococcus species and some gram-negative bacilli, such as Pastenrella, Escherichin
coli, and Klebsiella pnewmonine. However, resistance is common among gram-
negative bacteria. It is not active against Psendomonas aeruginosa. Staphylococcns
sPP. resistant to methicillin and oxacillin will be resistant to first-generation
cephalosporins.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Like other frst-generation cephalosporins, cephalexin is indicated for treating
common infections in animals, including UTIs, soft tissue infections, pyoderma and
other dermal infections, and pneumonia. Although not approved in the US for
animals, at this time it is registered in other countries, and there are published
efficacy studies documenting its effectiveness. Effcacy against infections caused by
anaerobic bacteria is unpredictable. In horses, half-life is short at only l.6 hours and
oral absorption is only 5%. In dogs, the oral absorption has ranged from 57% to
90%, depending on the study. In dogs the half-life, oral clearance, volume of
distribution (V/F), and peak concentration (Cmax) are 2.74 hours, 3.14 mL/kg/
min, 0.92 L/kg, and 19.5 mcg/mL, respectively.

Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antihistamine (H,-blocker). Cetirizine is the active metabolite of hydroxyzine.
Almost all hydroxyzine in dogs is converted to cetinizine. Cetinizine is similar to
other antihistamines—it acts by blocking the histamine type-1 (H,) receptor and
used to control pruritus and skin inflammation, rhinorrhea, and airway inflammation.
other, older antihistamines. The most important difference between cetirizine and
older drugs is that it does not cross the blood-brain barnier as readily and produces
less sedation. In cats, studies have shown cetirizine to be well absorbed after oral
administration with a half-life of l0 hours. In dogs the half-life is approximately
10-1l hours, and in horses it is 5.8 hours. A related drug is levocetinizine (Xyzal),
which is the active enantiomer of cetirizine and has two-fold higher activity
compared to cetinizine.
Indications and Clinical Uses

Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Sedation is not as likely as with other antihistamines. However, with higher doses
sedation is still possible. Antimuscarinic effects (atropine-like effects) also are
possible, but cetinizine may produce fewer antimuscarinic effects than other
antihistamines.
Contraindications and Precautions
Because antimuscarinic effects (atropine-like effects) are possible, do not use in
conditions for which anticholinergic drugs may be contraindicated, such as
glaucoma, ileus, or cardiac arrhythmias.

142   Chlorambucil
Drug Interactions
Charcoal will adsorb most other drugs administered orally to prevent their
absorption.
Instructions for Use
Dosing of activated charcoal has used a ratio of l0/l (charcoal/toxin) to administer
for treatment of intoxication. However, more recent evidence indicates that a ratio
>40/l is more appropriate, which may require higher doses than previously
thought. Activated charcoal is effective to treat intoxication if administered up to
4 hours after exposure, but after 4 hours, benefits decrease. Charcoal is available in
a variety of forms and usually is used as treatment for poisoning. Many commercial
preparations contain sorbitol, which acts as a flavoring agent and promotes intestinal
catharsis.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
When used as treatment for intoxication, careful monitoring of effects of toxin is
necessary because charcoal will not adsorb all of the toxicant.
Formulations
Charcoal is available in oral suspension and granules. Strengths of formulations vary
from 15 g/72 mL to 50/240 mL. Many formulations contain sorbitol, which is a
sweetener and also can produce an intestinal cathardic effect.
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container at room temperature. Do not mix with other
compounds because it will adsorb other chemicals.

one of the slowest-acting of the class of nitrogen mustards.
Chlorambucil    143
Indications and Clinical Uses
Chlorambucil is used for treatment of various tumors and immunosuppressive
therapy. Although little has been published on the clinical use of chlorambucil, it
may be effective in dogs and cats for immune-mediated disease. However, direct
most frequent uses has been for treatment of immune-mediated skin diseases of cats,
for which it has been used to treat cats with pemphigus and eosinophilic granuloma

Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature.
Chlorambucil undergoes rapid hydrolysis (within l0 minutes) in the presence of
water. Hydrolysis occurs most readily at pH >2. Therefore, chlorambucil can
decompose rapidly in compounded aqueous fomulations, such as those that contain
simple syrup and other excipients. Hydrolysis is slower if mixed in alcohol-based
solutions. If mixed with alcohol and stored in the freezer, it is stable for 3l days.

Chlorothiazide
klor-oh-thye'ah-zide
Trade and other names: Diuril
Functional classification: Diuretic
146  Chlorothiazide
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Thiazide diuretic. The thiazide diuretics are used infrequently in veterinary medicine.
They include hydrochlorothiazide and chlorothiazide. These drugs are sulfonamide
analogs and share similar chemical properties, but the pharmacokinetics have not
been very well described in animals. The action of thiazides is to inhibit the
Na/Cl cotransporter in the luminal side of the distal tubule. By inhibiting the
cotransporter, Nat and Cl reabsorption is blocked, leading to sodium and water
duresis. Because the action occurs in the distal tubule, these drugs have less of a
diuretic effect (less efficacy) than the loop diuretics.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Chlorothiazide use is not common in animals. In people it is used primarily to treat
hypertension. In animals it has been used to treat hypercalciuria (increased calcium
in the urine that may lead to urinary calculi).
Chlorothiazide inhibits sodium reabsorption in distal renal tubules to produce a
more dilute urine.
 Because it decreases renal excretion of calcium, it also has been used to prevent
woliths containing calcium. Dosage regimens used are derived either empirically or
from extrapolation of the human dose.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Chlorothiazide may cause electrolyte imbalance such as hypokalemia.
Contraindications and Precautions
 These drugs enhance calcium absorption by decreasing incracellular sodium and
enhance the Nat/Cat exchange and decreasing Cat+ excretion in urine. They
should never be used in hypercalcemia.
Drug Interactions
Avoid administering calcium and vitamin D supplements.
Instructions for Use
Not as effective as high-ceiling diuretics (e.g., furosemide) for producing a diuresis.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Electrolytes should be monitored during chronic therapy.
Formulations
Chlorothiazide is available in 250- and 500-mg tablets, 50-mg/mL oral suspension,
and injection vials of 500 mg (with mannitol).

Chlorpheniramine Maleate
klor-fen-eer'ah-meen mal'ee-ate
Trade and other names: Chlortrimeton and Phenetron
Functional classification: Antihistamine
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antihistamine (H-blocker). Similar to other antihistamines, it acts by blocking
the H receptor and suppresses inflammatory reactions caused by histamine. The
H,-blockers have been used to control pruritus and skin inflammation in dogs and
cats. Other commonly used antihistamines include clemastine, chlorpheniramine,
diphenhydramine, cetinizine, and hydroxyzine.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Chlorpheniramine is used to prevent allergic reactions and for pruritus therapy in
dogs and cats. However, success rates for treatment of pruritus have not been high.
In addition to the antihistamine effect for treating allergies, these drugs block the
that control vomiting in animals. Use in animals has been primarily derived from
empirical use. There is a lack of well-controlled clinical studies or efficacy trials to
document clinical effectiveness.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Sedation is the most common side effect. Sedation is the result of inhibition of
histamine N-methyltransferase. Sedation may also be attributed to block of other
CNS receptors such as those for serotonin, acetylcholine, and alpha-receptors.
Antimuscarinic effects (atropine-like effects) also are common, such as dry mouth
and decreased GI secretions.
Contraindications and Precautions
Antimuscarinic effects (atropine-like effects) are common. Do not use in
conditions for which anticholinergic drugs may be contraindicated, such as
glaucoma, ileus, or cardiac arrhythmias.

controlled clinical studies or efficacy trials to document clinical effectiveness.
Chlorpromazine is most often used as a centrally acting antiemetic for disorders
that produce vomiting via a central-acting mechanism. It is also used for sedation
and preanesthetic purposes, although acepromazine has been much more
commonly used.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Causes sedation. Like acepromazine, it also may cause alpha-adrenergic blockade
and vasodilation, but this effect has not been as well documented as for
acepromizine. It may produce anticholinergic effects in some animals. Although
phenothiazines are reported to decrease the threshold for producing seizures in
Chlorpromazine  149
some animals, this has not been shown in retrospective studies with acepromazine
in animals and has not been reported specifically for chlorpromazine. Like other
phenothiazines, it may produce extrapyramidal side effects (involuntary muscle
movement) in some individuals. In horses it has produced undesirable side
effects, including violent reactions.
c
Contraindications and Precautions
Use with caution in animals with seizure disorders and animals prone to
hypotension. Avoid use in horses.
Drug Interactions
It will potentiate effects from other sedatives.
Instructions for Use
Chlorpromazine is used for vomiting caused by toxins, drugs, or GI disease. Higher
doses than listed in dose section have been used with cancer chemotherapy (2 mg/
kg q3h SQ).
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
No specific monitoring is necessary.
Formulations
Chlorpromazine is available in a 25-mg/mL injection solution.
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature.

150  Chlortetracycline
Chlortetracycline
klor-tet' rah-sye-kleen
Trade and other names: Anaplasmosis block, Aureomycin soluble powder,
Aureomycin tablets, Aureomycin soluble calf tablets, Calf Scour Bolus, Femycin,
and generic brands
Functional classification: Antibacteria
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Tetracycline antibacterial drug. Inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by interfering with
peptide elongation by ribosome. Chlortetracycline is a bacteriostatic agent with a
broad spectrum of activity, which includes gram-positive bacteria and mycoplasma.
Most gram-negative bacilli, particularly enteric bacteria (e.g., E. coli) of the
Enterobacteriaceae will be resistant.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Broad-spectrum activity. It is used for routine infections and intracellular pathogens.
However, chlortetracycline is poorly absorbed orally and other tetracyclines are
preferred for systemic treatment of infections. The most common use for
chlortetracycline is as a feed additive to control respiratory and enteric infections in
hvestock. The clinical use in small animals and horses is rare.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
doses have caused renal injury. Oral administration to horses may produce diarrhea.
Contraindications and Precautions
Avoid use in young animals, except where permitted by label for young pigs or
cattle.
Drug Interactions
Chlortetracycline, like other tetracyclines, will bind to other cations orally
administered, which will prevent its absorption. Oral absorption will be decreased if
it is administered with products with calcium, zinc, aluminum, magnesium, or iron.
Instructions for Use
Chlortetracycline is not administered for systemic use in small animals. Doxycycline
has replaced most other tetracyclines for treatment in small animals. Most
chlortetracycline used is in powdered form and added to feed or drinking water of
lvestock.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Susceptibility testing: CLSI break point for susceptible organisms is ≤2 mcg/mL for
streptococci and <4 for other organisms. Tetracycline is used as a marker to test
susceptibility for other drugs in this class such as doxycycline, minocycline, and
oxytetracycline.
Formulations
Chlortetracycline is available as a powdered feed additive in 25 g/lb or 64 g/lb. It
is also available as an anaplasmosis block in 2.5 g/lb and in 25- and 500-mg tablets.

Chondroitin Sulfate
kon-droy'ten sul'fate
Trade and other names: Cosequin and Glycoflex
Functional classification: Nutritional supplement
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
manufacturer, and supported by some experimental evidence, chondroitin sulfate
provides precursors to stimulate synthesis of articular cartilage and inhibits
degradation and improves healing of articular cartilage.
Pharmacokinetic studies have produced conflicting results depending on
formulation, species studied, and assay technique. Although some studies have
demonstrated adequate oral absorption, there may be limited oral absorption of the
intact large molecule. In dogs, oral absorption has been as low as 5%, but in horses
absorption as high as 22% or 32% has been reported.
It is usually administered in combination with glucosamine. See Glucosamine
section for firther details.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Chondroitin sulfate is used primarily for treatment of degenerative joint disease and
is usually found in fomulations in combination with glucosamine. (See Glucosamine
152 Chondroitin Sulfate
for additional details.) Analyses of published clinical studies in dogs have concluded
that there is a moderate level of evidence to indicate some benefit in osteoarthritis,
but results may be inconsistent among studies. Benefits of treatment in horses with
glucosamine supplements.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects have not been reported, although hypersensitivity is posible.
Chondroitin is most often administered with glucosamine. See glucosamine for
potential adverse effects.
Contraindications and Precautions
No contraindications have been reported.
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions are reported in animals.
Instructions for Use
Doses are based primarily on empinicism and manufacturer's recommendations. There
are limited published trials of efficacy or dose titrations available to determine optimal
 dose. Doses listed are general recommendations and products available may vary.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
No specific monitoring is necessary.
Formulations
Because several chondroitin sulfate formulations are available, veterinarians are
encouraged to carefilly examine product label to ensure proper strength. Veterinary
dietary supplements can be highly variable in quality. One product (Cosequin)
is available in regular-strength (RS) and double-strength (DS) capsules. RS

C
Cimetidine Hydrochloride
sye-met'ih-deen hye-droe-klor'ide
Trade and other names: Tagamet (OTC and prescription)
Functional classification: Antiulcer agent
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Histamine2 antagonist (H, blocker). Stimulation of acid secretion in the stomach
receptors. Cimetidine and related H2 blockers inhibit the action of histamine on the
histamine H receptor of parietal cells and inhibit gastric parietal cell gastric acid
secretion. Cimetidine increases stomach pH to help heal and prevent gastric and
duodenal ulcers.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Cimetidine is used to treat gastric ulcers and gastritis. Although it is often used for
animals with vomiting, there are no efficacy data to indicate that it is effective.
There also are no efficacy data to support its use for preventing nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced bleeding and ulcers. In dogs, clinical
effcacy is limited and other drugs (e.g., famotidine, ranitidine, and proton-pump
inhibitors) are preferred for ulcer treatment. In horses, cimetidine has been used to
prevent or treat GI ulcers. However, the effcacy for these indications has not been
proved. For example, studies in horses showed that at 18 g/kg q8h PO, it did not
cause healing of ulcers. The poor efficacy may be because of short duration of effect
(2-6 hours). In horses, other drugs (e.g., ranitidine, and proton-pump inhibitors)
are preferred for ulcer treatment. In calves, cimetidine will increase abomasal pH.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects usually seen only with decreased renal clearance. In people, CNS
sgns may occur with high doses.
Contraindications and Precautions
Use cautiously with drugs that rely on hepatic metabolism for clearance.
Drug Interactions
Cimetidine is a well-known cytochrome P450 enzyme inhibitor. It may increase
concentrations of other drugs used concurrently (e.g., theophylline) because of
inhibition of hepatic enzymes. Cimetidine will increase the pH of the stomach,
which can inhibit oral absorption of some drugs (e.g., itraconazole and
 ketoconazole). Cimetidine will inhibit the oral absorption of iron supplements.
Instructions for Use
Efficacy for treating ulcers in animals has not been established. Frequent dosing may
be necessary for suppression of stomach acid. Doses are derived from gastric
secretory studies in experimental animals.

Trade and other names: Cipro and generic brands
Functional classification: Antibacterial
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Fluoroquinolone antibacterial. Acts to inhibit DNA gyrase and cell DNA and
RNA synthesis. Bactericidal. Broad antimicrobial activity. Ciprofloxacin is active
against gram-negative bacilli, including Enterobacteriacene, and some gram-positive
cocci, including Staphylococcns. Ciprofloxacin is more active against Psendomonas
deruginosa than other fluoroquinolones, but resistance is possible. Multi-resistant
bacteria, including gram-negative bacilli of the Enterobacteriacene, and methicillin-

bacteria. Other fluoroquinolones registered for animals have near-complete
bioavailability.
Indications and Clinical Uses
C
Ciprofloxacin, although a human drug, has been used in small animals for treatment
of a wide variety of infections, including skin infections, pneumonia, and soft tissue
infections. Ciprofloxacin is not registered for animals. However, it can be prescribed
by veterinarians, as long as it is not administered to animals that produce food or
are intended for food. The administration of ciprofloxacin to animals is considered
extralabel and subject to other extralabel restrictions. The vaniable and potentially
low ciprofloxacin oral availability for dogs and cats suggests that doses should be
higher than the doses currently used for drugs such as enrofloxacin, marbofloxacin,
or orbifloxacin.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
High concentrations may cause CNS toxicity, especially in animals with renal
failure. Ciprofoxacin causes occasional vomiting. Intravenous solution should
be given slowly (over 30 minutes). At high doses, it may cause some nausea,
vomiting, and diarrhea. Blindness in cats has not been reported for ciprofoxacin.
All of the fluoroquinolones may cause arthropathy in young animals. Dogs are
most susceptible to quinolone-induced arthropathy in the age group of 4 weeks
to 28 weeks of age. Large, rapidly growing dogs are the most susceptible.
Administration to horses may cause severe enteritis and colic.
Contraindications and Precautions
Avoid use in young animals because of risk of cartilage injury. Use cautiously in
animals that may be prone to seizures, such as epileptics. It is not recommended
to administer ciprofloxacin to horses.
Drug Interactions
Fluoroquinolones may increase concentrations of theophylline if used
concurrently. Coadministration with divalent and trivalent cations, such as
products containing aluminum (e.g., sucralfate), iron, and calcium, may decrease
absorption. Do not mix in solutions or in vials with aluminum, calcium, iron, or
zinc because chelation may occur.
Instructions for Use
concentration above minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Eficacy studies
have not been performed in dogs or cats and clinical use is based primarily on
usually l0 mg/mL (in sterile water) or 2 mg/mL (premixed with 5% dextrose).
Dilute the concentrated form to 1-2 mg/mL prior to intravenous use with an
intravenous solution and infuse the final solution over 60 minutes. Do not infise
may occur.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Susceptibility testing: CLSI break point for susceptible organisms has not been
determined for animals, but for humans is ≤l.0 mcg/mL. Most susceptible
156 Cisapride
gram-negative bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae have MIC values less than 0.l mcg/

be higher than other veterinary fluoroquinolones. Otherwise, most bacteria that are
susceptible to ciprofloxacin are also susceptible to other fluoroquinolones.
FormulationsAvailable

Cisapride
Siss'ah-pride
Trade and other names: Propulsid (Prepulsid in Canada), not currently available
commercially
Functional classification: Prokinetic agent
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Prokinetic agent. Its mechanism is believed to be as an agonist for the
5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT4) receptor on myenteric neurons (5-HT4 ordinarily
stimulates cholinergic transmission in the myenteric neurons). It also acts as an
antagonist for the 5-HT3 receptor. Via this mechanism, or independently, cisapride
may enhance release of acetylcholine at the myenteric plexus. Cisapride increases the
motility of the stomach, small intestine, and colon. It accelerates the transit of
contents in the bowel and intestines.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Cisapride is used to stimulate motility for treating gastric reflux, gastroparesis, ileus,
s sad n  au se u ss u s   
regurgitation, decrease postoperative ileus, and treat constipation and megacolon in
cats. It is not effective to stimulate motility in dogs with megaesophagus. Cisapride
was removed from the human market and is no longer commercially available.
Cisapride  157
Compounding pharmacies have made cisapride available to veterinarians in
compounded forms (see Formulations section). However, these formulations are not
licensed and are unregulated.
Precautionary Information
C
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse cardiac effcts have been reported in people and are the cause for
discontinuation in human medicine. These cardiac effects have not been reported
in animals. High overdoses in dogs (l8 mg/kg) have produced abdominal pain,
aggression, ataxia, fever, and vomiting. With higher overdoses, diarrhea, ataxia,
and central nervous system reactions have been observed.
Contraindications and Precautions
Contraindicated in patients with GI obstruction.
Drug Interactions
Anticholinergic drugs, such as atropine, will diminish the action. Cisapride should
not be used with drugs that inhibit metabolism (cytochrome P450 inhibitors) or
Appendix).
Instructions for Use
Not currently available commercially. Cisapride was discontinued by the
manufacturer in July 2000. However, some veterinary pharmacies can fill
some orders or prepare compounded formulations for animals. Consult local
human doses, experimental studies, and anecdotal evidence. Efficacy studies have not
been performed in dogs or cats.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
In humans, cardiac effects have been reported (arrhythmias). Monitor ECG in
susceptible patients.
Formulations
Cisapride was once available in a l0-mg tablet but has been discontinued by the
manufacturer. Formulations used are prepared by compounding from a pure source.
To prepare l mg/mL injectable solution (follow USP <797> sterile compounding
standards), mix 0.104 g of cisapride monhydrate with 20 mL tartaric acid 6%
solution. Add sterile water to make up a l00-mL total volume. Keep the solution in
the refrigerator, in a sterile vial, protected from light, and labeled with Beyond Use
Date of 14 days postcompounding. A 10 mg/mL oral suspension (follow USP
<795> compounding standards) has been prepared by mixing 300 mg (0.3 g) of
cisapride monhydrate with 15 mL Ora Pius and enough Orn Sweet added to make a
total of volume of 30 mL ( Oral Plus and Ora Sweet are oral formulation suspending
agents and vehicles commonly used in commercial pharmacies.)
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature.
Some compounded formulations have been stable for 60 days if the pH is kept
neutral. Injectable solution should be used within 14 days.

Cisplatin
sis-plah'tin 
Trade and other names: Platinol
Functional classification: Anticancer agent
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Anticancer agent. Cisplatin acts like a bifunctional alkylator of DNA but forms a
reactive carbonium ion, and the cross-linking occurs around the platinum ion
bases. As a result of this reaction, interstrand and intrastrand cross-linking of DNA
occurs. The result is inhibition of DNA synthesis. A related drug is carboplatin,
which is a second-generation platinum compound used in patients who may not
tolerate cisplatin.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Cisplatin is used for treating vanious solid tumors, including bronchiogenic
carcinoma, osteosarcoma, transitional cell carcinoma, and mast cell tumors. It has
been shown to be effective for increasing the survival of dogs that have undergone
amputations for osteosarcoma.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Nephrotoxicity is the most limiting factor to cisplatin therapy. In cats, it causes a
dose-related, species-specific, primary pulmonary toxicosis. Vomiting is common
in dogs with administration. Transient thrombocytopenia may occur in dogs.
Cisplatin has caused potassium wasting and depletion of magnesium.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not use in cats.
Drug Interactions
Cisplatin may be used with other cancer chemotherapy agents. Do not use with
other nephrotoxic drugs.
Clarithromycin  159
Instructions for Use
To avoid toxicity, fuid loading before administration using sodium chloride should
be performed. Antiemetic agents are often administered before therapy to decrease
vomiting. For transitional cell and squamous cell carcinomas, doses used are 40 to
50 mg/m? every 2l to 28 days. For osteosarcoma, it has been used at a dose of
70 mg/m? every 2l days for four treatments.
C
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests

Clarithromycin
Kah-rith'roe-mye'sin
Trade and other names: Biaxin and generic brands
Functional classification: Antibiotic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Macrolide antibiotic, with bacteriostatic activity. It is a substituted 1l4-carbon
 macrolide. Clarithromycin was introduced in 1990 as a substitute for erythromycin.
Compared to erythromycin it has higher absorption, a longer half-life, and
increased intracellular uptake. Site of action is similar to other macrolide antibiotics,
which is the 50-S ribosomal subunit in susceptible bacteria. Spectrum includes
primarily gram-positive bacteria. Resistance is expected for most gram-negative
bacteria. Clarithromycin may have higher activity (lower MIC values) for many
bacteria compared to erythromycin or azithromycin. Clarithromycin, like other
macrolides, may have anti-inflammatory properties that are independent of the
microbiologic effects (e.g., inhibit neutrophil and eosinophil inflammatory
reaction). Clarithromycin metabolites may contribute to the activity, but these
metabolites are not well-characterized in animals. Clarithromycin is widely
160 Clarithromycin
distnibuted to intracellular and tissue sites with concentrations in most tissues-
including the respiratory tract—exceeding the plasma concentration. In foals,
half-life is 4.8-5.4 hours with a volume of distribution of 10.5 L/kg and clearance
of 1.27 L/kg/hr. The oral absorption in foals is 57% with a maximum
concentration of 0.5-0.9 mcg/mL.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Most common use in people is for treatment of Helicobacter gastritis and respiratory
infections, where it has retained activity against most respiratory tract pathogens
(e.g., Streptococcus, mycoplasma, chlamydia). In small animals, clarithromycin has
been used for indications such as skin infections and respiratory infections. In foals,
clarithromycin has been used for treatment of infections caused by Rhodococcus equi
(in combination with rifampin) and produced better clinical success than
azithromycin.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
The most common adverse effect from clanithromycin and related drugs is
diarrhea and nausea. Many animals may develop soft feces or mild diarrhea. In
studies in healthy foals, diarrhea was uncommon from oral doses and was
self-limiting. However, if diarrhea becomes severe, treatment should be
discontinued.
Contraindications and Precautions
Administer with caution to adult horses, ruminants, rodents, and rabbits because
diarrhea and enteritis may develop. Use with caution in pregnant animals.
Drug Interactions
Many macrolide antibiotics are cytochrome P450 enzyme inhibitors and can
concentrations. However, specific drug interactions of this nature have not been
documented in animals.
Instructions for Use
and need for a long time above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
In absence of a specific value for clarithromycin, use susceptibility for erythromycin
to guide use of clarithromycin. Although the CLSI-derived break point for
susceptible bacteria is l mcg/mL, cures have been observed when treating
respiratory pathogens with MIC values as high as 8 mcg/mL, which is attributed to
mL. Organisms resistant to erythromycin and azithromycin will most likely be
resistant to clarithromycin.
Formulations
Clarithromycin is available in 250- and 500-mg tablets and 25- and 50-mg/mL oral
suspension.
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature.

Clemastine Fumarate
Klem'ass-teen fyoo'mar-ate
Trade and other names: Tavist, and generic brands
Functional classification: Antihistamine
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antihistamine (Hj-blocker). Similar to other antihistamines, it acts by blocking the
H, receptor and suppresses inflammatory reactions caused by histamine. The H,
blockers have been used to control pruritus and skin inflammation in dogs and cats;
however, success rates in dogs have not been high. Commonly used antihistamines
include clemastine, chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine, and hydroxyzine.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Used primarily for treatment of allergy. Some reports have suggested that clemastine
is effective for pruritus in dogs. However, the half-life in dogs is short (3.8 hours),
and it has rapid clearance. After oral administration the oral absorption is only 3%
(20%-70% in humans). At a high dose of 0.5 mg/kg PO, it did not suppress
intradermal skin reactions. This evidence suggests that oral administration may not
be as effective in dogs as previously thought. Oral absorption studies in horses
indicated that it is not absorbed when given orally (bioavailability was only 3%).
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Sedation is the most common side effect. Sedation is the result of inhibition of
histamine N-methyltransferase. Sedation may also be attributed to block of other
CNS receptors such as those for serotonin, acetylcholine, and alpha-receptors.
Antimuscarinic effects (atropine-like effects) also are possible, such as dry mouth
and decreased GI secretions.
Contraindications and Precautions
No contraindications reported for animals.
Drug Interactions

Clenbuterol
klen-byoo'ter-ole
Trade and other names: Ventipulmin
Functional classification: Bronchodilator, beta agonist
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Beta2-adrenergic agonist (beta2/beta) ratio = 4.0). Bronchodilator. Stimulates
betaz receptors to relax bronchial smooth muscle. It also may inhibit release of
inflammatory mediators, especially from mast cells. Compared to terbutaline, it has
lower effcacy because of lower intrinsic activity, and it is only a partial agonist.
Clenbuterol differs from other beta agonists because it resists O-sulfate ester
conjugation, which produces a longer half-life. It also has better oral absorption
(83%) than other beta agonists in horses. In horses, the plasma half-life is 13 hours,
but in urine it can be detected for 12 days. In addition to the effects on respiratory
smooth muscle, clenbuterol also can produce repartitioning effects, which indicates
Clenbuterol 163
that it will stimulate development of more muscle and less fat. Because of this use, it
has been abused in humans and used illegally in food-producing animals.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Clen buterol is indicated for treatment of animals with reversible bronchoconstriction
such as horses with recurrent airway obstruction (RAO), fomerly called chronic
C
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Studies have demonstrated effects in horses,
effects (producing less fat), but it has also decreased exercise capacity and increased
rate of fatigue. It should not be used in animals intended for food.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Clenbuterol may produce excessive beta-adrenergic stimulation at high doses
(tachycardia and tremors). Arhythmias occur at high doses. Chronic use may
have adverse effects on cardiac function in healthy horses.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not administer to animals intended for food. Veteninanians should be warned
that clenbuterol is abused in humans for the purpose of muscle-building and
weight loss. Subsequently, high doses in humans may cause cardiac toxicity, such
as arrhythmias.
Drug Interactions
Because clenbuterol is a beta agonist, other adrenergic drugs will potentiate the
action. In addition, beta-blocking drugs will decrease action. Use with caution
with any other drug that may stimulate the heart.
Instructions for Use
Oral administration for horses. Clenbuterol has not been used in small animals. It is
prohibited for use in animals intended for food.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor heart rate in animals during treatment. Clenbuterol can be detected in
urine for 12 days. Effective plasma concentrations are 500 pg/mL.
Formulations
Clenbuterol is available in 100- and 33-mL bottles of 72.5 mcg/mL syrup.
Stability and Storage

klin-dah-mye'sin hye-droe-klor'ide
Trade and other names: Antirobe, Clindrops, Clindarobe, Clintabs, Clinsol, and
generic (veterinary preparations) and Cleocin (human preparations)
Functional classification: Antibactenial
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antibacterial drug of the lincosamide class (similar in action to macrolides). It shares
structural, microbiologic activity, and other properties with lincomycin. It inhibits
bacterial protein synthesis via inhibition of bacterial ribosome. Clindamycin is
bacteriostatic with a spectrum of activity primarily against gram-positive bacteria and
anaerobes. Clindamycin, like the macrolide antibiotics, can concentrate in leukocytes
 d s    sn  
such as Staphylococcns, Streptococcns, and gram-positive rods such as Corynebacterinm.
Clindamycin also is active against mycoplasma and anaerobic organisms, although
not all Bacteroides species are susceptible. Activity against Toxoplasma is
controversial. In dogs the volume of distribution (VD) is 2.5 L/kg, the oral
absorption is 73%, and the half-life is 4-4.5 hours after a dose of 5.5 mg/kg and
7-10 hours after a dose of ll mg/kg.
Indications and Clinical Uses

involving the skin, respiratory tract, or oral cavity. Resistance with Stapylococcus
may occur. It is effective for some oral infections and anaerobic infections. It also
has been used for Mycoplasma infections. Efficacy of clindamycin for treating
toxoplasmosis is controversial. Some studies have shown that clindamycin improved
clinical signs, but it did not resolve the infection. Another study showed that
clindamycin inhibited killing of Toxopiasma organisms by leukocytes.

Instructions for Use
Most doses are based on manufacturer's drug approval data and efficacy trials.
Although every-l2-hour frequency is recommended most often for dogs, there are
studies that demonstrate effcacy when administered at ll mg/kg every 24 hours for
treatment of pyoderma. An injectable formulation is also available (Cleocin), which
is clindamycin phosphate. This may be injected either IV or IM. If administering
clindamycin IV, it should be diluted and administered by slow infusion (30-60
minutes). Dilution is usually l0:l in 0.9% saline. It contains benzyl alcohol, and
this vehicle has produced toxic reactions in young infants (and perhaps small
animals).

C
Functional classification: Behavior modification
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Tricyclic antidepressant drug (TCA). Used in people to treat anxiety and depression.
Action is via inhibition of uptake of serotonin at presynaptic nerve terminals.
Beneficial effects may be caused primarily by blocking reuptake of serotonin and
modulation of serotonin in areas of the brain that affect anxiety and behavior.
Clomipramine has more serotonin-reuptake blocking effects than other TCA drugs.
Side effects result from antimuscarinic effects caused by the active metabolite
desmethylclomipramine. However, animals produce less of this metabolite than
people do.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Like other TCAs, clomipramine is used in animals to treat various behavioral
disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorders (also called canine compulsive
treating compulsive disorders; however, it does not appear to be beneficial when
used for dominance-related aggression. In cats, with long-term treatment it has been

returned to urine marking abruptly after drug was discontinued. It has not been
effective for psychogenic alopecia in cats.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Reported adverse effects include sedation and reduced appetite. Clomipramine
has a bitter taste. Other side effects associated with TCAs are antimuscarinic
effects (dry mouth, rapid heart rate, and urine retention) and antihistamine
clomipramine, antimuscarinic effects may be caused by an active metabolite.
Clomipramine can decrease total T4 and free-T4 thyroid concentrations in dogs,
but it may still be within normal reference ranges. Overdoses can produce
ife-threatening cardiotoxicity. If an overdose occurs, immediately contact a
poison control center. In trials performed in cats, no significant adverse effects
were observed.
Contraindications and Precautions
Use cautiously in patients with heart disease.
Drug Interactions
 Do not use with other behavior-modifying drugs such as serotonin reuptake
inhibitors. Do not use with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), such as
selegiline or amitraz.

Clopidogrel
kloe-pid'oh-grel
Trade and other names: Plavix
Functional classification: Antiplatelet drug
170 Clopidogrel
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Clopidogrel is a platelet inhibitor. It is a thienopyridine and inhibits adenosine
diphosphate (ADP) receptor-mediated platelet activity. A related drug is ticlopidine.
Because this mechanism is different from the aspinin-inhibiting effect on platelets,
clopidogrel is more effective than aspinin alone and has been used concurrently with
aspinin. Clopidogrel is metabolized to an active metabolite that exerts its antiplatelet
effect. In cats, clopidogrel produced antiplatelet effects that persisted for 3 days after
discontinuation of the drug. Clopidogrel administration also decreased serotonin
release from platelets in cats, which may be important because serotonin release may
contribute to clinical signs of thromboemboli in cats. In dogs and horses, oral
administration has produced significant inhibitory effects on platelets that are
superior to aspirin.
Indicationsand ClinicalUses
Clopidogrel is used to inhibit platelets in patients that are prone to forming

ticlopidine (Ticlid) which should not be used in cats because it produces adverse
reactions. In cats clopidogrel has been recommended to prevent cardiogenic arterial
thromboembolism associated with cats with heart disease. In dogs it has been used
to prevent embolism caused by heartworm disease and other conditions. In dogs, at
a dose of either 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg, decreased ADP-induced platelet aggregation
occurs for 3 days after discontinuation of drug administration in some dogs and
longer than 7 days in others. At 2 mg/kg orally, q24h, clopidogrel significantly
suppressed platelet activity in horses, which persisted for 6 days after the last dose.

Instructions for Use
 Administer with, or without, aspirin in patients prone to thrombi and emboli. The
dose in cats of 19 mg is approximately one fourth of a human tablet. It is likely that
smaller doses are effective, but they have not been evaluated because it is impractical

Cloprostenol Sodium
Kloe pros' te nole
Trade and other names: Estrumate, estroPLAN
Functional classification: Prostaglandin
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Cloprostenol is a snythetic prostaglandin, structurally related to PGF2-alpha, that
produces PGF2-alpha effects. Synthetic prostaglandins are much more potent than
natural prostaglandins, and one should not use these at the same dose as natural
prostaglandins. Prostaglandin F2 analogues have a direct luteolytic action on the
corpus luteum (Luteolysis). In nonpregnant cycling cattle, this effect will result in
starting estrus 2 to 5 days after injection. In pregnant animals, it will terminate
pregnancy. In animals with prolonged luteal activity that have pyometra, mummifed
fetus, or luteal cysts, the luteolysis usually results in resolution of the problem and
return to normal cycling.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Cloprostenol has been used in cattle to induce luteolysis (beef and dairy cattle) to
manipulate the timing of the estrus cycle to benefit breeding management practices.
It also can be used to terminate pregnancy resulting from undesired mating and to
treat conditions associated with prolonged luteal function (e.g, Pyometra, luteal

a corpus luteum. Most reports on successful termination of pregnancy have been
performed on cattle, horses, and dogs. In dogs, cloprostenol has been administered
in combination with other drugs (e.g., cabergoline [Dostinex] and bromocriptine
[Parlodel]) to terminate pregnancy. When used to terminate pregnancy, it has been
almost l00% effective. In horses, it has been administered to induce premature labor
in the last 2-4 weeks of pregnancy.
172 Cloprostenol Sodium
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Induces abortion in pregnant animals. High doses in cattle (50 and 100x dose)
have caused discomfort, milk letdown, and some frothing. There are no long-
term effects on fertility. Endometnitis can occur in some animals after treatment
and diarrhea can be seen 15-45 minutes after injection. In dogs, for termination
of pregnancy, side effects have been mild but may include vomiting, nausea, and
panting, occurring shortly after the injection and lasting for approximately 15-20
minutes. To avoid vomiting, it is recommended to wait 8 hours after feeding.
Abortion may be followed by l week (approximately) of mucoid vulvar discharge
Mammary enlargement and mild milk production may occur in some dogs.
Contraindications and Precautions
Synthetic prostaglandins are much more potent than natural prostaglandins, so
observe doses carefully to avoid overdose of the synthetic forms. Handle with
caution. Cloprostenol can be absorbed through intact skin, so human exposure
should be avoided. It is recommended that all women should avoid handling
cloprostenol. Humans with respiratory problems should avoid contact with
cloprostenol because it can induce an asthma reaction
Instructions for Use
Give injections to cattle IM. When cloprostenol is injected in cattle, return to estrus
activity usually occurs in 3 to 5 days, at which time animals may be inseminated. In
some cases, a second injection may be given ll days after the first injection (double-
injection plan), with estrus occurring at 2-5 days after the second injection. When

Clorazepate Dipotassium
Klor-az'eh-pate dye-poe-tah'see-um
Trade and other names: Tranxene and genenic
Functional classification: Anticonvulsant
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Benzodiazepine. Clorazepate is one of the active metabolites of diazepam, producing
similar effects as diazepam but longer acting. After oral absorption it is quickly
converted to the active drug, referred to as nordiazepam or desmethyldiazepam
Similar to diazepam and other benzodiazepines, its action is to enhance inhibitory
effects of GABA in the central nervous system.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Clorazepate is used for antiseizure action, sedation, and treatment of some
behavioral disorders. It has been used in dogs and cats when other drugs are not
effective. It has been used in refractory epileptics, but tolerance may develop to the
anticonvulsant effects with long-term use.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects

Koe'deen
Trade and other names: Generic, codeine phosphate, and codeine sulfate
Functional classification: Analgesic, opioid, antitussive
176  Codeine
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Opiate agonist, analgesic. Mechanism is similar to morphine, except with
approximately l/l0 potency of morphine. Codeine is extensively metabolized. In
dogs, oral absorption is low (<5%) but it is rapidly converted to other metabolites
that may have analgesic activity, such as glucuronidated forms of codeine. The
activity of codeine and perhaps some active metabolites is to bind to mu receptors
and kappa-opiate receptors on nerves and inhibit release of neurotransmitters
release of some inflammatory mediators. Central sedative and euphoric effects are
related to mu-receptor effects in brain.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Codeine, or codeine with acetaminophen, is indicated for treatment of moderate
pain. It also has been used as an antitussive. Despite the widespread use of codeine
in humans, the efficacy in animals for its antitussive or analgesic use has not been
established. Oral absorption in dogs is low. Because a small portion of codeine is
converted to morphine (only l0% in people) and duration of morphine is short in
dogs, the clinical effectiveness of codeine in dogs may be questionable.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Like all opiates, side effects from codeine are predictable and unavoidable. Side
effects include sedation, constipation, and bradycardia. Respiratory depression
occurs with high doses.
Contraindications and Precautions
 Schedule II controlled substance. Tolerance and dependence occurs with chronic
administration. High doses (60-mg tablet with acetaminophen) can cause
Some codeine formulations may contain other ingredients (e.g., acetaminophen)
that should not be administered to cats.
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions are reported in animals. However, it will potentiate effects
from other sedatives and CNS depressants.
Instructions for Use
Available as codeine phosphate and codeine sulfate oral tablets. Doses listed
for analgesia are considered initial doses; individual patients may need higher
doses depending on degree of tolerance or pain threshold. When administering
acetaminophen-codeine combinations, the high-dose tablet (containing 60-mg
dose (containing 30 mg) is recommended.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor patient's heart rate and respiration. Although bradycardia rarely needs to be
treated when it is caused by an opioid, if necessary, atropine can be administered. If
senious respiratory depression occurs, the opioid can be reversed with naloxone.
Formulations
Codeine is available in 15-, 30-, and 60-mg tablets, 5-mg/mL syrup, and 3-mg/mL
oral solution. It is also available in formulations with acetaminophen.

Trade and other names: Acthar
Functional classification: Hormone
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Corticotropin (ACTH). Corticotropin is a natural peptide hormone, composed of
39 amino acids. The formulation is prepared into a gel for injection. It stimulates
normal synthesis of cortisol and other homones from adrenal cortex.
Indications and Clinical Uses
ACTH is used for diagnostic purposes to evaluate adrenal gland finction. Another
closely related synthetic product, cosyntropin, is used for the same purpose. The
availability of Acthar gel has been limited, and cosyntropin is often used as a
substitute. Compounded formulations may not be equivalent.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects unlikely when used as single injection for diagnostic purposes.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not administer IV.
Drug Interactions
There are no drug interactions reported for small animals
180   Cosyntropin
Instructions for Use
Doses are established by measuring normal adrenal response in animals. See also
Cosyntropin, which is sometimes preferred for clinical use. However, availability and
cost of cosyntropin and ACTH are the factors that usually determine which is used
in small animals.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor cortisol concentrations. Post-ACTH cortisol response should be as
follows:
Dogs 5.5-20.0 mcg/dL; > 20 mcg/dL is consistent with hyperadrenocorticism.
Cats 4.5-15 mcg/dL; > 15 mcg/dL is consistent with hyperadrenocorticism.
 Following treatment for hyperadrenocorticism (e.g., treatment with mitotane)
response should be 1-5 mcg/dL.

can be administered IV, but ACTH gel cannot. Cosyntropin is also more potent
than ACTH. Administration of cosyntropin will stimulate secretion of cortisol from
Cosyntropin  181
adrenal glands. Administration of cosyntropin also will stimulate secretion of sex
hormones of adrenal origin.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Cosyntropin is used for diagnostic purposes to evaluate adrenal gland function.
Maximum peak cortisol secretion occurs at 60-90 minutes. It is used for the same
purpose as corticotropin, but in humans it is preferred over corticotropin because it
is less allergenic.

Contraindications and Precautions
Maximum dose for dogs should be 250 mcg.
Drug Interactions
There are no drug interactions reported for small animals
Instructions for Use
 Use for diagnostic purposes only; it is not intended for treatment of
hypoadrenocorticism. Cosyntropin is prefered to ACTH gel because it is available
in a fomulation that is easier to use in dogs and cats. In dogs, cosyntropin has been
administered at 5 mcg/kg IV or IM and 250 mcg/dog IM. All three protocols
produce similar results and IM injection produces similar results as IV injection.

Cyclophosphamide
sye-kloe-foss'fah-mide
Trade and other names: Cytoxan, Neosar, and CTX
Functional classification: Anticancer agent
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Cytotoxic and anticancer agent. Cyclophosphamide belongs to the group of
nitrogen mustards. They are alkylating agents (bifunctional alkylating agents) that
alkylate various macromolecules but preferentially alkylate the N-7 of the guanine
base of DNA. They are cytotoxic to cancer cells and are toxic to the rapidly dividing
cells of the bone marrow. Cyclophosphamide must be metabolized to active
184   Cyclophosphamide
metabolites for pharmacologic effect, which requires P-450 enzyme activation.
The metabolites, hydroxyphosphamide and aldophosphamide, are cytotoxic.
Aldophosphamide is converted at the tissue site to phosphoramide mustard and
   a     r 
cystitis). The half-life of the parent drug in dogs is 4-6.5 hours.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Cyclophosphamide is used primarily as adjunct for cancer chemotherapy and as
nitrogen mustards. It is used in chemotherapy protocols for a variety of tumors,
carcinomas, sarcomas, feline lymphoproliferative diseases, mast cell tumor, mammary
carcinoma, and especially lymphoproliferative tumors (lymphoma). Cancer protocols
such as cyclophosphamide, Oncovin, and prednisone (COP) and cyclophosphamide,
hydroxydaunomycin, Oncovin, and prednisone (CHOP) incorporate
for immunosuppression. Although it has been used for various immune-mediated
disorders in animals {immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, pemphigus, systemic
lupus erythematosus [SLE]), efficacy has not been reported in controlled studies for
these diseases. In one trial it was shown that cyclophosphamide (50 mg/m?) had no
benefit over prednisolone alone for treatment of immune-mediated hemolytic
anemia (J Vet Intern Med, 17: 206-212,2003).
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Cyclophosphamide is toxic to the bone marrow in a dose-dependent manner.
After a single large bolus dose, the nadir of toxicity occurs in 7-l0 days, but the
effect is reversible because stem cells are usually unaffected. Recovery usually
Dccurs in 2l-28 days. Vomiting and diarrhea may occur in some patients. Sterile,
hemorrhagic cystitis is a senious and limiting complication to therapy. It is caused
by the toxic effects of metabolites on the bladder epithelium {especially acrolein)
that are concentrated and excreted in the urine. Various attempts are used to
decrease the injury to the bladder epithelium. Corticosteroids are usually
administered with cyclophosphamide to induce polyuria and decrease
inflammation of the bladder. The drug mesna (Mesnex, mercaptoethane
sulfonate) provides free active thiol groups to bind metabolites of
cyclophosphamide in the unine. Furosemide (2.2 mg/kg) administered at the
same time as the cyclophosphamide dose may decrease risk of sterile hemorrhagic
cystitis. Cats are less susceptible to developing cystitis compared to dogs.
Cyclophosphamide may cause hair loss when used in some chemotherapeutic
protocols. Dogs most susceptible are those with continuously growing hair (e.g.,
poodles and Old English sheepdogs). Cats do not tend to lose hair from
cyclophosphamide treatment.
Contraindications and Precautions
Bone marrow suppressive and immunosuppressive. Use cautiously in animals at
risk for infection. Teratogenic and embryotoxic. Do not use in pregnancy.
Drug Interactions
Use cautiously with other drugs that may cause bone marrow suppression.
Although this drug is highly metabolized to active metabolites, it is not known
what effect other drugs have on enzyme activity.
Cyclophosphamide  185
Instructions for Use
Cyclophosphamide is usually administered with other drugs (other cancer drugs in
cancer protocols or corticosteroids when used for immunosuppressive therapy).
Consult specific anticancer protocols for specific regimens. For example, the COAP
protocol (COAP is a combination of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone,
and cytosine arabinoside) uses 50 mg/m? orally, every 48 hours, with vincristine,
C
cytosine arabinoside, and predmisone for 8 weeks, but one CHOP protocol uses
100-150 mg/m? IV on the frst day of the protocol, followed by other drugs such
as doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone. In dogs, the maximum tolerated dose is
500 mg/m? IV (with autologous bone marrow support).
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor CBC in animals during treatment. Monitor urinalysis in dogs during
treatment.
Formulations
Cyclophosphamide is available in 25 mg/mL injection and 25- and 50-mg tablets.
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room
temperature. Tablets are coated and should not be split in order to retain
stability. Do not let temperatures exceed 30°C. Subject to hydrolysis in aqueous
solutions. Use reconstituted solutions within 24 hours at room temperature and
within 6 days if refigerated, although some refrigerated solutions have been stable
for 60 days.

also inhibits the mitochondrial permeability-transition pores that may attenuate
(average) in dogs and 8-10 hours (average) in cats. However, there is high
vaniability on both species. Oral absorption is low (20%-30%) and may be affected by
food and drug interactions.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Cyclosporine use for keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) is limited to topical
administration. Systemic uses (usually oral) for cyclosporine include immune-
mediated hemolytic anemia, atopy in dogs, and perianal fistulas. Other diseases have
been treated with cyclosporine, such as sebaceous adenitis, idiopathic sterile nodular
panniculitis, immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA), inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD), immune-mediated polyarthritis, myasthenia gravis, and aplastic
anemia. It has also been used for treatment of granulomatous meningoencephalitis
(3-6 mg/kg ql2h). In dogs evidence is established for treatment of atopic
dermatitis, for which there is similar effcacy as prednisolone. However, there is
minimal effectiveness for immune-mediated pemphigus. In dogs, some
dermatologists have reported improved efficacy when combined with azathioprine
for immune-mediated diseases (e.g., PF). In cats, cyclosporine has shown beneficial
effects for treatment of eosinophilic granuloma complex, inflammatory bowel
disease, atopic dermatitis (60% effective), stomatitis, and airway disease (feline
asthma). In horses it is effective as a localized treatment of anterior uveitis.

Contraindications and Precautions
Do not use in pregnancy. Warn animal owners to keep out of reach of children.
If used with other drugs, consult Drug Interactions section for possible
interference.
Drug Interactions
Cimetidine, erythromycin, fluconazole, or ketoconazole may increase cyclosporine
concentrations when used concurrently. Doses of ketoconazole of 2.5 to l0 mg/
kg/day in dogs have been shown to substantially decrease the clearance of
cyclosponine and reduce the required dose by one half or more. Grapefruit juice
also inhibits clearance and will reduce the required dose, although high doses are
needed. Food will decrease oral absorption by 15%-22%.
Instructions for Use
Atopica (veterinary) and Neoral (human) are identical formulations, except that sizes
of capsules vary. After animals have been treated with initial doses of 5 mg/kg per
day and are stable, doses may be adjusted by increasing the interval to once every
other day, or every third day, rather than lowering daily dose. Individual doses may
be adjusted by monitoring of blood concentrations, but monitoring is not necessary
for routine use. Atopica and Neoral oral products are absorbed more predictably
than Sandimmune. Atopica and Neoral may produce 50% higher blood
concentrations in some patients or reduce the variability in absorption that was
associated with the Sandimmune fomulations. Feeding may reduce oral absorption
in dogs but does not decrease efficacy. Genenic formulations are available for
humans, but have not been evaluated for bioequivalence to Atopica in dogs. Oral
solution can be diluted to make it more palatable. To reduce the dose, some
veterinarians have administered ketoconazole or other enzyme-inhibiting compounds
concurrently. When used to treat animals for organ transplantation, the doses are
generally higher and the blood concentrations maintained at a higher level.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Although routine blood concentration monitoring is not necessary, it may be
helpful to identify drug interactions, poor absorption, or poor compliance. When
monitoring, collect whole blood in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA; purple-
top) tube for submission to laboratory. Suggested trough blood concentration range
(whole blood assay) is 300-400 ng/mL, although in some studies, levels as low
as 200 ng/mL have been effective. If the assay uses fluorescence polarization
to as the TDx method), the feline measured concentration should be multiplied by
0.5 to arnive at a true value; the canine measured concentration should be multiplied
by 0.65 to arrive at a drug value. Cyclosporine does not interfere with intradermal
skin testing.

190  Cytarabine
Cytarabine
sye-tare'ah-been
Trade and other names: Cytosar, Ara-C, and Cytosine arabinoside
Functional classification: Anticancer agent
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Anticancer agent. Cytarabine (Cytosar) is a compound isolated from a sea sponge.
It has also been referred to as cytosine arabinoside and Ara-C. Cytarabine is
metabolized to an active drug that inhibits DNA synthesis. It was once thought that
its action was via inhibition of the enzyme DNA polymerase, but the exact mechanism
of action may not be known. The half-life in dogs is approximately 70 minutes.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Cytarabine has been used for lymphoma and leukemia protocols. The most common
use of cytarabine is treatment of lymphoma and myelogenous leukemia. It is usually
administered as an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection because it has a short
half-life (approximately 20 minutes) when administered IV. It has also been
administered to dogs for treatment of granulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis as
an alternative to corticosteroids.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Cytarabine is bone marrow suppressive and can cause granulocytopenia, especially
when delivered via continuous rate infusions. In addition, it may cause nausea
and vomiting.
Contraindications and Precautions
Use cautiously in animals administered other bone marrow-suppressing drugs.
Drug Interactions
There are no drug interactions reported for small animals.
Instructions for Use
Cytarabine has been administered to dogs using a variety of protocols (see dosing
section), depending on the study published and dependent on clinician preference.
There is not strong evidence that one protocol is superior to another. When treating
granulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis, dose protocols (either IV or SQ) have
used total doses of 200 to 400 mg/m? total dose, divided over 2 days, either as SQ
 injections twice daily for 2 days, or an IV infusion with the total dose given over
8 hours.
Consult anticancer protocols for precise dosing regimens.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor CBC to assess toxicity.
Formulations
Cytarabine is available in a l 00-mg vial for injection.

Dalteparin 193
Dalteparin
dahl'tah-pare-in
Trade and other names: Fragmin and LMWH
Functional classification: Anticoagulant
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), also known as fragmented heparin.
LMWH is characterized by a molecular weight of approximately 5000, compared
to conventional heparin (unfractionated, or UFH) with a molecular weight of
approximately 15,000. Subsequently, the absorption, clearance, and activity of
LMWH differ from UFH. LMWHs produce their effect by binding to antithrombin
(AT) and increasing antithrombin III-mediated inhibition of synthesis and activity
of coagulation factor Xa. However, LMWH, unlike conventional heparin, produces
less inhibition of thrombin (factor IIa). LMWH's activity is described by the
Anti-factor Xa/Anti-factor IIa ratio. For dalteparin, the ratio is 2.7: 1 (conventional
unfractionated heparin ratio is l :l). In people, LMWHs have several advantages
compared to UFH and include greater anti-Xa/IIa activity, more complete and
predictable absorption from injection, longer duration, less frequent administration,
reduced risk of bleeding, and a more predictable anticoagulant response. However,
 in dogs and cats, the half-life of LMWH is much shorter than in humans, reducing
some of this advantage. In dogs the half-life of dalteparin is approximately 2 hours;
in cats it is estimated to be l.5 hours, which requires much more frequent
administration in either species to maintain anti-Xa activity compared to humans.
LMWHs used in veterinary medicine include tinzaparin (Innohep), enoxaparin
(Lovenox), and dalteparin (Fragmin).
Indications and Clinical Uses
Dalteparin, like other LMWHs, is used to treat hypercoagulability disorders and
prevent coagulation disorders such as thromboembolism, venous thrombosis,
Clinical indications are derived from uses of conventional heparin or extrapolated
from human medicine. There have been few clinical studies to examine efficacy of
LMWH in animals. Previously published doses extrapolated from humans (100
units/kg ql2h, SQ) have been shown not to produce adequate and consistent
anti-Xa activity in dogs and cats and the doses listed in this entry are needed for
therapy.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Although better tolerated than regular heparin, bleeding is a risk. LMWHs
are associated with a lower incidence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in
people, but heparin-induced thrombocytopenia from any form of heparin has
not been a clinical problem in animals. If excessive anticoagulation and bleeding
Occur as a result of an overdose, protamine sulfate should be administered to
reverse heparin therapy. Protamine dose is 1.0 mg protamine for every 100 U
dalteparnin administered by slow IV infision. Protamine complexes with heparin
to form a stable, inactive compound.
194 Dalteparin
Contraindications and Precautions
 Do not administer IM to prevent hematoma; administer SQ only. LMWH is
excreted by renal clearance in animals; therefore, if renal disease is present, the
elimination will be prolonged. Rebound hypercoagulability may occur after
discontinuation of heparin treatment; therefore, it may be advised to taper the
dose slowly when discontinuing treatment.
Drug Interactions
 Do not mix with other injectable drugs. Use cautiously in animals that are
already receiving other drugs that can interfere with coagulation, such as aspinin
and warfarin. Although a specific interaction has not been identified, use
such as glycosaminoglycans for treatment of arthritis. Some antibiotics, suchs as
cephalosporins, may inhibit coagulation.
Instructions for Use
Dosing recommendations extrapolated from human medicine are not appropriate for
animals. Animal owners should be warned that LMWHs are expensive compared to
conventional heparin. When dosing, do not interchange doses on a unit-for-unit
basis with other heparins.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitoring patients for clinical signs of bleeding problems. When administering
LMWH, aPTT and PT clotting times are not reliable indicators of therapy, although
prolonged aPTT is a sign of overdosing. Anti-Xa activity is considered the preferred
laboratory measure of LMWH activity. Peak anti-Xa activity occurs 2 hours after
dosing, and the target range for anti-Xa activity should be 0.5-l.0 U/mL for cats
and 0.4-0.8 U/mL for dogs.
Formulations
Dalteparin is available in 2500 units anti-factor Xa (l6 mg dalteparin sodium) per
0.2 mL in a single-dose syninge; 5000 units anti-factor Xa (32 mg dalteparin
sodium) per 0.2 mL in a single-dose syringe; and 10,000 units anti-factor Xa
(64 mg dalteparin sodium) per mL in a 9.5 mL multiple-dose vial.

Deracoxib
dare-ah-koks'ib
Trade and other names: Deramaxx
Functional classification: Anti-inflammatory
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Deracoxib is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Like other drugs in
this class, deracoxib produces analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting
the synthesis of prostaglandins. The enzyme inhibited by NSAID is the cyclo-
oxygenase (COX) enzyme. The COX enzyme exists in two isoforms called COX-1
and COX-2. COX-1 is primarily responsible for synthesis of prostaglandins
important for maintaining a healthy GI tract, renal function, platelet function,
and other normal functions. COX-2 is induced and responsible for synthesizing
prostaglandins that are important mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever.
However, it is known that there is some crossover of COX-l and COX-2 effects in
some situations and COX-2 activity is important for some biological effects.
Deracoxib, using in vitro assays, is more COX-l sparing compared to older NSAIDs
and is a selective inhibitor of COX-2. The COX-1/COX-2 ratio is high compared
to some other drugs registered for dogs. It also is a selective COX-2 inhibitor in
cats. It has not been established if the specificity for COX-1l or COX-2 is related to
efficacy or safety. Deracoxib has a half-life of 3 hours in dogs at 2-3 mg/kg and 19
sop ul %06 s! uondiosqe [eio 'punoq uanoid Auay si 1I Sy/su 0z ie sinoy
Feeding delays absorption but does not diminish overall absorption. In cats the

the acute and chronic treatment of pain and inflammation in dogs. One of the
most common uses is osteoarthnitis but also has been used for pain associated with

Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
GI problems are the most often adverse effects associated with NSAIDs and can
include vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, ulcers, and erosions of the GI tract. Gastric
and duodenal ulcers have been reported from use of deracoxib in dogs. In field
tials with deracoxib, vomiting was the most often reported adverse effect. Renal
toxicity, especially in dehydrated animals or animals with preexisting renal disease,
has been shown for some NSAIDs. In studies performed in dogs, higher doses
(five times the dose) caused azotemia in normal dogs.
Contraindications and Precautions
Dogs and cats with preexisting GI or renal problems may be at a greater risk of
adverse effects from NSAIDs. Safety in pregnancy is not known, but adverse effects
 pregnant animals, or lactating animals. In cats, use only as a single dose.
Drug Interactions
 Do not administer with other NSAIDs or with corticosteroids. Corticosteroids
have been shown to exacerbate the GI adverse effects. Some NSAIDs may
interfere with the action of diuretic drugs and angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE) inhibitors.
InstructionsforUse
Chewable tablets can be administered with or without food. Long-term studies have
not been completed in cats, only single-dose studies have been reported.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor GI signs for evidence of diarrhea, GI bleeding, or ulcers. Because of risk of
renal injury, monitor renal parameters (water consumption, BUN, creatinine, and
uine-specific gravity) periodically during treatment. Deracoxib does not appear to
affect thyroid hormone assays in dogs.
Formulations
Deracoxib is available in 25-, 75-, and 100-mg chewable tablets.

Regulatory Information
Do not administer to animals that produce food.
RCI Classification: 4
Desmopressin Acetate
dess-moe-press'in ass'ih-tate
Trade and other names: DDAVP
Functional classification: Hormone
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Synthetic peptide similar to antidiuretic hormone (ADH). It produces similar effects
as natural ADH and is used to treat diabetes insipidus (DI) in animals. This action
is related to stimulation of permeability to water to increase water reabsorption in
the distal renal tubule. The difference between DDAVT and natural ADH is that
DDAVP is longer acting and produces fewer vasoconstriction effects. In addition to
the hormone effects, in humans administration of DDAVP results in a twofold to
fivefold increase in the plasma von Willebrand factor. It may induce a 50% increase
in von Willebrand factor in some animals but not as consistently as when
administered to people.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Desmopressin is used as replacement therapy for patients with DI and also has been
used for treatment of patients with mild to moderate von Willebrand's disease prior
        d    
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
No side effects reported. In people, it has rarely caused thrombotic events.
Contraindications and Precautions
There are no specific contraindications.
Drug Interactions
Administration of urea and fludrocortisone will increase the antidiuretic effects.
Instructions for Use
Desmopressin is used only for central forms of DI. Duration of effect is variable (8-20
hours) but typically has a duration of 8-12 hours. It is ineffective for treatment of
nephrogenic diabetes insipidus or polyuria from other causes. Intranasal product has
been administered as eye drops in dogs. Onset of effect is within l hour. Oral tablets
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor water intake and urinalysis to assess therapy. Desmopressin may be used as
a test for DI in animals. To perform this test, administer 2 mcg/kg SQ or IV or
20 mcg intranasally or in the eye. This should be followed by monitoring of urine
concentration and the animal's body weight. Increase in urine concentrating ability
may indicate a diagnosis of DI.

Detomidine Hydrochloride
deh-toe'mih-deen hye-droe-klor'ide
Trade and other names: Dormosedan, Domosedan Gel
Functional classification: Alphaz Analgesic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Alpha2 adrenergic agonist. Alpha2 agonists decrease release of neurotransmitters from
 s s s    sd  u a
binding to presynaptic alphaz receptors (negative feedback receptors). The result is
decreased sympathetic outflow, analgesia, sedation, and anesthesia. Detomidine gel is
absorbed from the oral mucous membrane with bioavailability in horses of 22%.
Other drugs in this class include xylazine, dexmedetomidine, medetomidine,
romifdine, and clonidine.
Indications and Clinical Uses
 Detomidine is used primarily as a sedative, anesthetic adjunct, and analgesia. It is
used in horses more often than in other species. When used to treat pain from colic

Detomidine also has been administered for epidural analgesia. For pain, detomidine
appears to be more potent and longer acting than xylazine. Detomidine in the gel
form (Dormosedan Gel) for horses is administered orally to produce mucosal
absorption. It is indicated for producing minor standing sedation to facilitate minor
procedures (shoeing, clipping, trimming) or calming a fractious horse. Onset of

Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
At typical doses, sedation, ataxia, swaying, sweating, and bradycardia are
common. Cardiac depression, AV block, and hypotension are possible with high
doses. In some horses, hyperresponsiveness to stimuli occurs. Diuresis occurs as a
consequence of the hyperglycemia produced by alpha2 agonists such as
detomidine. Yohimbine (0.ll mg/kg) can be used to reverse effects of alpha2
agonists such as detomidine. In small animals, atipamezole also can be used to
reverse effects from detomidine.
Contraindications and Precautions
Concurrent use of detomidine with sulfonamides IV can lead to cardiac
arrhythmias. Xylazine causes problems in pregnant animals, and this also should
be considered for other alphaz agonists. Use cautiously in animals that are
 pregnant because it may induce labor. In addition, it may decrease oxygen
skin, and from eye and mouth contact in humans. If there is accidental exposure,
immediately rinse with soap and water. Contact a physician if there are other
concerns.
Drug Interactions
Other drugs that depress the heart may increase risk for arrhythmias.
Instructions for Use
It is used primarily for horses, and although not approved for small animals, dosages
are listed below. Atropine (0.0l to 0.02 mg/kg) has been used to prevent
bradycardia but is not necessary for routine use. It may be administered with other
anesthetics, analgesics, sedatives including butorphanol, and benzodiazepines.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor heart rate and, if possible, the ECG during treatment with this class of
drugs. If available, blood pressure monitoring may be indicated in some patients.

Trade and other names: Azium solution in polyethylene glycol, Dexaject,
Dex-A-Vet, Decadron, Dexasone, Voren suspension, and generic brands
Functional classification: Corticosteroid
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Corticosteroid. Anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of dexamethasone
are approximately 30 times more potent than cortisol. Anti-inflammatory effects
are complex but primarily via inhibition of inflammatory cells and suppression of
expression of inflammatory mediators. Use is for treatment of inflammatory and
immune-mediated disease. This dexamethasone solution differs from dexamethasone
appropriate for intravenous administration. Dexamethasone solution is in a
Dexamethasone-2l-isonicotinate is a suspension registered for IM use.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Dexamethasone is used for treatment of inflammatory and immune-mediated
disease. The use of dexamethasone at high doses for treatment of shock is
controversial. Most recent evidence does not support administration of
dexamethasone for this use. Dexamethasone is also used as a diagnostic test of
adrenal function. Large animal uses include induction of parturition (cattle) and
treatment of inflammatory conditions. In cattle, corticosteroids also have been used
in the treatment of ketosis. In horses, dexamethasone has been used to treat
recurrent airway obstruction (RAO).
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Side effects from corticosteroids are many and include polyphagia, polydipsia/
polyuria, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression. Adverse
effects include GI ulceration, hepatopathy, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, decreased
thyroid hormone, decreased protein synthesis, delayed wound healing, and
208Dexamethasone
immunosuppression. Secondary infections can occur as a result of
immunosuppression and include infections from Demodex, toxoplasmosis,
fungal infections, and UTIs. High-dose glucocorticoids in animals with
neurologic disease can lead to excitotoxic cell death and oxidative injury via
increased excitatory amino acids. In horses, dexamethasone adverse effects include
nisk of laminitis, although this effect is controversial and not supported by strong
evidence.
Contraindications and Precautions
Use cautiously in patients prone to ulcers or infection or in animals in which
wound healing is necessary. Use cautiously in animals with diabetes or renal
failure and in pregnant animals. Intravenous injections should be done slowly
because formulations contain polyethylene glycol, which can cause reactions from
rapid intravenous injection (hemolysis, hypotension, and collapse). Do not
administer dexamethasone-2l-isonicotinate IV (IM use only).
Drug Interactions
Administration of corticosteroids with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) will increase the risk of GI injury. pH is 7-8.5. Do not mix with

Dexmedetomidine Hydrochloride
dex-meh-deh-toe'mih-deen hye-droe-kloride
Trade and other names: Dexdomitor
Functional classification: Analgesic, alpha2 agonist
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Alpha2-adrenergic agonist. Alpha2 agonists decrease release of neurotransmitters from
the neuron. Dexmedetomidine and medetomidine (Domitor) are very similar in
activity. Medetomidine is a racemic mixture containing 50% dexmedetomidine 50%
levomedetomidine. Dexmedetomidine is the active enantiomer of the mixture
(D-isomer); therefore (on a mg/mg basis) dexmetomidine is twice the potency of
and sedative effects. The proposed mechanism whereby they decrease transmission is
via binding to presynaptic alphaz receptors (negative feedback receptors). The result
is decreased sympathetic outflow, analgesia, sedation, and anesthesia. Other drugs in
this class include medetomidine, xylazine, detomidine, romifidine, and clonidine.
Receptor-binding studies indicate that alpha2/alphaj-adrenergic receptor selectivity is
more than loo0 times that of xylazine.
212Dexmedetomidine Hydrochloride
Indications and Clinical Uses
 Dexmedetomidine, like other alpha2 agonists, is used as a sedative, anesthetic
adjunct, and analgesia. It is approved for use in both dogs and cats. It can be
administered to facilitate examinations, diagnostic procedures, treatments, ear and
teeth cleaning, and minor surgery. It has been used to sedate animals for intradermal
skin testing without affecting results. In cats the peak effects are observed in l5-60
minutes, and the recovery occurs by l80 minutes. It has similar clinical effects as
medetomidine and can be used for similar indications. It can be administered in
combination with ketamine, butorphanol, or opiate agonists for sedation and
short-term surgical procedures (see Instructions for Use). Dexmedetomidine is well
absorbed across membranes and has produced similar effects in cats after oral
transmucosal (buccal) administration compared to IM injection
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
In small animals, vomiting is the most common acute effect. Vomiting is more
common in cats than dogs. Alpha2 agonists decrease sympathetic output.
Cardiovascular depression may occur. Like medetomidine, dexmedetomidine
can produce an initial bradycardia and hypertension. An initial increase in blood
pressure may be followed by a decrease in blood pressure caused by decreased
sympathetic tone. Lower respiratory rate and body temperature occur in animals
during dexmedetomidine sedation. Transient arrhythmias may occur in some
animals. Paradoxical excitement may occur in some animals, and animals with
high anxiety levels may not respond predictably to alphaz agonists. If adverse
reactions are observed, reverse with atipamezole (Antisedan). Yohimbine also can
reverse medetomidine.
Contraindications and Precautions
 Use cautiously in animals with heart disease. Use may be contraindicated in
older animals with preexisting cardiac disease. Use cautiously in animals with
respiratory, liver, or kidney disease. Do not use in animals with signs of shock.
Xylazine causes problems in pregnant animals, and this also should be considered
for other alphaz agonists. Use cautiously in animals that are pregnant because it
may induce labor. In addition, it may decrease oxygen delivery to fetus in late
gestation. Dexmedetomidine can be absorbed through intact human skin;
therefore, avoid human exposure.
Drug Interactions
 Do not use with other drugs that may cause cardiac depression. Do not mix in
vial or syringe with other anesthetics. Reverse with atipamezole at a dose of
25-300 mcg/kg IM. Use with opioid analgesic drugs will greatly enhance
the CNS depression. Consider lowering doses if administered with opioids.
Anticholinergic drugs (e.g., atropine) may be given in moderate doses prior to
drug administration to prevent bradycardia induced by alpha2 agonists, but it is
not routinely needed and may prolong initial hypertension. However,
administration smnitaneonsly with alphaz agonists is not recommended.
Instructions for Use
Dexmedetomidine, medetomidine, and detomidine are more specific for the
alphaz receptor than xylazine. They may be used for sedation, analgesia, and minor
surgical procedures. It is recommended to withhold food for several hours prior to
Dexmedetomidine Hydrochloride  213
administration of alphaz agonists to minimize vomiting. Lower doses are often
administered for cases when less sedation is needed or when combined with other
drugs. Dexmedetomidine can be used with other anesthetics such as propofol,
thiopental, opiates, benzodiazepines, and inhalent gas anesthetics. However, lower
doses (as much as 40%-60%) of other drugs are anticipated when used with
dexmedetomidine. When administered at a dose of 10 mcg/kg to cats, in
combination with butorphanol or ketamine there was adequate sedation without
significant cardiovascular effects. In dogs and cats, reverse with atipamezole at a dose
of 25-300 mcg/kg (equal to volume of dexmedetomidine used) IM.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor vital signs during anesthesia. Monitor heart rate, blood pressure, and ECG
during anesthesia. Alpha2 agonists will increase blood glucose because of effects on
insulin secretion.
Formulations
Dexmedetomidine is available in vials containing 0.5 mg/mL injection.
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature.
Stability of compounded formulations has not been evaluated.

surgical procedures (IV dose range is 28 mcg/kg for small dogs to 9 mcg/kg
for large dogs; IM dose range is 40 mcg/kg for small dogs to 12 mcg/kg for
large dogs).
· Lower doses are used for short-term sedation and analgesia or when combined
with other analgesic or anesthetic agents.
Cats
·40 mcg/kg (0.04 mg/kg) IM (0.35 mL for 4 kg cat). Oral transmucosal

214 Dextran
Dextran
deks'tran 
Trade and other names: Dextran 70 and Gentran-70
Functional classification: Fluid replacement
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
 Synthetic colloid used for volume expansion. Dextrans are glucose polymers and are
available as low molecular weight (Dextran 40) and high molecular weight (Dextran
70). Dextran 70 is the most often used. The colloids such as dextrans are large-
molecular-weight molecules that remain in the vasculature because of their large
size. Therefore, they increase colloid osmotic pressure within the vasculature to
prevent intravascular fluid loss and inhibit tissue edema. Other colloids used are
hetastarch and pentastarch.
Indications and Clinical Uses
 Dextran is a high-molecular-weight compound administered IV to maintain
intravascular volume. It is used for acute treatment of hypovolemia and shock.
Duration of effect is approximately 24 hours.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
There is only limited use in veterinary medicine, and adverse effects have not
been reported. In people, coagulopathies are possible because of decreased
platelet finction and antithrombotic effects. Acute renal failure has occurred, and
anaphylactic shock also has occurred in people.
Contraindications and Precautions
 Do not use in animals that are prone to bleeding problems. Dextrans can
interfere with cross-matching of blood for transfusion. Cats are more susceptible
to fluid overload than dogs, and lower doses must be used in cats.
Drug Interactions
Compatible with most intravenous fluid solutions, including 0.9% saline solution
and 5% dextrose solution.
Instructions for Use
Used primarily in critical care situations. Delivered slowly via constant rate infusion
(60-90 minutes). In emergency use, bolus doses of 20 mL/kg can be administered
more rapidly.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor patient's cardiopulmonary status carefully during administration. Dextrans
can interfere with cross-matching of blood

Dextromethorphan
deks-troe-meth-or'fan
Trade and other names: Benylin and others
Functional classification: Antitussive
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Centrally acting antitussive drug. Dextromethorphan shares similar chemical
structure to opiates but does not affect opiate receptors and appears to directly affect
cough receptor. Dextromethorphan is the d-isomer of levorphan (the l-isomer,
levorphan, is an opiate with addictive properties, but the d-isomer does not).
Dextromethorphan produces mild analgesia and modulates pain via its ability to
aCt as an n-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, but this is unrelated to the
antitussive action.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Dextromethorphan has been used for suppression of nonproductive cough.
However, its efficacy for reducing cough has been questioned because of a lack
of proof. Dextromethorphan also has been used as an adjunct for treating pain
because of NMDA antagonism. Pharmacokinetic studies in dogs indicated that
dextromethorphan does not attain effective concentrations after oral administration.
Even after intravenous administration, concentrations of the parent drug and active
metabolite persisted for only a short time after dosing. Therefore, routine use in
dogs is not recommended until more data are available to establish safe and effective
doses. Data have not been reported for the pharmacokinetics in cats or any other
species.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects not reported in veterinary medicine. High overdose may cause
sdation. After administration to dogs, dextromethorphan produced adverse
effects seen as vomiting after oral doses and CNS reactions after intravenous
216   Dextromethorphan
administration. Some preparations contain alcohol, which can be unpalatable in
small animals, especially cats.
Contraindications and Precautions
There are no contraindications identified for animals. However, pet owners
should be cautioned that many OTC preparations contain other drugs that may
produce significant side effects. For example, some combinations also contain
acetaminophen, which can be toxic to cats. Some preparations also contain a
decongestant, such as pseudoephedrine, which can cause excitement and other
side effects.
Drug Interactions
There are no direct interactions identified for dogs. However, interactions are
possible when used with other drugs that may interfere with cytochrome P-450
metabolism.
Instructions for Use
Many OTC preparations may contain other ingredients (e.g., antihistamines,
decongestants, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen). Adverse effects from each of these
ingredients, such as toxic reactions caused by acetaminophen, CNS excitement from
decongestants, and GI toxicity from ibuprofen, can occur in animals.

Dextrose is a sugar added to fluid solutions. It is isotonic as delivered. Five percent
dextrose contains 50 g of dextrose per liter. The pH of this solution is 3.5-6.5.
Alternatively, 50% dextrose solution can be added to intravenous fluids to
supplement dextrose. For example, 100 mL of 50% dextrose added to 1000 mL
supplies 5% dextrose.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Five percent dextrose is an isotonic fluid solution used for intravenous
administration. Dextrose is considered only for short-term use because it is deficient
in electrolytes. After the glucose is metabolized, the water is rapidly distributed out

Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
High doses can produce pulmonary edema
Contraindications and Precautions
Use cautiously in animals with low electrolyte concentrations. Five percent
dextrose solution is not a suitable maintenance solution because it does not
provide electrolytes. It should not be considered as a replacement solution or a
treatment is used with 50% dextrose, it may cause rapid decrease in plasma
phosphorous and potassium (intracellular shift).
Drug Interactions
 No interactions. Five percent dextrose solution is compatible with fluids and
most intravenous drugs.
Instructions for Use
Dextrose is a commonly used fluid solution administered via constant rate infusion.
However, it is not a maintenance solution. Dextrose 50% solution can also be added
to fluids to supply dextrose. For example, 50 mL of 50% dextrose is added to
1000 mL fluids to achieve a final 2.5% solution.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor patient's hydration status and evidence of pulmonary edema during
infusion. Monitor acid-base status.
Formulations
Fluid solution for intravenous administration is 5% dextrose, which contains 5 g of
glucose per 100 mL (50 g/L). 50% dextrose contains 500 mg/mL (50 g/100 mL).

Regulatory Information
Withdrawal times are not established. However, this drug presents little risk from
residues; therefore, no withdrawal time is suggested for animals intended for food.
Diazepam
dye-ay' zeh-pa.m
Trade and other names: Valium and generic brands
Functional classification: Anticonvulsant
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Benzodiazepine. Central acting CNS depressant. Mechanism of action appears to be
via potentiation of GABA-receptor-mediated effects in CNS because it binds to the
GABA binding site. Diazepam is metabolized to desmethyldiazepam (nordiazepam)
and oxazepam. These metabolites also have some centrally acting benzodiazepine
effects. In dogs, the intravenous half-life of diazepam is short (<l hour), but active
metabolites are produced. In cats, the intravenous half life is approximately 5 hours.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Diazepam is used for sedation, anesthetic adjunct, anticonvulsant, and behavioral
disorders. Although it is used as a muscle relaxant, its effcacy for this use is not
established. In cats, diazepam has been administered IV for short-term stimulation
of appetite. In cats, oral administration has been effective for decreasing urine
praying, but relapses are common when the drug is discontinued. Diazepam is
usually administered orally or IV. However, it has been shown to be absorbed
absorption from nasal spray in dogs).
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Sedation is the most common side effect. In dogs, ataxia and increased appetite
can be observed. Diazepam may cause paradoxical excitement and agitiation in
dogs. In cats, idiopathic fatal hepatic necrosis has been reported. Chronic
administration may lead to dependence and a withdrawal syndrome if
Diazepam  219
discontinued. Administration IM or SQ can be painful and irritating. Intravenous
injection can cause phlebitis.
Contraindications and Precautions
Diazepam is highly dependent on liver blood flow for metabolism. Do not
be avoided because of risk of liver toxicity. Its use for ivermectin-induced CNS
intoxication is controversial.
Drug Interactions
Diazepam is highly lipophilic and will bind to (adsorb) soft plastic containers,
infusion, sets, and fluid bags. Storage of diazepam in such containers is not
recommended. Diazepam is not soluble in aqueous solutions. Admixing with
aqueous solutions or fluids can result in precipitation.
Instructions for Use
Clearance in dogs is many times faster than in people (half-life in dogs less than
1 hour), requiring frequent administration. For treatment of status epilepticus,
diazepam may be administered IV, intranasal, or rectally. Avoid IM administration
because of pain from injection and unpredictable absorption.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Plasma concentrations in the range of l00-250 ng/mL have been cited as the
therapeutic range for people. Other references have cited this range as l50 to
300 ng/mL. Although plasma or serum may be analyzed for concentrations of
benzodiazepines, there are no readily available tests for monitoring in many
veterinary laboratories. Laboratories that analyze human samples may have
nonspecific tests for benzodiazepines. With these assays, there may be cross-reactivity
among diazepam and the metabolites desmethyldiazepam and oxazepam.
Formulations
 Diazepam is available in 2-, 5-, and 10-mg tablets and 5 mg/mL solution for
injection.
Stability and Storage
Do not store in soft plastic (PVC) containers or fluid bags. Significant adsorption
occurs to soft plastic. However, it is compatible with hard plastic, such as syringes.
Do not expose to light. Compounded fommulations, especially those prepared for
but is soluble in alcohol and propylene glycol. Diazepam undergoes hydrolysis in
water. Diazepam prepared as an oral suspension (l mg/mL) in various vehicles (pH
4.2) was stable for 60 days.

Dichlorphenamide
dye-klor-fen'ah-mide
Trade and other names: Daranide
Functional classification: Diuretic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Diuretic. Dichlorphenamide, like other carbonic
anhydrase inhibitors, produces a diuresis by inhibiting the reabsorption of
bicarbonate in proximal renal tubules via enzyme inhibition. This action results in
loss of bicarbonate in the urine and a diuresis. The action of carbonic anhydrase
inhibitors results in significant urine loss of bicarbonate, alkaline urine, and
water loss.
Indications and Clinical Uses
and effective diuretic drugs available such as the loop diuretics (furosemide).
Dichlorphenamide, like other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, is used primarily to
reduce intraocular pressure in animals with glaucoma. Methazolamide is used
more often than dichlorphenamide or acetazolamide for this purpose, and other
treatment regimens are used more often than carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.
Dichlorphenamide, like other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, is sometimes used to
produce a more alkaline urine for management of some urinary calculi.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
With prolonged use it will deplete bicarbonate if not replenished. Sulfonamide

Diclazuril
dih-klaz'yoor-il
Trade and other names: Clincox
Functional classification: Antiprotozoal
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Coccidiostat. Diclazuril is a triazinone antiprotozoal that is effective for treating
infections caused by Isospora spp., Toxoplasmn gondii, and Eimerin spp. and has
been used for treating coccidiosis. It also has been used in horses to treat equine
protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM) caused by Sarcocytis newrona. Toltrazuril
sulfone (ponazuril) is an active metabolite found in serum and cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) of treated horses. Because of the availability of a commercial formulation of

Dicloxacillin Sodium
dye-kloks-ah-sill'in soe'dee-um
Trade and other names: Dynapen and generic
Functional classification: Antibacterial
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Dicloxacillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic—a semisynthetic derivative of penicillin. It
resembles ampicillin in activity except it has greater stability against staphylococcal
beta-lactamase. Like other antibiotics in this class, it inhibits bacterial cell wall
synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins and weakening the cell wall. The
spectrum is limited to gram-positive bacteria, especially staphylococci.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Dicloxacin has a relatively narrow spectrum of activity. Like cloxacillin and oxacillin,
the spectrum of dicloxacillin includes gram-positive bacilli, including beta-lactamase-
producing strains of Staphylococcns. Therefore, it has been used to treat
staphylococcal infections in animals, including pyoderma. It is not active against
methicillin-resistant Stapbylococcws. Because of availability of other drugs for small
Because it is an oral drug with limited absorption in large animals, its use is limited
to small animal oral administration.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects of penicillin drugs are most commonly caused by drug allergy.

allergic reaction when other routes are used. When administered orally (especially
with high doses), diarrhea is possible.
Contraindications and Precautions
Use cautiously in animals allergic to penicillin-like drugs.
Drug Interactions
There are no specific drug interactions. Dicloxacillin is absorbed better on an
D
empty stomach in dogs.
Instructions for Use
No clinical effcacy studies available for dogs or cats. In dogs, oral absorption is
low and may not be suitable for therapy. Administer if possible on an empty
stomach.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
 Use oxacillin as a guide for sensitivity testing. Break points for oxacillin apply to
dicloxacillin.
Formulations
Dicloxaillin is available in 125-, 250-, and 500-mg capsules and 12.5-mg/mL oral
suspension.
Stability and Storage

Diethylcarbamazine Citrate
dye-eth-il-kar-bam'eh-zeen sih'trate 
Trade and other names: Caricide, Filaribits, and Nemacide
Functional classification: Antiparasitic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Heartworm preventative and anthelmintic. Produces neuromuscular blockade in
parasite through inhibition of neurotransmitter that causes paralysis of worms.
226 Diethylcarbamazine Citrate
Indications and Clinical Uses
Caricide tablets and some other brands used for heartworm prevention have
been voluntarily withdrawn from the sponsor. Because of the availability of other
heartworm preventatives, the use of diethylcarbamazine has diminished significantly.
Diethylcarbamazine has been used to prevent infection caused by heartwomms in
dogs. It is administered regularly during heartworm season in endemic areas. It
is not effective to treat heartworms once infection is established. Other uses of
diethylcarbamazine include control of ascarids infections ( Toxocarn canis and
Toxascaris leonina) and as an aid in treatment of ascanid infections at higher doses
(55 to ll0 mg/kg). In cats, dethylcarbamazine has been used to treat ascarid worm
infections (55-110 mg/kg).
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Overdoses cause vomiting. If administered to an animal with positive microfilaria.
reactions, including pulmonary reactions, are possible. This drug is a piperazine
derivative, which is a class of antiparasitic drugs considered generally safe in
animals.
Contraindications and Precautions
Dogs with established heartworm infections caused by Dirofilarin im mitis should
not receive diethylcarbamazine until they have been treated with an adulticide
to kill the adult heartworms followed by appropriate microflaricidal treatment.
Reactions can occur in animals with positive microflaria. However, there are no
breed sensitivities or other specific contraindications.
Drug Interactions
No specific drug interactions are reported
Instructions for Use
Specific protocols for heartworm administration may be based on the region of
country because the time (season) required for heartworm prevention depends on
the duration of active mosquitoes during the year. Although diethylcarbamazine is
effective to prevent heartworms, it requires almost continual daily treatment for
efficacy. Two or three doses should not be missed. Occasionally some animals vomit
immediately after dosing. Administration with food sometimes decreases this
lactones (ivermectin and related drugs).
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor heartworm status of patient. It is important to test for microfilaria in
animals before prescribing. Manufacturers recommend that animals that are currently
receiving diethylcarbamazine be checked for microfilaria every 6 months. Reactions
can occur in animals with positive microflaria.
Formulations
Although some brands have been withdrawn by the sponsor, some availability of
other diethylcarbamazine tablets may vary with manufacturer and brand name. Not
every brand name is available in the sizes listed. Both plain and chewable tablets

Diethylstilbestrol
dye-eth-il-stil-bess'trole
Trade and other names: DES and generic brands
Functional classification: Hormone
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Diethylstilbestrol, known as DES, is a synthetic drug with estrogen effects. It differs
from steroid compounds because it does not have a steroid ring. It is used for
estrogen replacement in animals. When used to treat urinary incontinence, the
action of DES is believed to increase sensitivity of alpha receptors in the urinary
sphincter to restore continence.
Indications and Clinical Uses
 DES is most commonly used to treat estrogen-responsive incontinence in dogs.
Phenylpropanolamine (PPA) has been used in dogs when DES therapy is no longer
effective. Conjugated estrogens (e.g., Premarin at 20 mcg/kg twice weekly) have
been used in some dogs when DES is unavailable. Estriol also has been used in
some dogs to treat incontinence. DES also has been used to induce abortion in
dogs. Commercial foms of DES are no longer available, but it is available through
some compounding pharmacies.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Side effects may occur that are caused by excess estrogen. Estrogen therapy may
increase risk of pyometra and estrogen-sensitive tumors. Although bone marrow
depression (particularly anemia) has been reported from administration of other
228  Diethylstilbestrol
of DES therapy.
Contraindications and Precautions
 DES has been associated with development of cancer, and human exposure
should be minimized as much as possible (the use is prohibited in food animals).
Although not reported as a significant clinical problem with DES, problems with
anemia have occurred with administration of high doses of estrogens to animals.
Drug Interactions
No significant drug interactions have been reported for animals. However, in
people, administration of estrogens increases thyroid-binding globulin and may
decrease the active form of thyroid hormone (T4) in patients receiving thyroid
supplementation.
Instructions for Use
Titrate dose to individual patient's response. Although used to induce abortion, it
was not efficacious in one study that administered 75 mcg/kg.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor CBC to detect signs of bone marrow toxicity. Monitor T4 levels if patients
are hypothyroid and receiving supplementation.
Formulations
DES has been available in l- and 5-mg tablets and 50-mg/mL injection. DES is no
longer marketed commercially in the US, but it is available from compounding
pharmacists.
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature.
Stability of compounded formulations has not been reported. However,
compounded tablets are available from compounding pharmacies, and anecdotal
information indicates that they are effective.

Difloxacin Hydrochloride229
Difloxacin Hydrochloride
dye-floks'ah-sin hye-droe-klor'ide
Trade and other names: Dicural
Functional classification: Antibacterial
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
1
Fluoroquinolone antibacterial drug. Acts via inhibition of DNA gyrase in bactenria
to inhibit DNA and RNA synthesis. Bactericidal with broad spectrum of activity.
Antibacterial activity includes Escherichin coli, Klebsiella spp., Pasteurella spp., and
other gram-negative bacilli. Activity against Psendomonas neruginosn is less than
for other gram-negative bacilli. Activity against gram-positive cocci includes
Staphylococcns. Streptococcns and Enterococcns are more resistant. In horses, it has an
oral half-life of 10.8 hours and bioavailability of 68%.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Difloxacin, like other fluoroquinolones, is used for a variety of infections including
skin infections, wound infections, and pneumonia. Unlike other fluoroquinolones,
difloxacin does not have high renal clearance. Urine concentrations may not be
sufficient for some UTIs.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
High concentrations may cause CNS toxicity, especially in animals with renal
filure. Difloxacin may cause some nausea, vomiting, and diarhea at high doses.
All of the fuoroquinolones may cause arthropathy in young animals. Dogs are
most sensitive at 4 weeks to 28 weeks of age. Large, rapidly growing dogs are
the most susceptible. Safety in cats has not been reported. It has not been
reported if there is a potential to cause retinal ocular injury in cats.
Contraindications and Precautions
Avoid use in young animals because of risk of cartilage injury. Use cautiously in
animals that may be prone to seizures, such as epileptics. Avoid use in cats unless
safety has been established.
Drug Interactions
Fluoroquinolones may increase concentrations of theophylline if used
concurrently. Coadministration with divalent and trivalent cations, such as
products containing aluminum (e.g., sucralfate), iron, or calcium, may decrease
absorption. Do not mix in solutions or in vials with aluminum, calcium, iron, or
zinc because chelation may occur.
Instructions for Use
 Dose range can be used to adjust dose depending on severity of infection and
susceptibility of bacteria. Bacteria with low minimum inhibitory concentration
(MIC) values can be treated with a low dose; susceptible bacteria with higher MIC
values should be treated with a higher dose. Difloxacin is pnimarily eliminated in
feces rather than urine (urine is less than 5% of clearance). Sarafloxacin is an active
desmethyl metabolite but produced in low amounts. Oral absorption in horses is
low and should only be used for bacteria with MIC less than 0.l2 mcg/mL.
230 Digitoxin
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Susceptibility testing: CLSI break points for sensitive organisms is ≤0.5 mcg/mL for
canine pathogens. Other fluoroquinolones may be used in some cases to estimate
susceptibility to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, ciprofloxacin may be several times more
active than other fluoroquinolones.
Formulations
Difloxacin is available in 1l.4-, 45.4-, and 136-mg tablets. {In some countries, 5%
injectable is available.)

Digitoxin
dih-jih-toks'in
Trade and other names: Digimerck (European)
Functional classification: Cardiac inotropic agent
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Cardiac inotropic agent. Digitoxin increases cardiac contractility and decreases heart
rate. The mechanism is via inactivation of cardiac muscle sodium-potassium ATPase
and increased intracellular accumulation of calcium, triggering calcium release from
the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In addition, neuroendocrine effects include sensitization
of baroreceptors, which decreases heart rate. Beneficial effects for heart failure may
be via these neuroendocrine effects.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Digitoxin is indicated in patients with myocardial failure and to control the rate of
supraventricular tachycardias. Digitoxin formulation availability for treating patients
is limited. Digitoxin is no longer be obtained in the US. Subsequently, most of the
digitoxin use has been replaced by digoxin. Digoxin is an active metabolite of
digitoxin and may be used instead of digitoxin.
Digoxin  231
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Digitalis glycosides have narrow therapeutic index. Digitoxin may cause a variety
 of arrhythmias in patients (e.g., AV block and ventricular tachycardia). It
 frequently causes vomiting, anorexia, and diarrhea. Digitoxin has adverse effects
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not administer to animals with AV block or at risk for other serious
arrhythmias. Do not administer to animals with potassium electrolyte
abnormalities.
Drug Interactions
High potassium will diminish clinical effect; low potassium will enhance effect
 and toxicity. Quinidine may increase plasma concentrations. Calcium-channel
blocking drugs and beta blockers may potentiate action on AV node conduction.
Instructions for Use
Use of digitoxin has diminished in recent years in favor of digoxin. If available, it
may be used with other cardiac drugs.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor serum digoxin concentrations in patients to determine optimum therapy.
When monitoring, collect blood samples 2-6 hours after dosing. The therapeutic
range is 10-30 ng/mL.
Formulations
Digitoxin was once available in 0.05- and 0.l-mg tablets. (It is no longer available

Digoxin
dih-joks'in 
Trade and other names: Lanoxin and Cardoxin
Functional classification: Cardiac inotropic agent
232Digoxin
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Cardiac inotropic agent. Digoxin increases cardiac contractility and decreases heart
rate. The mechanism is via inactivation of cardiac muscle sodium-potassium ATPase
and increased intracellular availability of calcium, triggering calcium release from
sarcoplasmic reticulum. In addition, neuroendocrine effects include sensitization of
baroreceptors, which decreases heart rate by increasing vagal tone. Beneficial effects
cardiac effects may be caused by decreased heart rate and suppression of the AV
node to inhibit re-entrant cardiac arrhythmias via these neuroendocrine effects.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Digoxin is used in heart failure for inotropic effect and decreased heart rate in dogs,
cats, and occasionally other animals. It is used in supraventricular arrhythmias to
decrease ventricular response to atrial stimulation via suppresson of the AV node.
converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (e.g., enalapril), diuretics (furosemide), and
vasodilators.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Digitalis glycosides such as digoxin have a narrow therapeutic index. They may
cause a variety of arrhythmias in patients (e.g., AV and ventricular tachycardia)
and may produce delayed after depolarization-induced arrhythmias. Digoxin
frequently causes vomiting, anorexia, and diarrhea. Digoxin adverse effects are
potentiated by hypokalemia and reduced by hyperkalemia.
Contraindications and Precautions
Some breeds of dogs (Doberman pinscher) and cats are more sensitive to adverse
effects.
Drug Interactions
High potassium will diminish clinical effect; low potassium will enhance effect

capable of increasing digoxin concentrations, including quinidine, aspirin,
clarithromycin (and other macrolides), and chloramphenicol (see Appendix for
may decrease digoxin concentrations by increasing clearance. Calcium-channel
blockers and beta blockers will potentiate action on AV node conduction,
increasing the risk of AV block. Digoxin is absorbed better in an acid stomach,
and proton pump inhibitors or H blockers may reduce oral absorption.
Instructions for Use
When dosing, calculate dose on lean body weight. Doses should be 10% less for
elixir because of increased absorption. When used to treat atril fibrillation in dogs,
combined with diltiazem, it may produce greater reduction in ventricular rate than
cither drug alone.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor patients carefully. Monitor serum digoxin concentrations in patients to
dose. Some cardiologists recommend concentrations of 0.9-1.0 ng/mL and below
for treating heart failure and to reduce heart rate to l40-l60 bpm. Adverse effects
are common at concentration above 3.5 ng/mL, but in some sensitive patients, this

Diltiazem Hydrochloride 235
vasodilation, negative chronotropic effects, and negative inotropic effects. However,
the action on cardiac tissue (SA node and AV node) predominates over other
effects. Half-life in dogs is approximately 3 hours (range 2.5-4 hrs), and it is shorter
in horses (1.5 hrs).
Indications and Clinical Uses
 Diltiazem is used primarily for control of supraventricular arrhythmias, systemic
?
AV nodal re-entry arrhythmias, and other foms of tachycardia. Diltiazem is more
effective on heart tissues (AV node and SA node) than on blood vessels. It should
not be used as a primary treatment of hypertension and to produce vasodilation;
one of the dihydropyridines calcium-channel blocking drugs (e.g., amlodipine) is
preferred. In cats it is considered one of the drugs of choice for treatment of
feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). In dogs, diltiazem has been used to
treat acute renal failure. It may improve renal perfusion by decreasing renal
for atrial fibrillation. However, treated horses had variable results, and some
developed hypotension and sinus arrest. Transdermal administration of diltiazem has
not been shown to be effective in cats.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Hypotension, myocardial depression, bradycardia, and AV block are the most
important adverse effects. If acute hypotension occurs, treat with aggressive fluid
therapy and administration of calcium gluconate or calcium chloride. It may
When cats were administered 60 mg of Dilacor XR it produced lethargy, GI
disturbances, and weight loss in 36% of cats.
Contraindications and Precautions
hypotension.
Drug Interactions
Calcium-channel blocking drugs have been associated with drug interactions in
people by interfering with drug metabolism. These interactions have not been
documented in veterinary patients but are possible because of similar mechanisms.
Therefore, use with caution when administering other drugs that may be
P-glycoprotein (efflux protein produced by MDR gene) substrates. (See
 Appendix.) Do not mix intravenous solutions with furosemide.
Instructions for Use
 Diltiazem is preferred over verapamil in patients with heart failure because of less
myocardial depression. When used to treat atril fibrillation in dogs, combined with
digoxin it may produce greater reduction in ventricular rate than either drug alone
See detailed instructions for cats in Small Animal Dosage section.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor heart rate and rhythm during treatment. Monitor blood pressure with acute
treatment for atrial fbrillation. If blood concentrations are monitored, to produce a
reduction in heart rate 80-290 ng/mL are necessary in people and 60-120 ng/mL
in dogs.

Dimenhydrinate
dye-men-hye'drih-nate
Trade and other names: Dramamine (Gravol in Canada)
Functional classification: Antihistamine
D
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antihistamine (Hj-blocker). Diphenhydramine is the active moiety of
dimenhydrinate.
Similar to other antihistamines, it acts by blocking the H receptor and suppresses
inflammatory reactions caused by histamine. The H, blockers have been used to
control pruritus and skin inflammation in dogs and cats; however, success rates
in dogs have not been high. Commonly used antihistamines include clemastine,
chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine, and hydroxyzine. Dimenhydrinate is converted
to active diphenhydramine. Dimenhydrinate also has central-acting antiemetic
properties, possibly by acting on the vomiting center or via the chemoreceptor-
migger zone (CRTZ).
Indications and Clinical Uses
addition to the antihistamine effect for treating allergies, dimenhydrinate, like other
antihistamines, acts as an antiemetic via the drug effects on the centers that control
vomiting in animals. Antihistamines used as antiemetics are administered for motion
sickness, vomiting induced by chemotherapy, and GI disease that stimulates
vomiting
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Sedation is the most common side effect. Sedation is the result of inhibition of
histamine N-methyltransferase. Sedation may also be attributed to the block of
other CNS receptors such as those for serotonin, acetylcholine, and alpha-
receptors. Antimuscarinic effects (atropine-like effects) also are common,
including dry mouth and decreased GI secretions.
Contraindications and Precautions
Antimuscarinic effects (atropine-like effects) are common. Do not use in
conditions for which anticholinergic drugs may be contraindicated, such as
glaucoma, ileus, or cardiac arrhythmias.
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions are reported. However, use with other sedatives and
tranquilizers may increase sedation.
Instructions for Use
Like other antihistamines, there have been no clinical studies on the use of
dimenhydrinate. It is primarily used empirically for treatment of vomiting and to
prevent allergic reactions.

Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO)
di-meth-il sulf-oks^ide
Trade and other names: DMSO and Domoso
Functional classification: Anti-inflammatory
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
 DMSO is a solvent that is a byproduct of the paper-making process. It is highly
hygroscopic (water absorbing). It readily displaces water and will penetrate cell
membranes, skin, and mucosa easily. It produces anti-inflammatory, antifungal, and
antibacterial properties. The clinical anti-inflammatory action of DMSO is uncertain.
It may produce anti-inflammatory or protective effects on cell membranes via its
ability to scavenge oxygen-derived free radicals. In horses, at a dose of l g/kg, the
half-life is 8.6 hours. Twenty-six percent of the administered dose was excreted in
the urine. In dogs, the half-life is 36 hours.
Indications and clinical Uses
DMSO is administered topically and systemically (IV) for treatment of various
inflammatory conditions. It is popular in horses for treatment of laminitis, arthritis,
pneumonia, intestinal ischemia, synovitis, and nervous system injuries. Despite
popular use, there are no published reports of effcacy for clinical use, and evidence
to support use as an anti-inflammatory agent in treatment of clinical disease is

neurologic disease. It does not promote drug penetration across the blood-brain
barrier.
240 Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO)
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
DMSO is irritating to skin and mucosal membranes. It is hygroscopic and also
 induces release of histamine in skin. Long-term use has produced ocular lens
changes in laboratory animals. Concentrated DMSO, when administered IV,
will cause significant hemolysis. Intravenous use also has been associated with
hemoglobinemia, acute colic, diarrhea, myositis, muscle tremors, and collapse.
These reactions are more likely at doses of 2 g/kg or greater. DMSO produces a
strong odor when administered.
Contraindications and Precautions
Although many veterinarians administer it systemically, DMSO is not approved
for this use. It may enhance transdermal absorption of toxicants and
contaminants on the skin. Do not administer IV at concentrations >l0% or at
doses >l g/kg. Do not administer concentrated solution systemically.
Drug Interactions
 DMSO is a strong solvent. It will dissolve other compounds. It may act as a
penetration enhancer and increase transmembrane penetration of other
compounds.
Instructions for Use
Dilute prior to use to l0% for intravenous infusion. Doses vary widely among
veterinarians. Dose listed of l g/kg is common, but ranges of 0.2 to 4 g/kg have
been cited in the literature for horses.

Dinoprost Tromethamine  241
Dinoprost Tromethamine
dye'noe-prahst troe-meth'ah-meen
Trade and other names: Lutalyse, Prostin F2 alpha, ProstaMate, Prostaglandin
F2 alpha, and PGF2 alpha
Functional classification: Prostaglandin
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Dinoprost is a prostaglandin (PGF, alpha) that induces luteolysis. Prostaglandin F2
and its analogs have a direct luteolytic action on the corpus leuteum. After injection,
it will produce a functional regression of the corpus luteum (Luteolysis). In
nonpregnant cycling cattle, this effect will result in starting estrus 2 to 5 days after
injection. In pregnant animals, it will terminate pregnancy. In animals with
prolonged luteal activity that have pyometra, mummified fetus, or luteal cysts,
the luteolysis usually results in resolution of the problem and return to normal
cycling.
Indications and Clinical Uses
 Dinoprost is used for estrus synchronization in cattle and horses by causing
luteolysis. In horses and cattle it is used to control timing of estrus in estrus-cycling
females and in clinically anestrus females that have a corpus luteum. In pigs,
dinoprost is used to induce parturition when given within 3 days of farrowing. In
dogs, dinoprost has been used to treat open pyometra. In cattle, dinoprost has been
used for treatment of chronic endometnitis.
In large animals, dinoprost is used to induce abortion in the first l00 days
of gestation, but use for inducing abortion in small animals has been
questioned.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Prostaglandin F2 alpha causes increased smooth muscle tone, resulting in
diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, bronchoconstriction, and increase in blood
pressure. In small animals, other side effects include vomiting. Induction of
abortion may cause retained placenta.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not administer IV. Dinoprost induces abortion in pregnant animals. Use
caution when handling this drug by veterinarians, animal owners, and technical
help. It should not be handled by pregnant women. Absorption through intact
human skin is possible. People with respiratory problems also should not handle
dinoprost.
Drug Interactions
According to the label, dinoprost should not be used with nonsteroidal anti-
prostaglandins. However, NSAIDs should not affect concentrations of PGF2
alpha administered by this product. When using oxytocin concurrently, it should
bx used cautiously because there is a risk of uterine rupture.
242Dinoprost Tromethamine
Instructions for Use
Use in treating pyometra should be monitored carefully. If pyometra is not open,
severe consequences may result. When used in cattle, after a single injection, cattle

after injection.
 In pigs, administer within 3 days of predicted farrowing for parturition induction.
Farrowing should start in approximately 30 hours.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
When used for estrus synchronization, monitor for signs of estrus. Animals should
be bred at usual time relative to estrus.

Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antihistamine (H, blocker). Diphenhydramine is the active moiety of
dimenhydrinate (Dramamine). Similar to other antihistamines, it acts by blocking
the H, receptor (Hl) and suppresses inflammatory reactions caused by histamine.
Commonly used antihistamines include clemastine, chlorpheniramine,
diphenhydramine, and hydroxyzine.
Indications and Clinical Uses
 Diphenhydramine, like other antihistamines, is used to prevent allergic reactions
and for pruritus therapy in dogs and cats. However, success rates for treatment of
pruritus have not been high. In addition to the antihistamine effect for treating
allergies, these drugs block the effect of histamine in the vomiting center, vestibular
center, and other centers that control vomiting in animals.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Sedation is the most common side effect. Sedation is the result of inhibition of
histamine N-methyltransferase. Sedation may also be attributed to block of other
CNS receptors such as those for serotonin, acetylcholine, and alpha-receptors.
Antimuscarinic effects (atropine-like effects) also are common, including dry
mouth and decreased GI secretions. Excitement has been observed in cats and in
other animals at high doses.
Contraindications and Precautions
Antimuscarinic effects (atropine-like effects) are common. Do not use in
conditions for which anticholinergic drugs may be contraindicated, such as
glaucoma, ileus, or cardiac arrhythmias.
Drug Interactions
There are no specific drug interactions. However because of anticholinergic
(atropine-like) effects, it may counteract drugs that are administered for a
 parasympathomimetic action (e.g., drugs used to stimulate intestinal motility).
Instructions for Use
Antihistamine used primarily for allergic disease in animals. These drugs also
can be used to treat or prevent vomiting in animals. Clinical studies documenting
efficacy have been limited. Most use is empirical with doses extrapolated from
human use.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests

electrolyte absorption.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Diphenoxylate is used for acute treatment of nonspecific diarrhea. It has primarily
 a local effect. Loperamide (Imodium) has a similar action and has become more
popular for this indication. An additional use, not often used in veterinary medicine,
is as an antitussive.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects have not been reported in veterinary medicine. Diphenoxylate is
poorly absorbed systemically and produces few systemic side effects. Excessive use
can cause constipation.
Contraindications and Precautions

Dirlotapide
 Dir-loe' ta-pyed 
Trade and other names: Slentrol
Functional classification: Obesity medication
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Dirlotapide is used to produce weight loss in dogs. It is related to another
medication used for obesity in dogs, mitratapide (Yarvitan), which is approved in
Europe. Dirlotapide is an inhibitor of the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein
(MTP). The inhibition is selective, and the liver form of MTP is not affected in
Dirlotapide  247
dogs. Inhibition of this enzyme reduces the ability of intestinal enterocytes to
process tniglycerides by preventing uptake of lipids into cholemicrons. As a result,
there is decreased fat absorption and increased fecal fat. The accumulation of these
miglycenides in the intestinal cells sends a signal (satiety messenger) to the central
reduces the uptake of dietary lipids, in association with decreased postprandial serum
tiglycerides, phospholipids, and cholesterol. The weight loss is attributed to the
reduced appetite, rather than impaired processing of dietary lipids. It does not
produce a direct centrally acting effect. Bioavailability of oral dirlotapide is variable
but in the range of 20%-40%, with a volume of distribution (VD) of 1.3 L/kg. It is
highly protein bound. Administration with food increases absorption. The plasma
half-life is variable (l.2-ll hours). The effects on the intestinal cells and appetite
appear to be local (intestinal) rather than atributed to plasma levels because similar
weight reduction effects are not observed when dirlotapide is administered by
injection.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Dirlotapide is used in the management of obesity in dogs. During the treatment
protocol, there is a consistent weight loss (approximately 3% per month) that is
primarily fat tissue, not lean tissue. Overall, during the entire treatment period it
may result in weight loss of 18%-22% of body weight, but response can vary among
individual dogs. Dirlotapide should not be used without instituting the proper
protocol as outlined by the sponsor. It should be used in an overall weight
management program, which also includes appropriate dietary changes. Before using
to treat overweight or obesity, rule out other diseases such as hypothyroidism or
hyperadrenocorticism.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects are proportional to dose. Decreased appetite occurs as a mode of
action of the drug. Vomiting may also occur as a common effect related to the
drug's mechanism of action. Nausea and diarrhea also may occur. None of these
signs are necessarily cause to stop the medication and may resolve with time.
However, if vomiting and nausea persist, evaluation and adjustment of dose may
be necessary. Changes in liver enzymes also are expected. There may be increases
in ALT and AST liver enzymes associated with treatment. However, if there are
high increases in ALT, or marked elevation in other values (AST, GGT, Alk
Phos, or total bilirubin), treatment should be stopped and the patient reassessed.
There may be decreased absorption of fat-soluble vitamins A and E. The reduced
absorption of these vitamins has not been clinically significant.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not administer to cats. Do not use in dogs with concurrent liver disease or
dogs on long-term corticosteroid therapy. Humans should not take this drug.
 Safety in pregnancy has not been established.
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions have been reported. It has been safely administered with
NSAIDs and ACE inhibitors.

Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Adrenergic agonist. Dobutamine is a racemic mixture (R and S isomers) that has
both betaj- and betaz-adrenergic activity. However, its clinical effects are caused by
the relative cardioselective agonist activity on betaj receptors. There are both agonist
and antagonist effects on alpha-receptors, the clinical effects of which are uncertain.
without excessive tachycardia. The lack of tachycardia distinguishes it from other
contractility without increasing heart rates. Dobutamine has a short half-life in
animals (2-3 minutes). Therefore, it must be given via constant intravenous infusion
and has a short onset of activity.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Dobutamine is used primarily for the acute treatment of heart failure. It produces
an inotropic effect without increasing heart rates. Short treatment regimens
(e.g., 48 hours) can have a residual positive effect in some animals.
Precautionary Information

Dolasetron Mesylate
doe-lah'seh-tron mess'ih-late {also, dahl-AH-set-rahn}
Trade and other names: Anzemet
Functional classification: Antiemetic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antiemetic drug from the class of drugs called serotonin antagonists. These drugs
act by inhibiting serotonin (5-HT, type 3) receptors. During chemotherapy, there
may be 5-HT released from injury to the GI tract, which stimulates vomiting
centrally. The emetic response induced by serotonin is inhibited by this class of
drugs. In people, dolasetron is completely metabolized to hydrodolasetron (active),
antagonists used for antiemetic therapy include granisetron, ondansetron, dolasetron,
and tropisetron.
254 Dolasetron Mesylate
Indications and Clinical Uses
Like other serotonin antagonists, dolasetron is used primarily for its antiemetic

drugs in efficacy. These drugs also may be used to control vomiting from surgery
(postoperative nausea and vomiting).
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Dolasetron adverse effects have not been reported in animals. These drugs have
little affinity for other 5-HT receptors. Some effects may be indistinguishable
from concurrent cancer drugs.
Contraindications and Precautions
There are no important contraindications identified in animals
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions are reported. However, dolasetron is subject to effects from
cytochrome P450 inducers and inhibitors. (See Appendix.)
Instructions for Use
 Dolasetron has been used infrequently in veterinary medicine because of its
expense. Doses are derived from anecdotal experience or extrapolation from
human studies and no clinical studies are reported from animal studies. These
drugs are more effective if used to prevent vomiting (administered prior to a

Domperidone 255
Domperidone
dahm-pare'ih-done
Trade and other names: Motilium and Equidone
Functional classification: Prokinetic agent
D
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Dompenidone is a motility modifier with actions similar to metoclopramide,
although it is chemically unrelated. A difference between metoclopramide and
dompenidone is that the latter does not cross the blood-brain barrier. Therefore,
adverse CNS effects are not as much of a problem with domperidone. Domperidone
stimulates motility of the upper GI tract, probably through dopaminergic effects
or by increasing acetylcholine effects. The action of dompenidone is to inhibit
dopamine receptors and enhance action of acetylcholine in GI tract.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Domperidone has been used to treat gastroparesis and treatment of vomiting. In
horses, domperidone has been used to treat fescue toxicosis and periparturient
agalactia. Fescue toxicosis is caused by a fingus that produces a toxin, which causes
reproductive problems in horses. The action of domperidone to increase lactation is
through the stimulation of prolactin.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects that are seen with metoclopramide are not as common with
domperidone because it does not cross the blood-brain bamier as readily as
metoclopramide. It causes a transient increase in aldosterone and prolactin
secretion. It has also caused a transient increase in plasma ACTH, which could
exacerbate equine Cushing's syndrome.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not use in patients with GI obstruction.
Drug Interactions
Acidity is needed for oral administration. Do not administer with stomach
antacids such as omeprazole, cimetidine, or antacids.
Instructions for Use
in animals. A formulation has been available as an investigational drug for use in
horses in the US for treatment of agalactia and fescue toxicosis.

Dopamine Hydrochloride
doe'pah-meen hye-droe-kloride
 Trade and other names: Intropin
Functional classification: Cardiac inotropic agent
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Adrenergic and dopamine agonist. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter and an
immediate precursor to norepinephrine. At low doses it stimulates the
dopamine (DA,) receptors, at moderate doses it stimulates the adrenergic
receptors, and at high doses it acts as an alphaj-receptor agonist (producing
vasoconstriction). At doses that stimulate DAj receptors, it increases c-AMP in
smooth muscle cells and causes relaxation and vasodilation. It has been administered
to stimulate the heart and to increase urine flow (see below for explanation of renal
effects).
Indications and Clinical Uses
Dopamine is used therapeutically to stimulate myocardium via action on cardiac
 betaj-receptors. Dopamine infusions will increase both blood pressure and cardiac
output. These effects are caused by stimulating cardiac contractility and heart rate by
acting as an agonist for betaj-adrenergic receptors. In addition, dopamine increases
the release of norepinephrine from nerve teminals (dopamine is a precursor for
been proposed that dopamine dilates renal arterioles, increases renal blood flow, and
of renal dopamine-l (DA,) receptors. Because of this proposed effect, in the past it
has been used for acute renal failure. However, recent evaluation has raised doubts
about the clinical effectiveness of dopamine for treatment of acute renal failure. Cats
do not have as many DAj receptors as other animals; therefore, it has not been

effective in cats to produce diuresis. In addition, evaluation in people and other
animals has not produced desired effects
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Dopamine may cause tachycardia and ventricular arhythmias at high doses or in
sensitive individuals.
Contraindications and Precautions
Dopamine is unstable in alkaline fluids.
Drug Interactions
 Do not mix with alkaline solutions. Otherwise, it is compatible with most fluid
solutions.
Instructions for Use
Dopamine has a rapid elimination half-life (minutes) and therefore must be
administered via carefully monitored constant rate infusion (CRI). Because the
actions of dopamine are dose dependent, the rate administered is adjusted to reach
the desired clinical effect. Dopamine has been administered at doses of 2-l0 mcg/
kg/min for the acute management of heart failure and cardiogenic shock. When
preparing intravenous solutions, one may admix 200-400 mg of dopamine with
250-500 mL of fluid. Dopamine is unstable in alkaline fuid solutions, such as those
containing bicarbonate.
Low dose (vasodilation, D receptor): 0.5-2 mcg/kg/min; medium dose (cardiac
stimulating, betaj-receptor): 2-10 mcg/kg/min; and high dose (vasoconstriction,
alpha-receptors): >10 mcg/kg/min.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor heart rate and rhythm while administering dopamine.
Formulations
 Dopamine is available in 40, 80, and 160 mg/mL for IV injection.
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature. It
may be added to fluids such as 5% dextrose, saline, and lactated Ringer's solution. It
is stable for 24 hours after dilution. Do not use if solution turns a brown or purple
color.

258 Doramectin
Doramectin
dore-ah-mek'tin
Trade and other names: Dectomax
Functional classification: Antiparasitic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antiparasitic drug. Avermectins (ivermectin-like drugs) and milbemycins (milbemycin,
doramectin, and moxidectin) are macrocyclic lactones and share similarities, including
glutamate-gated chloride ion channels in parasites. Paralysis and death of the parasite
is caused by increased permeability to chloride ions and hyperpolarization of nerve
cells. These drugs also potentiate other chloride channels, including ones gated by
GABA. Mammals ordinarily are not affected, because they lack glutamate-gated
chloride channels, and there is a lower affinity for other mammalian chloride channels.
Because these drugs ordinarily do not penetrate the blood-brain barrier, GABA-gated
channels in the CNS of mammals are not affected. Therefore, it produces longer and
more sustained plasma concentrations. It is effective against nematodes and
arthropods but has no effect on flukes or tapeworms.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Doramectin is used for treatment or prevention of GI parasite (nematode) infections
in livestock, lice infestation, lungworm infection, and treatment of scabies. There
are reports of a single injection (200-300 mcg/kg) used in cats for treatment of
notoednic mange {infections from the mite Notoedres cati).
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Toxicity may occur at high doses and in breeds in which ivermectin-like drugs
cross the blood-brain barrier. Sensitive breeds include collies, Australian
shepherds, Shetland sheepdogs, and old English sheepdogs. Toxicity is neurotoxic,
and signs include depression, ataxia, impaired vision, coma, and death. Sensitivity
to ivermectin-like drugs may be because of mutation in the blood-brain barrier
reactions in tissues from dead larvae. These drugs are safe for pregnant animals. No
adverse effects were seen in cats treated with doses as high as 345 mcg/kg.
Contraindications and Precautions
Doramectin is only approved in cattle. Certain breeds of dogs (Shetland
sheepdogs and Collie-type breeds) are more sensitive to adverse effects than other
breeds.
Drug Interactions
 Use cautiously with drugs that may inhibit p-glycoprotein at the blood-brain
barrier (see Appendix).
Instructions for Use
Doses vary depending on use. In cattle, for treatment of hypodermal larvae,
treatment should begin at the end of fly season. Administration to cattle should use
a l6- or l8-gauge needle for subcutaneous administration. For intramuscular
Doripenem  259

Doripenem
dor-i-pen'em
Trade and other names: Doribax
Functional classification: Antibacterial
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Beta-lactam antibiotic of the carbapenems class with broad spectrum of activity.
Action on cell wall is similar to other beta-lactams, which is to bind penicillin-
binding proteins (PBP) that weaken or interfere with cell wall formation. In
Escherichin coliand Psendomonas aeruginosa, doripenem binds to PBP 2,which is
260 Doripenem
involved in the maintenance of cell shape, and to PBPs 3 and 4. Carbapenems have
a broad spectrum of activity and are among the most active of all antibiotics.
Doripenem has similar activity as imipenem and meropenem to include gram-
negative bacilli, including Enterobacteriacene and Psendomonas neruginosn. It is
slightly more active against Psendomonas aeruginosa. It also is active against most
gram-positive bacteria, except methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus. It is not
active against Enterococcns.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Doripenem is indicated primarily for resistant infections caused by bacteria resistant
to other drugs. It is especially valuable for treating resistant infections caused by
Psendomonas nernginosn, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pnenmonine. Doripenem is
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Carbapenems pose similar risks as other beta-lactam antibiotics, but adverse
effects are rare. Doripenem does not cause seizures as frequently as imipenem
Contraindications and Precautions
Some slight yellowish discoloration may occur after reconstitution. Slight
discoloration will not affect potency. However, a darker amber or brown
discoloration may indicate oxidation and loss of potency.
Drug Interactions

Doxapram Hydrochloride
doks'ah-pram hye-droe-klor'ide
Trade and other names: Dopram, Respiram
Functional classification: Respiratory stimulant
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
 Respiratory stimulation of doxapram results from direct stimulation of the
medullary respiratory center and activation of the aortic and carotid body
sensitive to changes in CO2, which in turn stimulate the respiratory center.
 Doxapram is used primarily in emergency during anesthesia or to decrease the
respiratory depressant effects of certain drugs (e.g, opiates, barbiturates). An
important use in veterinary medicine is stimulation of respiration in young horses.
The half-life is short (2 hours), but the duration of action is only 5-l0 minutes after
IV administration.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Doxapram may stimulation respiration in dogs, cats, and horses, during
and after general anesthesia. It has been used to stimulate respiration on
increase ventilation (tidal volume, respiratory rate) and reduce acidosis. In horses,
doxapram will cause cardiac stimulation and respiratory stimulation. There have
shortly after birth and subsequently decrease the incidence of failure of passive
transfer of immunoglobulins. The primary use of doxapram in horses is for
encephalopathy (perinatal asphyxia or neonatal maladjustment syndrome) in
neonatal foals. Administration to foals has restored normal ventilation, improved
blood pH, PaO2, and respiratory rate in neonatal foals in a dose-dependent
manner. Doxapram also has been used in dogs to assist in the diagnosis of laryngeal
paralysis.

Indications and Clinical Uses
Doxepin has been used to treat anxiety disorders and dermatologic conditions
D
in dogs and cats. Some use for dermatitis is related to the drug's antihistamine
properties. Although it has been used for treating pruritus and dermatitis in small
animals, it has not been effective for treating atopic dermatitis in dogs. Doxepin has
been used to treat lick granuloma in dogs.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Tricyclic antidepressants have some antimiscarinic effects that may increase heart
rate, cause xerostomia, and affect the GI tract. Some sedation is possible with
doxepin.
Contraindications and Precautions
As with other tricyclic antidepressants, do not administer with other

RCI Classifcation: 2
Doxorubicin Hydrochloride
doks-oh-roo'bih-sin hye-droe-kloride
Trade and other names: Adriamycin
Functional classification: Anticancer agent
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Doxorubicin damages DNA by inhibition of the enzyme topoisomerase II. This
enzyme is responsible for DNA functions. When topoisomerase is inhibited, the
DNA segments cannot perform transcription, leading to breaks in the DNA strands
and cell death. Secondarily, this mechanism causes cell death by blocking synthesis
of RNA and proteins. Doxorubicin also forms free radicals (OH) that can attack
DNA and lead to oxidation of DNA. In dogs, the half-life has varied from 8.7 hours
to 1l hours, with volume of distribution 0.6-0.7 L/kg and clearance 52-83 L/kg/
hr. In cats the pharmacokinetics are highly variable with half-lives ranging from ll
minutes to 9.5 hours. Other antitumor antibiotics include mitoxantrone,
actinomycin D, and bleomycin.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Doxorubicin is used for treatment of various neoplasia, including hemangiosarcoma
and lymphoma. Doxorubicin is commonly used in humans for the treatment of
breast tumors, various sarcomas, and osteosarcoma. In veterinary medicine it has
been used for lymphoma, osteosarcoma, and other carcinomas and sarcomas. It is
considered one of the most effective single agents in the treatment of lymphoma. It
is used commonly in cancer protocols with other agents.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effcts limit the frequency and cumulative doses that can be
administered. Bone marrow toxicity is the major adverse effect that limits the
frequency of acute administration, and the cardiotoxicity is the major effect
that limits the chronic administration. The nadir of bone marrow depression
(leukopenia) is at 7 to l0 days. The stem cells are usually spared and recovery
occurs within 2l days following cach dose. Cardiac toxicity is caused by an acute
effect during administration seen as arrhythmias and decreased systolic function
and a chronic effect that is manifest as cardiomyopathy and congestive heart
failure. Cardiac toxicity is dose related. The risk of chronic effects increases as
total cumulative doses exceed 200-240 mg/m?. In some dogs, cardiac changes
can be observed as soon as after l20 mg/m' cumulative dose. Dexrazoxane
Doxorubicin Hydrochloride265
(Zinecard) is a potent chelator of iron and has been used to decrease the adverse
cardiac effects in some patients. Alopecia is common in people but primarily is
seen only in dogs that have continuously growing hair (e.g. poodles). Cats may
lose their whiskers. Gastrointestinal acute side effects—anorexia, vomiting, and
darrhea—were the most common acute side effects. Hypersensitivity (allergic)
reactions are not life-threatening, but they can occur commonly. They are
probably not true allergic reactions, but are simply the result of mast cell
degranulation that occurs independently of IgG binding. Signs of this reaction
are head shaking (ear prunitus) and generalized urticana and erythema. Cats are
more sensitive to adverse effects than dogs, so lower doses are used in cats.
Adverse effects in cats include anorexia, vomiting, and renal injury. In horses,
adverse effects included bone marrow suppression, hair loss, dermatitis, and other
skin reactions.
Contraindications and Precautions
 Do not use in animals with cardiomyopathy. Monitor CBC in patients before and
after treatment. If significant leukopenia (particularly neutropenia of fewer than
1000 cells) is present, withhold treatment or use a lower-dose intensity. Use
cautiously in dogs with known mutation deficiency in the MDR membrane
transporter (p-glycoprotein) (e.g., Collie and related breeds). These dogs are
more prone to toxicity.
Drug Interactions
Doxorubicin is commonly administered with other anticancer drugs, antiemetics,
and antihistamines without adverse effects. However, doxorubicin is a
 P-glycoprotein substrate and should not be used with drugs that are
P-glycoprotein inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine or ketoconazole). (See Appendix for
list of inhibitors.)
Instructions for Use
Regimen listed may differ for various tumors. To prepare solution, the total dose is
diluted in a saline fluid solution of 25 or 50 mL and infised slowly over 20-30
minutes, but preferably over 60 minutes. Extending duration of infusion to 2-3
hours may decrease some adverse effects. For cats, mix l mg/mL in saline solution
and administer IV over 5-10 minutes with fluids. In cats SQ fluids (22 mL/kg) may
be administered with doxorubicin. This drug is very irritating and special care must
be made to ensure that extravasation from the vein does not occur. For canine
lymphoma, some oncologists believe that remission of cancer is best achieved when
five treatments are administered (target 150-180 mg/m² cumulative dose). In
chemotherapy protocols it is sometimes administered with cyclophosphamide.
therapy. Most often it is administered on a body surface area rate (mg/m');
however, dose according to body weight (mg/kg) may be safer for small dogs (see
Small Animal Dosage section). In cats, additional SQ fluids are administered to
prevent renal toxicity.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor ECG during therapy. ECGs should be performed periodically in dogs to
look for evidence of myocardial toxicity. CBC should be monitored regularly and
prior to each treatment because of risk of myelotoxicity.

Doxycycline Hyclate, Doxycycline Monohydrate
doks-ih-sye'kleen
Trade and other names: Vibramycin, Monodox, Doxy Caps, and generic
brands
Functional classification: Antibacternial
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Tetracycline antibiotic. Mechanism of action of tetracyclines is to bind to the 30S
ribosomal subunit and inhibit protein synthesis. The action of tetracyclines is usually
bacteriostatic. It has a broad spectrum of activity including bacteria, some protozoa,
Rickettsin, and Ehrlichin.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Doxycycline is usually the drug of choice for treating tick-borne diseases in animals.
Effcacy has been demonstrated in research studies and in some clinical studies. It
is used for treating infections caused by bacteria, some protozoa, Rickettsia, and
Ehrlichia. Doxycycline administered to cats with infections caused by Mycoplasmn,
or Chlamydophilia felis(fomerly Chlamydiapsittaci) at 10-15 mg/kg once daily
PO, or 5 mg/kg ql2h PO, has been effective in eliminating the organism and
improving clinical signs. In dogs at 5 mg/kg ql2h PO for 3-4 weeks has cleared
Ebrlichia canis from blood and tissues. Doxycycline is often added to heartworm
treatment because of the activity against the organism Wolbachin. This combination,
although controversial, may improve microfiliaricidal effect when combined with
 ivermectin, improve response to adulticidal treatment with melarsomine, and
decrease injury to pulmonary vessels. In horses, is has been used to treat
Ehrlichiosis, but also has been used to treat other diseases (e.g., respiratory
infections) when oral treatment is indicated.
Doxycycline Hyclate, Doxycycline Monohydrate 267
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Tetracyclines may cause renal tubular necrosis at high doses and can affect bone
and teeth formation in young animals. However, doxycycline has not been
reported to cause these problems in animals. Doxycycline administered orally to
cats has caused esophageal irritation, tissue injury, and esophageal stricture. This
may be caused by solid-dose formulations (primarily doxycycline hyclate rather
1
than doxycycline monohydrate) becoming entrapped in the esophagus. Passage
into the stomach by giving the cat water or food after administration is advised
to prevent this effect. Doxycycline given IV to horses has been fatal; however, it
quine studies there were no adverse effects reported from oral administration. In
another study, one of the horses in a pharmacokinetic trial developed signs of
entenitis and colic.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not administer to young animals because it can affect bone and teeth
formation. However, it has been better tolerated in children than other
tetracyclines. If solid-dose forms are administered to cats, lubricate the tablet/
capsule, or follow with food or water to ensure passage into stomach. Do not
administer rapidly IV. Do not administer solution IM or SQ. Do not administer
IV to horses under any circumstances; acute death has been reported from this use.
Drug Interactions
Tetracyclines bind to compounds containing calcium, which decreases oral
absorption. However, this is less of a problem with doxycycline than with other
tetracyclines. Doxycycline has been mixed with milk prior to oral administration
to children without decreasing effcacy.
Instructions for Use
Many pharmacokinetic and experimental studies have been conducted in small
animals. Doxycycline is ordinarily considered the drug of choice for Rickettsin and
Ehrlichia infections in dogs. Doxycycline is more effective than enrofloxacin for
Ehrlichin.When used with ivermectin (6 mcg/kg weekly) for heartworm treatment,
doxycycline was administered at a dose of l0 mg/kg per day intermittently for
several months (e.g., 20 months out of 36 months). To prepare doxycycline
intravenous infusion solution, add 10 mL to a 100-mg vial or 20 mL to a 200-mg
vial and then further dilute for IV use in 100 to 1000 mL of LRS or 5% dextrose.
Infuse over l to 2 hours (see Stability and Storage section).
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Susceptibility testing: CLSI break points for sensitive organisms are <2 mcg/mL for
streptococci and <4 for other organisms. Tetracycline is used as a marker to test
susceptibility for other drugs in this class, such as doxycycline, minocycline, and
oxytetracycline.
Formulations
Doxycycline is available in a 10-mg/mL oral suspension, 50- or l00-mg tablets, and
 50- and 100-mg capsules (doxycycline hyclate). Doxycycline monohydrate is available
as 50- or l00-mg tablets or capsules. A controlled-release formulation (Oracea)
contains l0-mg delayed release and 30-mg immediate release in one capsule.
Doxycycline hyclate injection is available in a l00- and 200-mg injection vial.
268   Dronabinol
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature.
Avoid mixing with cations such as iron, calcium, aluminum, and zinc. However,
doxycycline tablets have been mixed with milk and immediately administered to
children without loss of potency. Doxycycline hyclate for injection will retain
potency for l2 hours at room temperature or 72 hours reffigerated after
rconstitution at concentrations up to l mg/mL. IV solutions are stable in LRS or
5% dextrose for 6 hours at room temperature. Protect IV solutions from light. If
frozen after reconstitution with sterile water, solutions of l0 mg/mL are potent for

Dronabinol
droe-nabrih-nole
Trade and other names: Marinol
Functional classification: Antiemetic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antiemetic from the cannabinoid class. The site of action is unknown, but there is
some evidence that the active ingredient may affect opiate receptors, or they may
affect other receptors in the vomiting center. For dronabinol, the oral absorption is
good, but bioavailability is low because of high first-pass effects. The volume of
distribution is high.
Dronabinol  269
Indications and Clinical Uses
Cannabinoids have been used in people who have not responded to any other
antiemetic drugs (e.g., patients who are receiving anticancer drugs). They have also
gained recent popularity to increase the appetite in patients with terminal disease,
cancer, and AIDS. Their use has not been reported in veterinary patients, but they
have been used by some veterinarians to increase the appetite in cats.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Cannabinoids are relatively well tolerated in people, but side effects include
drowsiness, dizziness, ataxia, and disorientation. Withdrawal signs may occur after
abrupt discontinuation after repeated doses.
Contraindications and Precautions
No known contraindications.
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions reported for animals.
Instructions for Use
Dronabinol is a form of synthetic marijuana (THC) and is available as an antiemetic

Edrophonium Chloride 271
Edrophonium Chloride
ed-roe-foe'nee-um klorride
Trade and Other Names: Tensilon and generic brands
Functional Classification: Antimyasthenic, anticholinesterase
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Cholinesterase inhibitor. Edrophonium causes cholinergic effects by inhibiting
E
metabolism of acetylcholine. Its effects do not last long and is used for short-term
use only.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Because edrophonium is short acting, it ordinarily is only used for diagnostic
purposes (e.g., myasthenia gravis). It also has been used to reverse neuromuscular
blockade of nondepolarizing agents (pancuronium).
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Edrophonium is short acting and side effects are minimal. Overdose in
nonmyasthenia animals may cause salivation, retching, vomiting, and diarrhea. If
this is observed, administer atropine at 0.02-0.04 mg/kg. Excessive muscarinic/
cholinergic effects may occur with high doses; these may also be counteracted
with atropine.
Contraindications and Precautions
Edrophonium will potentiate effects of other cholinergic drugs. Cats are
especially sensitive to edrophonium (see dose differences in Small Animal Dosage
section).
Drug Interactions
Use cautiously with other cholinergic drugs.
Instructions for Use
Edrophonium is used only for determination of diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. An
alternative drug for this purpose is neostigmine methylsulfate (Prostigmin) at
40 mcg/kg IM or 20 mcg/kg IV.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests

RCI Classification: 3
Enalapril Maleate
eh-nal'ah-prill mal'ee-ate
Trade and Other Names: Enacard (veterinary preparation) and Vasotec (human
preparation)
Functional Classification: Vasodilator, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
inhibitor
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
ACE inhibitor. Like other ACE inhibitors, it inhibits conversion of angiotensin
I to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor and will also
stimulate sympathetic stimulation, renal hypertension, and synthesis of aldosterone.
The ability of aldosterone to cause sodium and water retention contributes to
congestion.
Enalapril, like other ACE inhibitors, will cause vasodilation and decrease
aldosterone-induced congestion, but ACE inhibitors also contribute to vasodilation
by increasing concentrations of some vasodilating kinins and prostaglandins.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Enalapril, like other ACE inhibitors, is used to treat hypertension and CHF.
Effcacy for CHF is good and can be used with other drugs such as pimobendan,
furosemide, digoxin, and spironolactone. It is primarily used in dogs. In addition to
onset of CHF in dogs with mitral regurgitation. The benefit of enalapril and other
ACE inhibitors for occult heart disease is controversial; some studies have shown a
         g     s
or with systemic hypertension. Unfortunately, approximately 50% of cats with
hypertension do not respond to enalapril, and ACE inhibitors are not considered a
primary treatment for hypertension in cats.
ACE inhibitors also have been shown to be beneficial in the management of
certain types of kidney disorders (nephropathy) and for renal hypertension. Renal
benefits result from limiting systemic and glomerular capillary hypertension, the
 antiproteinuric effect to decrease in urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, and retarding
the development of glomerular sclerosis and tubulointerstitial lesions. ACE inhibitors
have decreased proteinurina in patients, but long-term benefits on survival have not
been established. The benefits of ACE inhibitor treatment in cats with chronic renal
disease are somewhat modest and have little effect on survival time or long-term
prognosis.
Large animal uses have not been established, but in horses the metabolite
enalaprilat at 0.5 mg/kg IV completely inhibited ACE activity but did not change
blood pressure or other hemodynamic variables in response to exercise.
Enalapril Maleate 273
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
receiving high doses of diuretics.
Contraindications and Precautions
Discontinue ACE inhibitors in pregnant animals; they cross the placenta and have
caused fetal malformations and death of the fetus.
Drug Interactions
E
Use cautiously with other hypotensive drugs and diuretics. Nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may decrease vasodilating effects.
Instructions for Use
Doses are based on clinical trials conducted in dogs. For dogs, start with once-daily
administration and increase to ql2h if needed. Other drugs used for treatment of
heart failure may be used concurrently.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor patients carefully to avoid hypotension. With all ACE inhibitors, monitor
electrolytes and renal function 3-7 days after initiating therapy and periodically
thereafter.
Formulations
Enalapril is available as Vasotec (human preparation) in 2.5-, 5-, 10-, and 20-mg
tablets and as Enacard (veterinary preparation) in 1-, 2.5-, 5-, 10-, and 20-mg

274 Enflurane
Enflurane
en-floor'ane
Trade and Other Names: Ethrane
Functional Classification: Inhalant anesthetic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Inhalant anesthetic. Like other inhalant anesthetics, the mechanism of action is
uncertain. Enflurane produces a generalized, reversible, depression of the CNS. The
inhalant anesthetics vary in their solubility in blood, their potency, and the rate of
 induction and recovery. Those with low blood/gas partition coefficients are
associated with the most rapid rates of induction and recovery. Enflurane has a
'8'I yo yuyao uoued ses/pooq e (o ie) H wu sI go ansssd oda
and a fat/blood coeffcient of 36.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Enflurane, like other inhalant anesthetics, is used for general anesthesia in animals. It
has a minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) value of 2.37%, 2.06%, and 2.12% in
cats, dogs, and horses, respectively.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Like other inhalant anesthetics, enflurane produces vasodilation and increased
blood flow to cerebral blood vessels. This may increase intracranial pressure. Like
other inhalant anesthetics, it produces a dose-dependent myocardial depression
and alveolar ventilation. Like other inhalant anesthetics it increases the risk of
ventricular arrhythmias, especially in response to catecholamines.
Contraindications and Precautions
No specific contraindications are reported for animals.
Drug Interactions
Other sedatives and anesthetics (e.g., opiates, benzodiazepines, phenothiazines,
alpha-2 agonists) will lower the requirement for inhalent gas anesthesia
Instructions for Use
Titrate dose for each individual with anesthetic monitoring.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor anesthesia parameters. During anesthesia, monitor heart rate and rhythm
and respiratory rate.
Formulations
Enflurane is available as a solution for inhalation.

Enoxaparin sodium
en-oks'ah-pare-in
Trade and Other Names: Lovenox and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)
Functional Classification: Anticoagulant
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), also known as fragmented heparin.
LMWH is characterized by a molecular weight composed of approximately 5000,
compared to conventional heparin (unfractionated) with a molecular weight of
approximately 15,000. Subsequently, the absorption, clearance, and activity of
LMWH differ from unfractionated heparin (UFH). LMWHs produce their effect by
binding to antithrombin (AT) and increasing antithrombin III-mediated inhibition
of synthesis and activity of coagulation factor Xa. However, LMWH, unlike
conventional heparin, produces less inhibition of thrombin (factor IIa). LMWH's
LMWHs have several advantages compared to UFH and include greater anti-Xa/IIa
activity, more complete and predictable absorption from injection, longer duration,
less frequent administration, reduced risk of bleeding, and a more predictable
anticoagulant response. However, in dogs and cats, the half-life of LMWH is much
   s     s  s u n

Enoxaparin sodium 277
activity compared to humans. LMWHs used in veterinary medicine include
(ui) uuedep pue (xouaot) uuedexoua (dqouui) uuedezu
Indications and Clinical Uses
Enoxaparin, like other LMWHs, is used to treat hypercoagulability disorders and
prevent coagulation disorders such as thromboembolism, venous thrombosis,
disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), and pulmonary thromboembolism.
Clinical indications are derived from uses of conventional heparin or extrapolated
from human medicine. There have been few clinical studies to examine efficacy of
LMWH in animals. Previously published doses extrapolated from humans have been
shown not to produce adequate and consistent anti-Xa activity in dogs and cats, and
the doses listed in this entry are needed for therapy.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Although better tolerated than regular heparin, bleeding is a risk. However,
LMWHs produce less bleeding problems than administration of conventional
heparin. LMWHs are associated with a lower incidence of heparin-induced
anticoagulation and bleeding occur as a result of an overdose, protamine sulfate
should be administered to reverse heparin therapy. Protamine dose is l.0 mg
'uoisnyul AI mois Aq paaisupe uuedexous Su o' I Aaaa iny auueioid
Protamine complexes with heparin to form a stable, inactive compound.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not administer IM to prevent hematoma; administer SQ only. LMWH is
excreted by renal clearance in animals; therefore, if renal disease is present, the
elimination will be prolonged. Rebound hypercoagulability may occur after
discontinuation of heparin treatment; therefore, it may be advised to taper the
dose slowly when discontinuing treatment.
Drug Interactions
Do not mix with other injectable drugs. Use cautiously in animals that are
already receiving other drugs that can interfere with coagulation, such as aspinin
 and warfarin. Although a specifc interaction has not been identifed, use
cautiously in animals that may be receiving certain chondroprotective compounds
such as glycosaminoglycans for treatment of arthritis. Some antibiotics, such as
cephalosporins, may inhibit coagulation.
Instructions for Use
Dosing recommendations extrapolated from human medicine are not appropriate for
animals. Animal owners should be wamed that LMWHs are expensive compared to
conventional heparin. When dosing, do not interchange doses on a unit-for-unit
basis with heparin or other low-molecular-weight heparins because they differ in
manufacturing process, molecular weight distribution, anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities,
units, and dosage.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
LMWH, aPTT and PT clotting times are not reliable indicators of therapy, although
prolonged aPTT is a sign of overdosing. Anti-Xa activity is considered the preferred
278 Enrofloxacin
laboratory measure of LMWH activity in people, but the use of this parameter is
controversial in animals. Peak anti-Xa activity occurs 3-4 hours after dosing and the
target range for anti-Xa activity should be 0.5-1.0 U/mL for cats and 0.5-2.0 U/
mL for dogs.

Enrofloxacin
en-roe-floks'ah-sin 
Trade and Other Naimes: Baytril
Functional Classification: Antibacterial
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Fluoroquinolone antibacterial drug. Enrofloxacin acts via inhibition of DNA gyrase
in bacteria to inhibit DNA and RNA synthesis. Enrofloxacin is a bactericidal with a
broad spectrum of activity. In most animal species, enrofloxacin is metabolized to
ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin is an active desmethyl metabolite of enrofloxacin and
may contribute in an additive fashion to the antibacterial effects. At the peak
total concentration in cats and dogs, respectively. Susceptible bacteria include
Staphylococcns,Escherichin coli,Protens,Klebsielln,andPasteurella.Psendomonns
has poor activity against Streptococcus and anaerobic bacteria.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Enrofloxacin, like other fluoroquinolones, is used to treat susceptible bacteria in a
variety of species. Treatment has included infections of skin and soft tissue, U'TIs
in dogs and cats, Chla mydophila felisinfections in cats, and and ulcerrative colitis
caused by Escherichin coli in dogs. In horses it has been used for a vaniety of soft

tissue infections and respiratory infections, although this use is based primarily on
anecdotal experience. Enrofloxacin is approved for the treatment and control of
swine respiratory disease (SRD) associated with Actinobacillus plewropnenmonine,
Pasteurelln mnitocidn,Haemophiinsparnsnis, and Streptococcns snis.Itisalso
approved for treatment of bovine respiratory disease (BRD) associated with
Mannheimiabaemolytica,P.multocida,andHaemophilns somni(previously
Haemophiins somnns). Enrofloxacin has been shown effective for treating Rickettsia
infections in dogs. However, it is not effective for treating Ebrlichin (see
Doxycycline). Enrofloxacin is also used in most exotic animal species because of its
     
Precautionary Tnformation
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
High concentrations may cause CNS toxicity, especially in animals with renal
failure. It may cause occasional vomiting and, at high doses, may cause some
nausea and diarrhea. All of the fluoroquinolones may cause arthropathy in young
animals. Dogs are most sensitive at 4 weeks to 28 weeks of age. Large, rapidly
growing dogs are the most susceptible. Cats are relatively resistant to cartilage
[au Aq pasnen sh ieun sie ui ssauua 'aiandasns are sieog inq 'ani
degeneration has been reported. Affected cats have had permanent blindness.
This may be a dose-related effect. Cats administered doses of 20 mg/kg
restrictions in cats have been used. Administration of concentrated solution
(l00 mg/mL) given orally to horses has caused oral mucosal lesions. When
injected, this solution (pH 10.5) may be irritating to some tissues.
Contraindications and Precautions
Avoid use in young dogs because of risk of cartilage injury. Do not administer to
young foals; injury to articular cartilage has been reported. Use cautiously in
animals that may be prone to seizures, such as epileptics. Do not administer to
cats at doses greater than 5 mg/kg/day.
Drug Interactions
Fluoroquinolones may increase concentrations of theophylline if used
concurrently. Coadministration with divalent and trivalent cations, such as
products containing aluminum (e.g., sucralfate), iron, and calcium, may decrease
Do not mix in solutions or in vials with aluminum, calcium, iron, or zinc
because chelation may occur. Enrofloxacin may precipitate in an IV line if
injected directly into IV fluids.
Instructions for Use
Low dose of 5 mg/kg/day is used for sensitive organisms with minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) values of 0.l2 mcg/mL or less or uninary tract infection. A
dose of 5-10 mg/kg/day is used for organisms with MIC of 0.12-0.5 mcg/mL
(e.g, gram-positive bactenia). A dose of l0-20 mg/kg/day is used for organisms
with MIC of 0.5-1.0 mcg/mL (e.g., Psendomonas aernginosa). The solution is not
approved for intravenous use, but it has been administered via this route safely if
given slowly. Enrofloxacin was not absorbed in cats after transdermal application in
a pluronic gel vehicle. Concentrated enrofloxacin solution (cattle formulation at
100 mg/mL) is basic (pH 1o.5); therefore it can be irnitating to some animals when
280   Enrofloxacin
injected IM. Do not inject more than 20 mL at each site. Also, this formulation
may precipitate out of solution if pH is decreased by other solutions.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Susceptibility testing: For small animals, CLSI break points for sensitive organisms
are <0.5 mcg/mL. MIC values ≥4 are considered resistant. If MIC values are l or
2 mcg/mL, higher doses may be justified. For cattle, the break point for sensitive
organisms is ≤0.25 mcg/mL. Other fluoroquinolones may be used in some cases
to estimate susceptibility to this fluoroquinolone, but a test using a specific drug
is recommended. Ciprofloxacin break point for susceptibility is <l.0 mcg/mL.
However,if ciprofloxacin is used to treat Psewdomonas it may be several times more
active than other fluoroquinolones. Enrofloxacin may cause a false-positive result on
Formulations
Enrofloxacin is available in 22.7- and 68-mg tablets; Taste Tabs are 22.7, 68, and
 preparation for large animals ( Baytril-100).
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature.
Stability of compounded formulations has been evaluated and it was found to be
stable with many mixtures. However, do not mix with solutions that contain ions
that may chelate with enrofloxacin (iron, magnesium, aluminum, and calcium). If
administered IV, it is recommended to frst dilute the solution in fluids (e.g., l : 10
dilution) and infuse slowly. The lo0-mg/mL solution is alkaline and contains
benzyl alcohol and l-arginine as a base. If pH of this solution is lowered, it may
precipitate. The 22.7-mg/mL formulation has a pH of ll.5 and may not be
compatible with some solutions.

Trade and Other Names: Adrenaline and generic brands
Functional Classification: Adrenergic agonist
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
beta-adrenergic receptors. Epinephrine is a potent adrenergic agonist with a prompt
onset and a short duration of action.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Epinephrine is used primarily for emergency situations to treat cardiopulmonary arrest
and anaphylactic shock. It is administered IV, IM, or endotracheal for acute use.
Vasopressin (arginine vasopressin) has replaced epinephrine in some cardiopulmonary
resuscitation protocols. Epinephrine has been used in horses to test for diagnosis of
anhidrosis, but terbutaline sulfate challenge is used more frequently for this test.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Overdose will cause excessive vasoconstriction and hypertension. High doses can
cause ventricular arrhythmias. When high doses are used for cardiopulmonary
arrest, an electrical defibrillator should be available.
Contraindications and Precautions
Avoid repeated administration in patients.
Drug Interactions
Epinephrine will interact with other drugs that are used to either potentiate or
antagonize alpha-adrenergic or beta-adrenergic receptors. It is incompatible with
alkaline solutions (e.g., bicarbonate), chlorine, bromine, and salts of metals or
oxidizing solutions. Do not mix with bicarbonates, nitrates, citrates, and other salts.
Instructions for Use
 Doses are based on experimental studies, primarily in dogs. Clinical studies are not
available. Intravenous doses are ordinarily used, but endotracheal administration is

Indications and Clinical Uses
Epoetin alpha is used to treat nonregenerative anemia. It has been used to treat
myelosuppression caused by disease or chemotherapy. It also has been used to treat
chronic anemia associated with chronic renal failure. The value of epoetin alpha to
improve anemia in cats with chronic renal failure has been established in several
studies. In some animals, anemia is also caused by iron deficiency and can be
combined with ferous sulfate at a dose of 50-100 mg per cat daily.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
 Because this product is a human-recombinant product, it may induce local and
systemic allergic reactions in animals. Injection site pain and headache have
occurred in people. Seizures also have occurred. Delayed anemia may occur
because of cross-reacting antibodies against animal erythropoietin (reversible
when drug is withdrawn). Antiepoetin antibodies may increase with long-term
use, which may occur in as high as 30% of treated cats, leading to failure of
treatment.
Contraindications and Precautions
Stop therapy with epoetin when joint pain, fever, anorexia, or cutaneous
reactions are observed.
Drug Interactions
 No interactions are reported.
Instructions for Use
The use of epoetin alpha has been limited primarily to dogs and cats. The only form
currently available is a human recombinant product. It is used in animals when

including Enterobacteriaceae. Ertapenem is not as active against Pseudomonas
aeruginosa as other carbapenems. It is also active against most gram-positive
bacteria, except methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcns and Enterococcus. In
people the half-life is longer than other carbapenems (4 hours) because of high
protein binding (95%), which allows for less frequent dosing. However, in dogs
these advantages do not exist. The protein binding in dogs is 46%, the volume of
distribution is 0.28 L/kg, and the half-life is only 1.3 hours.
Indications and Clinical Use
Ertapenem is indicated primarily for resistant infections caused by bacteria
resistant to other drugs. It may be valuable for treating resistant infections
caused by Escherichia coli and Klebsiello pnenmonine. The use of ertapenem has not
been as common as for meropenem or imipenem. High protein binding and long
carbapenems. However, dosing protocols have not been tested in dogs
and cats.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Carbapenems pose similar risks as other beta-lactam antibiotics, but adverse
effects are rare. There is a risk of CNS toxicity (seizures and tremors) with high
doses.
Contraindications and Precautions
Some slight yellowish discoloration may occur after reconstitution. Slight
discoloration will not affect potency. However, a darker amber or brown
discoloration may indicate oxidation and loss of potency.
Drug Interactions
Do not mix in vial or syringe with other antibiotics.
288  Erythromycin
Instructions for Use
Doses in animals have been based on extrapolation from human studies rather than
efficacy trials.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Susceptibility testing: CLSI break points for sensitive organisms are <4 mcg/mL for
all organisms. Most bacteria have a MIC less than 2 mcg/mL. Sensitivity to
imipenem can be used as a marker for ertapenem.
Formulations
Ertapenem is available in a l-g vial for injection.
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature.

Erythromycin
eh-rith-roe-mye'sin
Trade and Other Names: Gallimycin-100, Gallimycin-200, Erythro-100, and
generic brands
Functional Classification: Antibacternial
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Macrolide antibiotic. Like other macrolides, it inhibits bacteria by binding to
the 50S ribosome and inhibiting protein synthesis. The spectrum of activity of
erythromycin is limited primarily to gram-positive aerobic bacteria; it has little or no
effect on gram-negative bacteria. The spectrum of activity also includes mycoplasma.
In cattle, it is also active against respiratory pathogens such as Pasteurelln mnltocidn,
Mannheimia haemolytica,and Histophilus somni(formerly Haemophilus somnus).
Erythromycin effects on gastrointestinal motility are via stimulation of motilin
receptors to increase smooth muscle activity. In dogs the half-life is 1.3 hours IV
and 2.9 hours oral, with only 1l% bioavailability. In cats, the half-life is less than
1 hour.
Indications and Clinical Uses
s s d so s  a se s
infections caused by gram-positive bacteria, and skin and respiratory infections. In
foals it is used to treat Rhodococcns eqn? pneumonia, often in combination with
Erythromycin289
rifampin. In some species, including horses, it has been used at low doses to
stimulate intestinal motility but demonstration of this activity has been limited in
clinical patients. In horses the dose of erythromycin to stimulate GI motility is lower
than the antibactenial dose (l mg/kg), but the clinical efficacy for this use has not
been shown. In experimental calves, 8.8 mg/kg IM significantly increased rumen
motility. At a dose of l0 mg/kg IM in cows undergoing surgery for LDA, it
increased rumen contractions.
The use of erythromycin has diminished because of decreased availability of some
dose forms (erythromycin estolate), adverse effects in small animals (vomiting), short
half-life that requires frequent dosing, and diarrhea in horses. Other macrolides
(e.g., azithromycin and clarithromycin in small animals and horses, and tilmicosin
and tulathromycin in cattle) are used more often instead of erythromycin.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Diarrhea in large animals is the most common adverse effect. This is believed to
be caused by a disruption of the normal bacterial intestinal flora. This is caused
usually from oral administration. Nursing mares have developed diarrhea through
exposure to treated foals. Hyperthermia (febrile syndrome) in association with
erythromycin treatment has been observed in foals.
In small animals the most common side effect is vomiting (probably caused by
cholinergic-like effect or motilin-induced motility). In small animals, it also may
cause diarrhea. In rodents and rabbits, the diarrhea caused by erythromycin can
be senous and even fatal.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not administer orally to rodents or rabbits. Do not administer erythromycin
solutions intended for intramuscular administration by intravenous injection.
 Only the gluceptate and lactobionate salts should be used intravenously
(gluceptate rarely available).
Drug Interactions
Erythromycin, like other macrolides, is known to inhibit the cytochrome P450
enzymes and may decrease the metabolism of other coadministered drugs. See
Appendix.
Instructions for Use
There are several foms of erythromycin, including the ethylsuccinate and
estolate esters and stearate salt for oral administration. However, the estolate form
is only available as a suspension. There are no convincing data to suggest that
one form is absorbed better than another, and dosage is included for all. Only

had high efficacy (95%), but it had serious adverse effects and is not recommended.
Estradiol cypionate is longer acting and more potent than other estrogen
fomulations.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Estradiol has a high risk of causing endometrial hyperplasia and pyometra. There
Estradiol cypionate injections have produced leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and
fatal aplastic anemia. Because stem cells can be affected, the bone marrow toxicity
may not be reversible.
Contraindications and Precautions

Trade and Other Names: Theelol (previously called Oestriol), Incurin (Europe)
Functional Classification: Hormone
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Estriol is an estrogen hormone. It differs from DES or other estrogens because it is
naturally occurring and occupies the receptor for a shorter duration compared to
synthetic compounds. When used to treat urinary incontinence, its effects are
believed to be caused by increasing sensitivity of alpha-adrenergic receptors in
uninary smooth muscle.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Estriol is an estrogen replacement. In small animals, it has most often been used to
treat urinary incontinence that is associated with estrogen deficiency. Success rate
may be limited. Estriol has increased sphincter tone in urethra of female dogs but
has limited effcacy when used in clinical treatment.

Etidronate Disodium
eh-tih-droe'nate dye-soe'dee-um
Trade and Other Names: Didronel
Functional Classification: Antihypercalcemic agent
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Bisphosphonate drug. These drugs are a group of drugs characterized by a germinal
bisphosphonate bond. They slow the formation and dissolution of hydroxyapatite
cystals. Their clinical use resides in their ability to inhibit bone resorption. These
drugs decrease bone tumover by inhibiting osteoclast activity and retard bone
resorption and decrease rate of osteoporosis.
Indications and Clinical Uses
The bisphosphonate group of drugs, which includes etidronate, is used primarily in
used to decrease calcium in conditions that cause hypercalcemia, such as cancer and
vitamin D toxicosis. Studies in people have shown that bisphosphonates may have
action in cancer-induced bone disease that is more significant than the effect on
osteolysis and bone resorption and also may decrease the tumor burden. Drugs in
this class include pamidronate, etidronate, and pyrophosphate. In dogs, more
experimental work has been performed with pamidronate than other drugs in this
group. Some bisphosphonates have been used to treat navicular disease in horses,
but this work is only preliminary and used injectable formulations.

Etodolac
ee-toe'doe-lak
Trade and Other Names: EtoGesic (veterinary preparation) and Lodine (human
preparation)
Functional Classification: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)
296 Etodolac
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Like other NSAIDs, etodolac has analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects by
inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins. The enzyme inhibited by NSAID is the
cyclo-oxygenase enzyme (COX). The COX enzyme exists in two isoforms: COX-1
and COX-2. COX-1 is primarily responsible for synthesis of prostaglandins
important for maintaining a healthy GI tract, renal function, platelet function,
and other normal functions. COX-2 is induced and responsible for synthesizing
prostaglandins that are important mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever.
However, it is known that there is some crossover of COX-1 and COX-2 effects in
some situations; and COX-2 activity is important for some biological effects. In
dogs, etodolac has a half-life of 7.6 to 14 hours, depending on the study and
feeding conditions. In dogs it shows either little preference of COX-2 or COX-1
(nonselective) or slight COX-2 selectivity in vitro. It is not known if selectivity for
COX-2 affects efficacy or risk of adverse effects. In horses, etodolac is relatively
COX-2 selective and is more potent than in dogs. The half-life in horses is only 3
hours, but a duration of effect of approximately 24 hours has been observed in
horses with lameness.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Etodolac is indicated for treatment of osteoarthritis in dogs. It also is used as an
analgesic and may be used for other painful conditions. Like other NSAIDs,
etodolac is expected to reduce fever. Uses in cats have not been established.
Etodolac has been used in some horses to relieve pain associated with abdominal
surgery and to treat lameness (e.g., caused by navicular disease). Dose regimens are
dfferent for horses compared with other animals.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
NSAIDs may cause GI ulceration. Other adverse effects caused by NSAIDs
include decreased platelet function and renal injury. In clinical trials with etodolac
at recommended doses, some dogs showed weight loss, loose stools, or diarrhea.
S         s  
Etodolac has been associated with keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) in dogs, which
in some cases has been severe. Resolution of KCS has occurred in only l0%-15%
of cases after discontinuing medication. Improvement in KCS was greater if
treatment duration was short. In horses, at high doses GI toxicity has been
observed.
Contraindications and Precautions
 Do not administer to animals prone to GI ulcers. Do not administer with other
ulcerogenic drugs, such as corticosteroids. Do not administer to dogs that may
be prone to developing KCS. Do not administer to animal with compromised
renal function.
Drug Interactions
Use NSAIDs cautiously with other drugs known to cause GI injury (e.g.,
corticosteroids). The efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
inhibitors and diuretics {firosemide) may be diminished when administered
concurrently with NSAIDs. Etodolac may cross-react with sulfonamides in
sensitive animals.
Etodolac297
Instructions for Use
Administer as directed and avoid concurrent use of other medications that may
increase GI toxicity. Most of the use in dogs has been associated with treatment of
Osteoarthritis. In horses, it has been shown experimentally to improve lameness
associated with navicular disease. When used in horses for this purpose, it was given
at 23 mg/kg orally once or twice daily for 3 days. Treated horses improved with
either regimen and showed no signs of adverse effects. Experimental horses treated
with 20 or 23 mg/kg did not demonstrate adverse effects, but long-term safety has
not been reported.
F
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor for signs of GI ulcers and bleeding. Monitor tear production periodically in
dogs treated with etodolac and observe for ocular signs of KCS. Monitor liver
enzymes in dogs treated with NSAIDs periodically for signs of liver toxicosis.
Monitor urea nitrogen and creatinine in treated animals for signs of renal injury.
Etodolac has had varying effects on T4, free T4, and TSH concentrations in dogs.
One study showed no effect, and another study showed a decrease in T4 and free
T4 in treated dogs after 2 weeks.

 n ry e au on n si uoe au ' e I a s say i
thymidine kinase (TK), which converts penciclovir into penciclovir triphosphate,
which inhibits viral DNA polymerase to prevent DNA chain elongation—thus
inhibiting viral DNA chain elongation. It is used for treatment of various forms of
herpes virus infection in humans and also has been used for treatment of viral
infections in animals. However, feline herpes virus 1 (FHVl) is resistant to acyclovir
and valciclovir, and studies are lacking on the susceptibility of other herpes viruses.
Other antiviral drugs used in animals include acyclovir, penciclovir, and valacyclovir.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Although in vitro testing does not indicate high activity against the virus, famciclovir
has been used to treat feline herpes virus (FHVl) associated with conjunctivitis,
rhinosinusitis, keratitis, and FHVl-associated dermatitis. In treated cats there was
improvement of conjunctivitis, decreased conjunctival inflammation, decreased
ocular discomfort, and decreased tearing.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
No adverse effects were identified in limited studies performed in cats.
Contraindications and Precautions
Reduce dose in animals with compromised renal function.
Drug Interactions
No interaction identified.
Instructions for Use
The dose listed for cats is based on limited studies in which 62.5 mg per cat was
studied initially, but later evidence suggested that a higher dose of 125 mg per cat
was more effective.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor BUN and creatinine during use.

Regulatory Information
Because of mutagenicity, it should not be administered to animals intended for food.
Famotidine
fah-moe'tih-deen
Trade and Other Names: Pepcid
Functional Classification: Antiulcer agent
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Histaminez antagonist (H2 blocker). Stimulation of acid secretion in the stomach
and muscarinic receptors. Famotidine and related Hz blockers inhibit the action of
histamine on the histamine H2 receptor of parietal cells and inhibits gastric parietal
cell gastric acid secretion. It increases stomach pH to help heal and prevent gastric
and duodenal ulcers.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Famotidine, like other H2-receptor blockers, is used to treat ulcers and gastritis in a
variety of animals. Although it is often used for animals with vomiting, there are no
efficacy data to indicate that it is effective. There are no efficacy data to support its
use for preventing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced bleeding
and ulcers. Famotidine has been used by veterinarians as a preferred H, blocker, but
there is a lack of evidence to demonstrate superiority over other drugs in this class.
Some studies have demonstrated efficacy at l mg/kg in dogs, while other studies
have not demonstrated differences between a placebo in dogs for increasing stomach
pH.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects usually are seen only with decreased renal clearance. In people,
CNS signs may occur with high doses. The intravenous solution contains benzyl
alcohol, aspartic acid, and mannitol. Give intravenous injections slowly to cats
(over 5 minutes) because rapid intravenous injections may cause hemolysis.
Contraindications and Precautions
Intravenous solutions contain benzyl alcohol. IV injections to small animals,
especially cats, should be done slowly.
Drug Interactions
Famotidine and other H2-receptor blockers block secretion of stomach acid.
Therefore, they will interfere with oral absorption of drugs dependent on acidity,
such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, and iron supplements. Unlike cimetidine,
famotidine is not associated with inhibition of microsomal P450 enzymes.
300   Febantel
Instructions for Use
Administer with food for best absorption. Clinical studies for famotidine have not
been performed; therefore optimal doses for ulcer prevention and healing are not
known. Dose recommendations are extrapolated from human use or from anecdotal
experience. Experimental studies in dogs have shown that doses of 0.1-0.2 mg/kg
inhibit stomach acid secretion, but other clinical studies have shown that doses of
1.0 mg/kg suppress stomach acid for 24 hours. For intravenous use, dilute with IV
solutions (e.g., 0.9% saline) to a total volume of 5-10 mL.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
No specific monitoring is necessary.

Felbamate
fel'bah-mate
Trade and Other Names: Felbatol
Functional Classification: Anticonvulsant
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Anticonvulsant. The action to treat seizures in animals may be via antagonism at the
N-methyl- D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and block effects of excitatory amino acids.
The half-life in dogs is 5-6 hours, which may require frequent administration.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Felbamate is used to treat epilepsy in dogs when they are refractory to other
anticonvulsants. It has been used in conjunction with other anticonvulsants. However,
the use in animals has declined because of the availability of other drugs to treat
refractory seizures such as levetiracetam, zonisamide, gabapentin, and pregabalin.
Precautionary information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Not documented with use in dogs. In people the most severe reactions have been
hepatotoxicity and aplastic anemia.
Contraindications and Precautions
It may increase phenobarbital concentrations.
Drug Interactions
Possible interactions exist with drugs that either alter or are substrates for hepatic
cytochrome P450 enzymes. See Appendix. It may increase phenobarbital
concentrations if used concurrently.
Fenbendazole 303
Instructions for Use
Dosing has been empirically in dogs. There are no controlled studies to document
effcacy, but it is usually administered when animals have been refractory to other
dnugs, such as phenobarbital or bromide.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitoring of plasma concentrations is helpful to assess therapy. Assays may be
available in some commercial laboratories. Ideal plasma concentrations have not
been established for animals. However, concentrations in humans of 24 to
137 mcg/mL in plasma have been effective (mean of 78 mcg/mL).

Fenbendazole
fen-ben'dah-zole
Trade and Other Names: Panacur and SafeGuard
Functional Classification: Antiparasitic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Benzimidazole antiparasitic drug. Like other benzimidazoles, fenbendazole produces
a degeneration of the parasite microtubule and irreversibly blocks glucose uptake in
eventually resulting in death. However, there is no effect on glucose metabolism in
mammals.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Fenbendazole is effective for treatment of numerous helminth intestinal parasites in
animals, including Toxncarn, Toxascaris, Ancylostomn, and Trichuris. In dogs it is
304 Fenbendazole
effective for most intestinal helminth parasites and also against nematodes.
Fenbendazole has been effective for treatment of Giardin, but
higher doses are needed and there may be failure rates as high as 50%. It is effective
in cats for treatment of lungworms, flukes, and a variety of helminth parasites.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
It has a good safety margin, but vomiting and diarhea have been reported. When
evaluated at doses of three and five times the recommended dose at three times the
recommended duration, fenbendazole was well tolerated and no adverse effects
were reported. It has been safe to use during pregnancy. There have been rare
reports of pancytopenia associated with fenbendazole administration.
Contraindications and Precautions
No known contraindications. It may be used in all ages of animals.
Drug Interactions
There are no known drug interactions.
Instructions for Use
 Dose recommendations based on clinical studies by manufacturer. Granules may be
mixed with food. Paste may be given to horses and cattle. Presence of food does not
affect oral absorption. In studies for treatment of Giardin, it was safer than other
treatments.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests

Fenoldopam mesylate
fe-nol'- doe- pam
Trade and Other Names: Corlopam
Functional Classification: Vasodilator
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Fenoldopam is a dopamine agonist. It is specific for the dopamine D, receptors and
therefore has been used to produce smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation in
vascular beds that have D, receptors. It has no activity on Dz receptors and only a
small effect on alpha-adrenergic receptors. Because of this activity, fenoldopam has
more specificity than dopamine, which has been used for similar indications. The use
of fenoldopam is usually confined to increasing renal perfusion to treat acute renal
failure. The half-life in animals is very short (1-7 minutes in dogs), so it is usually
administered via constant rate infision.
Indications and Clinical Uses
The use of fenoldopam in veterinary medicine is limited to a few research studies
(primarily in cats) and some anecdotal evidence of efficacy for treating acute renal
failure. The use in people is to treat severe hypertension, to prevent renal ischermia, to
increase gastrointestinal perfusion, and to treat acute renal failure. The use is limited
to short-term in-hospital use when rapid treatment of hypertension is needed.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
The most common side effect is hypotension. The half-life of fenoldopam is
short; therefore, if hypotension is observed, decrease the infusion rate. Other
adverse effects have not been described for small animals. In people adverse
effects can include increased intraocular pressure (risk in glaucoma), low
potassium, and tachycardia.
Contraindications and Precautions
No known contraindications.
Drug Interactions
Use cautiously with other vasodilators; excessive hypotension can occus. Do not
use with beta blockers.
Instructions for Use
Administer by constant rate infusion (CRI). Do not administer bolus doses. Onset of
effects should occur within 15 minutes of starting the CRI. Dose recommendations
are based on some limited research studies and anecdotal clinical expenience from
306Fentanyl Citrate
veterinarians. There have been no well-controlled studies of efficacy in animals, and
the use is largely extrapolated from human recommendations. It is recommended that
the solution is added to fluids to make a 40-mcg/mL solution for infusion. For
example, add 1 mL (10 mg) to 250 mL.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor patient's heart rate and blood pressure during treatment.
Formulations Available
Fenoldopam is available as a 10-mg/mL injection. The pH range is 2.8 to 3.8.
Stability and Storage
Fenoldopam solution can be mixed with sodium chloride solution (0.9%) or 5%
dextrose solution for infusion. Once mixed in fluids, it is stable under normal
ambient light and temperature conditions for at least 24 hours. After 24 hours,
discard the solution.

Fentanyl Citrate
fen'tah-nil sih'trate 
Trade and Other Names: Sublimaze and generic brands; Fentora buccal tablets
Functional Classification: Analgesic, Opioid
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
d  s oe  g de  pg is do 
than morphine. Fentanyl is an agonist for the mu-opiate receptors on nerves and
inhibits release of neurotransmitters involved with transmission of pain stimuli (such
as Substance P). The central sedative and euphoric effects are related to mu-receptor
effects in the brain. Fentanyl has a wide safety profile with doses as high as 300
times the recommended dose not being lethal in spontaneously breathing dogs. It is
highly lipophilic—-approximately 1000 times more lipophilic than morphine, which
produces rapid diffusion into the CNS. In dogs the half-life is approximately 3-6
hours, and in cats it is approximately 2.5 hours. Clearance is high in dogs and oral
absorption is very low. Fentanyl can be absorbed from the skin or oral mucous
membrane, but it is not orally bioavailable if swallowed.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Fentanyl citrate is used as an intravenous bolus or as a constant rate infusion
combination with other CNS sedatives. Fentanyl administered IV will produce
Fentanyl Citrate307
antinociceptive effects for approximately 2 hours. Most of the doses are based on
empinicism and experimental studies. Oral buccal tablets have been used in people
with this use in animals. See Fentanyl, Transdermal for information about
transdermal form. Clinical use is primarily in dogs and cats. In horses at doses
needed to produce analgesia it is associated with a high degree of restlessness,
tachycardia, increased locomotor activity, and excitement (see Adverse Reactions and
Side Effects section). In horses there has been poor efficacy at lower doses.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Fentanyl has adverse effects similar to morphine. Like all opiates, side effects are
predictable and unavoidable. Side effects include sedation, constipation, and
bradycardia. Respiratory depression occurs with high doses. As with other
opiates, a slight decrease in heart rate is expected. In most cases this decrease
does not have to be treated with anticholinergic drugs (e.g., atropine), but it
should be monitored. In horses, undesirable and even dangerous behavior can
follow rapid intravenous opioid administration. Horses should receive a
Contraindications and Precautions
Fentanyl citrate is a Schedule II controlled substance. Tolerance and dependence
occurs with repeated administration. Cats and horses are prone to excitement
after administration, especially IV.
Drug Interactions
Instructions for Use
 No clinical studies have been reported. In addition to fentanyl injection, transdermal
fentanyl is available. Oral transmucosal (buccal) forms and soluble muco-adhesive

Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor analgesic response. Monitor patient's heart rate and respiration. Although
bradycardia rarely needs to be treated when it is caused by an opioid, atropine can
be administered if necessary. If serious respiratory depression occurs, the opioid can
be reversed with naloxone.
FormulationsAvailable
Fentanyl citrate is available as a 250-mcg/5 mL injection (50 mcg/mL). Fentora
buccal tablets are 100, 200, 400, 600, and 800 mcg. Fentanyl buccal soluble film
(Onsolis) is 200, 400, 600, 800, and 1200 mcg per film strip.
StabilityandStorage
Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature. It
is soluble in water and slightly soluble in alcohol. It is a Schedule II drug, so store
in a locked compartment. Compounded into a transmucosal gel has not been
effective. The pH of fentanyl citrate is 5.2. If bicarbonate solution is added (l:l0 or
1:20 dilution) the pH increases to 8.0, which may decrease pain from injection if
injected immediately after mixing.

Fentanyl, Transdermal
fen'tah-nil
Trade and Other Names: Duragesic
Functional Classification: Analgesic, Opioid
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Synthetic opiate analgesic. Fentanyl is approximately 80 to 100 times more potent
than morphine. Fentanyl is an agonist for the mu-opiate receptors on nerves and
inhibits release of neurotransmitters involved with transmission of pain stimuli (such
as Substance P). The central sedative and euphoric effects are related to mu-receptor
effects in the brain. The fentanyl transdermal system delivers fentanyl through the
skin at a constant rate to produce systemic effects. Absorption is determined by the
surface area for absorption.
Patches are available that deliver 25, 50, 75, and 100 mcg/hr. Absorption can
be variable in animals (e.g., rate of release of fentanyl has varied from 27% to 98%
[mean 7l%] of the theoretical value). Cats absorbed the fentanyl at an average rate
of approximately one third that of the theoretical delivery rate, but one patch will
maintain consistent concentrations of fentanyl in the plasma for at least ll8 hours.
Fentanyl transdermal patches (two or three l00-mcg/hr patches) have been applied
Indications and Clinical Uses
Transdermal absorption and effective plasma concentrations have been demonstrated
for cats, dogs, horses, and goats. Fentanyl transdermal has the same properties as
fentanyl citrate administered IV, except in this formulation it is administered

F
signs of opiate overdose may occur (e.g., excitement in cats or sedation in dogs);
however, these reactions are rare. Adverse effects have not been reported from
the use in horses. If adverse effects are observed in animals (e.g., respiratory
depression, excess sedation, or excitement in cats), remove patch and, if
necessary, administer naloxone.
Contraindications and Precautions
Transdermal fentanyl is a Schedule II controlled substance. Use cautiously in
animals of small body weight (e.g., small toy dogs and young or debilitated cats).
Animal owners should be advised of the high risks to humans if transdermal
patches are applied to humans. Fentanyl is absorbed through intact human skin.
Drug Interactions
There are no specific drug interactions, but transdermal fentanyl will decrease
other anesthetic requirements. Transdermal fentanyl will potentiate other opiates
and CNS depressants.
Instructions for Use
Transdermal fentanyl incorporates fentanyl into adhesive patches applied to skin of
dogs and cats. Studies have determined that patches release sustained levels of
fentanyl for 72-108 hours in dogs and cats. One l00-mcg/hr patch is equivalent to
10 mg/kg of morphine every 4 hours IM. Studies have determined that 25-mcg/hr

Firocoxib
feer-oh-koks'ib
Trade and Other Names: Previcox and Equioxx
Functional Classification: Anti-inflammatory
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Frocoxib is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Like other drugs in
this class, firocoxib produces analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting
the synthesis of prostaglandins. The enzyme inhibited by NSAID is the cyclo-
oxygenase (COX) enzyme. The COX enzyme exists in two isoforms: COX-1 and
 COX-2. COX-1 is primarily responsible for synthesis of prostaglandins important for
maintaining a healthy GI tract, renal function, platelet function, and other normal
functions. COX-2 is induced and responsible for synthesizing prostaglandins that are
important mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever. However, it is known whether
there is some crossover of COX-l and COX-2 effects in some situations, and
COX-2 activity is important for some biological effects. Firocoxib, using in vitro
assays, is more COX-l sparing compared to older NSAIDs and is a selective
s    r si  i-  - g 
indicating that frocoxib is a selective COX-2 inhibitor in dogs, horses, and cats. It
has not been established if the specificity for COX-l or COX-2 is related to effcacy
oOr safety. Firocoxib has a halflife of 7.8 hours in dogs, 9-12 hours in cats, and
30-40 hours in horses. It is highly protein bound (96%-98%). Oral absorption is
38% in dogs, 79% in horses, and 54%-70% in cats. Feeding delays absorption but
 does not diminish overall absorption. In horses, oral absorption is 79%, with oral
paste at a dose of 0.l mg/kg.
Firocoxib313
Indications and Clinical Uses
Firocoxib is used to decrease pain, inflammation, and fever. It has been used for
most common uses is osteoarthritis, but it also has been used for pain associated
with surgery. In horses it is used for osteoarthritis. In cats, frocoxib has been
demonstrated to be effective for attenuating acute febrile responses. Use in cats is
limited to short-term use or long-term use at low doses.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
GI problems are the most common adverse events associated with NSAIDs and can
include vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, ulcers, and erosions of the GI tract. Both acute
F
and long-term safety and efficacy have been established for dogs. In field trials,
vomiting was the most often reported adverse effect. In studies performed in dogs,
higher doses (five times dose) caused GI problems. In horses, mucosal recovery
after intestinal ischemia was less than other non-selective NSAIDs. In studies of
young juvenile dogs, administration of frocoxib was associated with periportal fatty
hepatic changes in some animals. Renal toxicity, especially in dehydrated animals or
animals with preexisting renal disease, has been observed for some NSAIDs.
Behavior changes have occurred in dogs and horses, but they are rare.
In horses, gastrointestinal problems (diarrhea, loose stool) have been reported
 in field trials, but they are rare at approved doses. At doses exceeding labeled
dose or duration in horses, ulcers, azotemia, renal injury, erosions of skin and
oral mucosa, and prolonged bleeding times have been observed.
Contraindications and Precautions
Dogs and cats with preexisting GI problems or renal problems may be at a
 greater risk of adverse effects from NSAIDs. There is no information on the
safety of frocoxib in the treatment of breeding, pregnant, or lactating animals,
but adverse effects have not been reported in breeding animals.
 In horses, do not exceed recommended duration of treatment. During animal
safety studies in horses, toxicity occurred at recommended doses if administration
exceeded 30 days.
Drug Interactions
Do not administer with other NSAIDs or with corticosteroids. Corticosteroids
have been shown to exacerbate the GI adverse effects. Some NSAIDs may
   s  go e   
(ACE) inhibitors.
Instructions for Use
 Use according to manufacturer's dosing guidelines. Chewable tablets can be
administered with or without food. Long-term studies have not been completed in
cats, and only single-dose studies have been reported.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor GI signs for evidence of diarrhea, GI bleeding, or ulcers. Because of risk of
renal injury, monitor renal parameters (water consumption, BUN, creatinine, and

Florfenicol
flore-fen'ih-kole
Trade and Other Names: Nuflor, Nuflor Gold, Resflor (flunixin and florfenicol)
Aquaflor (fish form)
Functional Classification: Antibacterial
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Florfenicol is a thiamphenicol derivative with the same mechanism of action as
chloramphenicol {inhibition of protein synthesis). However, it is more active than
either chloramphenicol or thiamphenicol. Florfenicol has a broad spectrum of
antibacterial activity that includes all organisms sensitive to chloramphenicol,
 gram-negative bacilli, gram-positive cocci, and other atypical bacteria such as
mycoplasma. Florfenicol is highly lipophilic, which provides high enough
(penetration across the blood-brain barrier in cattle is 46%). The half-life of
florfenicol is 2-3 hours in cattle after IV administration, but it is prolonged (18
hours) after IM injection. In dogs the half-life is shorter, with values of 1.1 and 1.2
after IV and oral administration, respectively. The half-life in cats is approximately
4 hours and 7.8 hours after IV and oral administration, respectively.
Indicationsand ClinicalUses
 Because florfenicol is a derivative of chloramphenicol, it has been used in situations
in which chloramphenicol is unavailable or illegal. (Chloramphenicol is illegal to use
in food animals in the United States.) Florfenicol has been shown to be effective for
treatment of bovine respiratory disease (BRD) in cattle associated with Mannheimin
haemolyticn,Pastenreliamnitocidn,andHistophiinssomni(formerlyHaemophiins
somnns). Administration of florfenicol (40 mg/kg once SQ) at time of arrival to the
feedlot decreased the incidence of BRD. It also is used for treatment of bovine

the same Bovine Respiratory Disease pathogens and provides anti-inflammatory
activity with the addition of flunixin meglumine, including BRD-associated pyrexia
in beef and non-lactating dairy cattle.
In pigs it is used for treatment of swine respiratory disease (SRD) caused by

and Streptococcns swis. In cats, effective concentrations can be achieved with twice-
daily administration. In dogs, the half-life is short and frequent administration is 
necessary to produce effective concentrations. Florfenicol also has been administered
to fish. There is a feed-additive fommulation that also has been approved for catfish
(10 mg/kg).
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Use in dogs and cats has been limited; therefore, adverse effects have not been
reported. Chloramphenicol has been linked to dose-dependent bone marrow
depression and similar reactions may be possible with florfenicol. However, there
does not appear to be a risk of aplastic anemia as for chloramphenicol. At high
doses, forfenicol may cause testicular degeneration. In horses, doses of 20 mg/
kg q48h IM changed the bacterial flora and increased risk of diarrhea.
Contraindications and Precautions
Long-tem use in animals may cause bone marrow suppression. Administration to
horses has caused diarrhea, colitis, and elevations in bilirubin. Administration to
horses is not recommended. Do not administer more than l0 mL in a single site
Drug Interactions
 No drug interactions are reported for animals. However, chloramphenicol is well
known to inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes and decrease metabolism of other
drugs (see Appendix). Therefore, it is possible, but not documented, that
florfenicol could cause drug interactions.
Instructions for Use
 Dose form is only approved for use in cattle and pigs, and doses listed have not been
thoroughly evaluated in small animals. Doses listed are derived from pharmacokinetic
studies. Sustained effect in cattle from intramuscular and subcutaneous administration
does not appear to be long lasting in dogs. Injectable formulation for cattle has been
administered, if necessary, orally to small animals, but the taste is bitter.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor CBC for evidence of bone marrow depression. Susceptibility testing:
laboratories have used chloramphenicol to test for susceptibility to florfenicol. CLSI
break points for sensitive organisms are ≤4 mcg/mL for streptococci and ≤8 mcg/
mL for other organisms.
Formulations
Florfenicol is available in 300-mg/mL injectable solution (cattle), or 23-mg/mL
solution to be added to drinking water for pigs (400 mg per gallon). Medicated
feed formulation contains 500 g/kg to be added to fish feed. Flunixin is combined
with florfenicol in Resflor Gold, which has 300 mg florfenicol and 16.5 mg flunixin
per mL with vehicles of 2-pyrolidone, 35 mg malic acid, and triacetin.

Fluconazole
floo-kahn'ah-zole
Trade and Other Names: Diflucan and generic brands
Functional Classification: Antifungal
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Azole antifungal drug. Fungistatic. Fluconazole inhibits ergosterol synthesis in
fungal cell membrane and has activity against dermatophytes, systemic fungi, and
yeasts, including Candidn, Coccidioides, and Cryptococcus spp.. However, it has weak
activity against molds such as Aspergillus or Zygomycetes. Compared to other oral
azole antifungals, fluconazole is absorbed more predictably and completely, even on
an empty stomach. The half-life in dogs, cats, and horses is approximately 14-15,
13-25, and 38 hours, respectively.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Fluconazole is effective against dermatophytes, yeasts, and a variety of systemic fungi.
In dogs, cats, horses, and exotic animals, it is used to treat systemic fungal infections,
Fluconazole 317
yeast infections, and dermatophytes, including Malassezin dermatitis. In cats it has
been used to treat Cryptococcns. In dogs, it is not as active against coccidioidomycosis
as other azole antifungal drugs, but it has been effective in some patients. Higher
doses may be needed (e.g., 10 mg/kg q12h) for coccidioidomycosis. Because it is
water soluble, it has been used to treat fungal cystitis.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects have not been reported from fluconazole administration
Compared to ketoconazole, it has less effect on endocrine function. However,
increased liver enzyme concentrations and hepatopathy are possible.
F
Contraindications and Precautions
Use cautiously in pregnant animals. At high doses in laboratory animals, it has
caused fetal abnormalities.
Drug Interactions
Fluconazole can be an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 enzymes, which can
      i '   
concentrations in dogs. It may also cause other reactions as a result of inhibition
of metabolizing enzymes.
Instructions for Use
 Doses for fluconazole are primarily based on studies performed in cats for treatment
of cryptococcosis. Effcacy for other infections has not been reported. The primary
difference between fluconazole and other azoles is that fluconazole attains higher
concentrations in the CNS. Oral absorption of fluconazole is more predictable than
itraconazole and ketoconazole and less affected by fasting.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor hepatic enzymes periodically in treated animals. Susceptibility testing is
possible, but ranges are only established for Candido.
Formulations
Fluconazole is available in 50-, 100-, 150-, and 200-mg tablets, 10- and 40-mg/mL
oral suspension, and 2-mg/mL intravenous injection.

Regulatory Information
No withdrawal times are established for animals that are intended for food
(extralabel use).
Fludrocortisone Acetate
floo-droe-kor'tih-sone assih-tate
Trade and Other Names: Florinef
Functional Classification: Corticosteroid
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Mineralocorticoid replacement therapy. Fludrocortisone has high potency of
mineralocorticoid activity compared to glucocorticoid activity. Fludrocortisone acts
to mimic the action of aldosterone in the body, specifically to increase reabsorption
of sodium in renal tubules.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Fludrocortisone is used as replacement therapy in animals with adrenocortical
insufficiency (Addison's disease). Because of its glucocorticosteroid activity, some
animals may not require additional supplementation with glucocorticoids when
administering fludrocortisone. Desoxycorticosterone pivalate (DOCP) is used as an
alternative in dogs when an intermittent injectable is desired rather than daily oral
doses of fludrocortisone.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects are primarily related to glucocorticoid effects with high doses.
hypoadrenocorticism may result in glucocorticoid side effects. Administration of
fludrocortisone causes a significant reduction in urine aldosterone.
Contraindications and Precautions
Although used as a mineralocorticoid, it may produce glucocorticoid side effects.
Use cautiously in animals that may be at risk for corticosteroid side effects
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions are reported for animals.
Instructions for Use
Dose should be adjusted by monitoring patient response (i.e., monitoring
electrolyte concentrations). In some patients, it is administered with a glucocorticoid
and sodium supplementation (e.g. prednisolone/prednisone at a dose of 0.2-
0.3 mg/kg/day).
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor patient's electrolytes (especially sodium and potassium). Dose adjustment
should be based on electrolyte monitoring to maintain these within a desired range.

Flumazenil
floo-may'zeh-nil
Trade and Other Names: Romazicon
Functional Classification: Antidote
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. Flumazenil blocks the action of
benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, from the action on the GABA receptor.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Flumazenil has no therapeutic benefits of its own, but it is used as a reversal agent
after benzodiazepine administration in people (not commonly used in veterinary
medicine). Because of high first-pass effects, it cannot be administered orally; it must
be injected.

Flumethasone
floo-meth'ah-sone
Trade and Other Names: Flucort
Functional Classification: Corticosteroid
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Potent glucocorticoid anti-inflammatory drug. Potency is listed by one reference as
approximately 15 times that of cortisol and in veterinary references as 30 times that
of cortisol and 6 to 7 times the potency of prednisolone. Anti-inflammatory effects
are complex but primarily via inhibition of inflammatory cells and suppression of
expression of inflammatory mediators. Use is for treatment of inflammatory and
immune-mediated disease.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Flumethasone, like other corticosteroids, is used to treat a variety of inflammatory
and immune-mediated diseases. The dosing section contains the range of doses for
replacement therapy, anti-inflammatory therapy, and immunosuppressive therapy.
Flumethasone is used more often in large animals than small animals. Large-animal
uses include treatment of inflammatory conditions, especially musculoskeletal
disorders. In horses, flumethasone has been used for treatment of recurrent airway
In cattle, corticosteroids have been used in the treatment of ketosis.
322 Flumethasone
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Side effects from corticosteroids are many and include polyphagia, polydipsia/
effects include GI ulceration, hepatopathy, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, decreased
thyroid homone, decreased protein synthesis, and delayed wound healing
and immunosuppression. Secondary infections can occur as a result of
immunosuppression and include demodicosis, toxoplasmosis, fungal infections,
and U'TIs. In horses, additional adverse effects include risk of laminitis.
Contraindications and Precautions
Use cautiously in patients prone to ulcers or infection and in animals in which
wound healing is necessary. Use cautiously in animals with renal failure or
diabetes and in pregnant animals.
Drug Interactions
Administration of corticosteroids with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) will increase the risk of GI injury.
Instructions for Use
Doses are based on severity of underlying disease. For example, anti-inflammatory
conditions require lower doses than immune-mediated conditions. For all
conditions, cats often require higher doses than dogs. Note that the approved
label dose for cattle and horses is in the range of l.25 to 5 mg per animal or
approximately 0.003-0.006 mg/kg (3-6 mcg/kg) for an adult animal. Considering
that the potency of flumethasone may be similar to dexamethasone, many experts
feel that the dose should be higher, in the range of 0.04 0.15 mg/kg.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor liver enzymes, blood glucose, and renal function during therapy. Monitor
patients for signs of secondary infections. Perform an adrenocorticotropic hormone
(ACTH) stimulation test to monitor adrenal function.
Formulations
Flumethasone is available in a 0.5-mg/mL injection.
Stability and Storage

In Canada, cattle withdrawal time (meat): 4 days.
RCI Classification: 4
Flunixin Meglumine
floo-nix'in meg'loo-meen
Trade and Other Names: Banamine and generic brands
Functional Classification: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug {NSAID
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Flunixin is an NSAID. Flunixin and other NSAIDs produce analgesic and anti-
inflammatory effects by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins. The enzyme
inhibited by NSAID is the cyclo-oxygenase (COX) enzyme. The COX enzyme exists
in two isoforms: COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is primarily responsible for synthesis of
prostaglandins important for maintaining a healthy GI tract, renal function, platelet
function, and other normal functions. COX-2 is induced and responsible for
fever. However, it is known whether there is some crossover of COX-1 and COX-2
effects in some situations, and COX-2 activity is important for some biological
effects. Flunixin is not selective for either COX-l or COX-2. Other anti-
inflammatory effects may occur (such as effects on leukocytes) but have not been
well characterized. In horses, the half-life is 2 hours, oral absorption of paste is
77%, and absorption of granules is 85%. However, access to hay will delay peak
Au pag yim pax sisd pue sanuia a uondiosqe ieno pue suoeuu
be more erratic. In cattle the half-life is 3-4 hours IV, but it is longer when
administered IM. Oral absorption in cattle is 60%.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Flunixin is used primarily for short-term treatment of moderate pain and
inflammation. It has been used to treat abdominal pain in horses, to decrease signs
of sepsis in horses, and to decrease clinical signs associated with coliform mastitis in
cattle. In horses, as an adjunctive treatment for sepsis, it is used at a low dose of
0.25 mg/kg. It has been used as an adjunctive treatment, with antibiotics, for
treatment of bovine respiratory disease (BRD). Flunixin has been combined with
antibiotics for treatment of BRD (e.g., florfenicol in Resflor) in which it reduces
inflammatory lung reactions. Flunixin has been used as a single dose for treatment
of diarrhea in dairy calves. Flunixin at 2.2 mg/kg IV in cows with endotoxin
mastitis did not affect milk production, but it decreased fever and improved rumen
motility. ResflorGold contains both florfenicol and flunixin. It is used for the same
 Bovine Respiratory Disease pathogens and provides anti-inflammatory activity with
the addition of flunixin meglumine, including BRD-associated pyrexia in beef and
non-lactating dairy cattle.
 In pigs it is used for pyrexia associated with swine respiratory disease.
 In dogs and cats it has been used occasionally, but treatment is usually confined
to one or two treatments because of risk of gastrointestinal toxicity {ulcers and
perforation).
324Funixin Meglumine
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Most severe adverse effects are related to the GI system. Flunixin causes gastritis
and GI ulceration with high doses or prolonged use. In horses, flunixin
administration may affect recovery after ischemic injury to the intestine. Reduced
renal perfusion has also been documented. Therapy in dogs should be limited to
4 consecutive days. In horses, if given IM it can result in myositis and abscess at
the injection site.
Contraindications and Precautions
Avoid use in pregnant animals near term. Do not use in calves to be processed
for veal. Do not use in bulls intended for breeding because reproductive effects
in this class of cattle have not been studied. Flunixin is approved for IV treatment
in some food animals, but if the dose is administered IM or SQ, there is an
increased risk of meat residues.
Drug Interactions
 Ulcerogenic effects are potentiated when administered with corticosteroids.
Coadministration with phenylbutazone will increase the risk of hypoproteinemia
and gastric ulcers in horses. Flunixin, like other NSAIDs, may interfere with the
action of diuretics such as furosemide and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
inhibitors.
 Coadministration with enrofloxacin in dogs increased flunixin plasma
concentrations because of reduced clearance.
Instructions for Use
Flunixin is not approved for small animals but has been shown in experimental
studies to be an effective prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor. It is approved for use in
small animals in Europe.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor for signs of GI bleeding and ulcers during treatment.
Formulations
Flunixin is available in 250-mg packet granules in a 10-g packet and 10- and
50-mg/mL injection. It is also available as a paste, and each 30-g syringe contains
flunixin meglumine equivalent to l500 milligrams of flunixin. Flunixin is combined
with florfenicol in Resflor Gold, which has 300 mg florfenicol and l6.5 mg flunixin
per mL with vehicles of 2-pyrrolidone, 35 mg malic acid, and triacetin.

Fluoxetine Hydrochloride
floo-oks'eh-teen hye-droe-kloride
Trade and Other Names: Prozac (human fomulation); Reconcile (veterinary
formulation)
Functional Classification: Behavior modification, SSRI
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antidepressant drug. Fluoxetine, like other drugs in this class, is classified as a
 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Its mechanism of action appears to
be via selective inhibition of serotonin reuptake and downregulation of 5-HT,
receptors. SSRIs are more selective for inhibiting serotonin reuptake than the
ticyclic antidepressant (TCA) drugs. Fluoxetine is metabolized to norfluoxetine,
which is an active metabolite. Oral absorption in dogs is 72% with a half-life of 6-10
hours. The metabolite norfluoxetine has a longer half-life of 48-57 hours. In cats,
oral absorption is 100% with a half-life of 34-47 hours; the metabolite norfluoxetine
has a half-life of 5l-55 hours. Absorption in cats from transdermal administration is
only l0%. Another SSRI used in animals is paroxetine (Paxil).
Indications and Clinical Uses
Fluoxetine, like other SSRIs, is used to treat behavioral disorders such as
separation anxiety, canine compulsive behaviors, and dominance aggression. In cats,
it has been effective for decreasing urine spraying (1 mg/kg/day). In trials
comparing fluoxetine with clomipramine for treating urine marking in cats, both
drugs were equally effective for long-term use. In both dogs and cats SSRI have
been used for pain syndromes, but there are no studies of efficacy published for this
 indication. However, the urine marking returned after discontinuation of the drug.
Fluoxetine Hydrochloride327
In horses, fluoxetine has been used for “cribbing behavior” and other behavior
disorders.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Fluoxetine has fewer adverse effects (especially antihistamine and antimuscarinic
effects) compared to other antidepressant drugs. The most common reaction in
clinical trials was lethargy and decreased appetite. During clinical trials in dogs
adverse reactions included vomiting, lethargy, depression, trembling, and shaking
in some dogs. In rare cases it may cause seizures. In dogs, at high doses of
10-20 mg/kg it caused tremors, anorexia, aggressive behavior, nystagmus,
emesis, and ataxia. Occasionally some of these signs may be seen at lower doses.
In cats, nervousness or increased anxiousness has been observed. However, in
trials used for treating urine spraying, few adverse effects were reported. In cats 
5 mg/kg produced tremors and 3 mg/kg produced anorexia and vomiting.
However, cats have tolerated doses up to 50 mg/kg.
Contraindications and Precautions
 Use cautiously in animals prone to aggression because it may decrease inhibition.
 In early pregnancy it appears to be safe but has caused pulmonary hypertension
in experimental animals late in pregnancy.
Drug Interactions
Do not use with other behavior-modifying drugs such as other SSRIs or TCAs.
Do not use with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Administration with
selegiline may induce a reaction. Because it is highly metabolized by the liver, it
may be subject to interactions caused by cytochrome P450 inhibitors.
Instructions for Use
Always use in conjunction with comprehensive behavior modification protocol.
Clinical efficacy of fluoxetine for separation anxiety in dogs has been established
from clinical studies. Because of long half-life, accumulation in plasma may take
several days to weeks. There may be a delay in the onset of action of 2 weeks.
and has been used for smaller-size animals. Do not use transdermally; absorption
is low.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Use in animals has been relatively safe, and one should only monitor behavior
changes.
Formulations
Fluoxetine is available in veterinary formulations of 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-mg tablets
and in human formulations of 10-, 20-, and 40-mg capsules, 10-mg tablets, and
4-mg/mL oral solution.
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature.
It is soluble in water at 14 mg/mL and in alcohol at 100 mg/mL. Fluoxetine
hydrochloride solution has been mixed with various juices, and flavorings and found
to be stable for 8 weeks. In one trial it was mixed in tuna-flavored water for cats and
retained effectiveness.

Fluticasone Propionate
(floo-tik'ah-sone proe-pee-oe-nayt)
Trade and Other Names: Flovent
Functional Classification: Corticosteroid
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Potent glucocorticoid anti-inflammatory drug with potency of l8 times that of
desamethasone. In patients with inflammatory airway diseases, glucocorticoids have
potent anti-inflammatory effects on the bronchial mucosa. Glucocorticoids bind
to receptors on cells and inhibit the transcription of genes for the production
of mediators (cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules) involved in airway
inflammation. A decrease in the synthesis of inflammatory mediators such as
prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and platelet-activating factor caused by glucocorticoids
also may be important. Glucocorticoids also play a role in enhancing the action of
adrenergic agonists on beta-2 receptors in the bronchial smooth muscle, either by
 bound. Corticosteroids also may prevent downregulation of beta-2 receptors.
Topical (inhaled) corticosteroids such as fluticasone or budesonide are used to avoid
systemic effects. They typically have high frst-pass effects and low systemic exposure
 f swallowed. Because of low systemic effects, fluticasone produces less systemic
steroid effects than prednisolone, such as effects on water consumption, appetite,
and systemic immunity.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Fluticasone is used as an inhaled (topical) corticosteroid for treatment of airway
disease. Most of the use has been established for cats, but it also could be used for
dogs, horses, or other animals in which a special adapter can be used to deliver the
drug via a metered-dose inhaler. In dogs and cats the most common use is for
inflammatory airway diseases such as asthma, bronchitis, or bronchospasm. For
example, if a cat is given 2 puffs twice a day of a potent inhaled corticosteroid (e.g.,
budesonide, fluticasone) and allowed 5-7 breaths (l0 sec) from a chamber (spacer),
it may reduce the need for oral prednisolone in cats with feline asthma. When doses
were compared in experimental cats, the low dose of 44 mcg twice daily was as
effective as 110 or 220 mcg twice daily.
Futicasone Propionate 329
In horses the most common use is for recurrent airway obstruction (RAO),
formerly called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Although fluticasone systemic absorption is low, some systemic exposure will occur
 in animals. Side effects can occur but are not expected to be as severe as with
systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal suppression is expected to occur in treated animals
(suppressed ACTH response) but may recover once treatment is discontinued.
Contraindications and Precautions
Use cautiously in patients with oral or respiratory tract infections because
immunosuppression may occur.
Drug Interactions
Some systemic effects are possible but minimal. Administration of corticosteroids
with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) will increase the risk of GI
injury.
Instructions for Use
The use is based on administration of fluticasone for treatment of airway diseases.
It is delivered via a metered-dose inhaler. These inhalers can be used in animals if
special adaptations, such as a spacer device, which are available for use in pediatrics
or for cats and horses, are used. When treating dogs and cats, doses listed in the

Furosemide
fyoo-roe'seh-mide
Trade and Other Names: Lasix and generic brands
Functional Classification: Diuretic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Furosemide is a loop diuretic that inhibits the Nat/K+ /2Cl cotransporter in the
ascending thick loop of Henle. It is often called high-ceiling diuretics because it is
more effective than other diuretics. Furosemide decreases the sodium, chloride, and
potassium reabsorption from the tubule. Subsequently, these ions are retained in the
renal tubule and presented to the distal nephron. Dilute unine is produced because
water is retained in the tubule when it reaches the distal tubule. In addition, there is
 prostaglandin synthesis. Furosemide increases intrarenal prostaglandin production
(e.g., PGI2), which increases renal blood flow. Synthesis of prostaglandins also may
cause vasodilation in other tissues. The plasma half-life in animals is short (l.5-3 hours);
therefore, this is a short-acting drug. Oral absorption can be highly variable, but in
horses oral absorption is so low that this is not a viable method of administration.
334 Furosemide
Indications and Clinical Uses
In small animals, firosemide is the drug of choice to treat conditions that cause
edema: pulmonary edema, liver disease, heart disease, and vascular disease. It
ncreases unine production and can be used to treat acute renal failure. In addition,
furosemide will increase Kt and Catt excretion and is used to treat hyperkalemia and
hypercalcemia. In horses, furosemide has been used to treat edema and syndromes
associated with congestion. The most common use in horses is pretreatment prior to
racing. Although it appears to produce faster racing times, the mechanism is unclear.
It may decrease body weight via water loss and may decrease exercise-induced
pulmonary hemorrhage (EIPH). However, the efficacy to reduce EIPH has been
controversial in horses. In cattle, furosemide also is used for treating conditions of
edema (e.g., udder edema) and for treatment of heart failure and pulmonary
hypertension.
 In all animals, duration of effect is short, approximately 2-4 hours.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects are primarily related to diuretic effect (loss of fluid and

(ACE) inhibitors to decrease the risk of azotemia. Repeated administration may
increase aldosterone levels via activation of RAAS.
Drug Interactions
Concurrent use with aminoglycoside antibiotics or amphotericin B may increase
nisk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. Administration of nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with furosemide may diminish the effect. The pH
of solution is 8-9.8. Furosemide is stable with alkaline drugs, but do not mix
with acidifying drug solutions with pH <5.5.
Instructions for Use
Recommendations are based on extensive clinical use of furosemide in animals. The
onset of effect after an injection is usually 5 minutes, with the peak at 30 minutes
and a duration of approximately 2 hours. Constant rate infusions (CRI) in dogs and
horses can be more effective than intermittent bolus. Long-term repeated
administration may attenuate the effects because of tolerance and activation of the
RAAS.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor electrolyte concentrations (particularly potassium) and hydration status in
patients during treatment.
Formulations
Furosemide is available in 12.5-, 20-, 40-, 50-, and 80-mg tablets; 20-, 40-, and
80-mg tablets (human preparation); 10-mg/mL oral solution (syrup), and 50-mg/
mL injection. Tablets usually can be casily split.
Furosemide 335
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature.
 Do not mix with acidic solutions. It is compatible in plastic syringes and
infusion sets. Furosemide is poorly soluble in water but may be mixed with 5%
dextrose, 0.9% saline, or lactated Ringer's solution at a concentration of
10 mg/mL. These solutions are stable for 8 hours. It is more soluble if the pH is
>8, but it readily precipitates when pH is <5.5. Compounded oral formulations in
syrups and other flavorings are stable if kept at alkaline pH or in alcohol. However,
lower pH will result in instability of formulation. If discoloration occurs, discard
formulation.

336 Gabapentin
Gabapentin
gab'ah-pen-tin
Trade and other names: Gabapetin, Neurontin, and genenic brands
Functional classification: Anticonvulsant, analgesic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Anticonvulsant and analgesic. Gabapentin is an analogue of the inhibitory
neurotransmitter GABA; however, it is not an agonist or antagonist for the GABA
receptor. The mechanism of anticonvulsant action and analgesic effects is not clear,
but there is evidence that the mechanism of action appears to be via blocking
calcium-dependent channels. Gabapentin inhibits the alpha-2-delta (o O) subunit of
the N-type voltage-dependent calcium channel on neurons. Via inhibition, it reduces
calcium influx that is needed for release of neurotransmitters—specifically, excitatory
amino acids—from presynaptic neurons. Blocking the channels has little effect on
normal neurons, but it may suppress simulated neurons involved in seizure activity
and pain. Half-life in dogs and cats is only 3-4 hours, which may necessitate
frequent administration. In horses the half-life is 8 hours (range 6.7-12 hrs), but the
oral absorption is only l6%. Another related drug is pregabalin (Lyrica), which is
s uuadeqeo 'sop ul pasn uaq osie seu pue ud redanau roy aidoad u pa
eliminated entirely by renal clearance in people, but there is 30-40% hepatic
metabolism in dogs. Therefore, some interactions are possible with drugs that affect
hepatic clearance, or with hepatic disease may compromise hepatic function.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Gabapentin is used as an anticonvulsant and to treat chronic pain syndromes,
lou saop ieu ued siuedainiu jea ci pasn si i 'ued siuedonau Sunu
respond to nonsteroidal anti-infammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or opiates. However,
studies demonstrating efficacy for pain treatment in dogs and cats are currently
lacking. When used to treat epilepsy, it (or pregabalin) is usually considered when
the seizures have become refractory to other drugs. Clinical effcacy studies in
veterinary medicine are lacking for either use, and treatment regimens have been
mostly derived from anecdotal evidence or extrapolation from human medicine.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Sedation and ataxia are reported adverse effects. As dose increases in dogs (see
dosing section), sedation is more likely. In people a withdrawal syndrome from
abrupt discontinuation has been described, but it is not reported in animals. The
dogs and produces hypoglycemia and liver injury with high doses exceeding
0.l g/kg. With standard doses of gabapentin oral solution, the toxic level of
xylitol is not likely to be exceeded, but one should be cautious about adding
other drugs that also contain xylitol.
Contraindications and Precautions
No known contraindications.
Drug Interactions
Antacids decrease oral absorption.
Gemfibrozil337
Instructions for Use
Gabapentin has been used in some animals as an anticonvulsant when they are
refractory to other drugs. It can be used with other drugs such as phenobarbital and
bromide. It also has been used to treat neuropathic pain syndromes and can be used
with NSAIDs and opioids. Effcacy for cach of these indications is anecdotal; there
are no controlled studies published.

Gentamicin Sulfate
jen-tah-mye'sin sul'fate
Trade and other names: Gentocin, Garasol, Garacin, and generic
Functional classification: Antibacteria
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Aminoglycoside antibiotic. Action is to inhibit bacteria protein synthesis via binding
to 30S ribosome. Bactericidal. Gentamicin has a broad spectrum of activity that
includes most bacterial isolates in animals, including staphylococci and gram-
negative bacilli of the Enterobacterinceae. It is not very active against streptococci
and anaerobic bactenia. The pharmacokinetics have been studied in many domestic
Gentamicin Sulfate 339
and exotic animal species. The half-life is typically l-2 hours in mammals, and the
volume of distribution is approximately 0.2-0.3 L/kg. Clearance is via glomerular
filtration.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Gentamicin has a rapid, bactericidal action and is indicated for acute serious
infections, such as those caused by gram-negative bacilli. Gentamicin has been
administered IM, SQ, and IV. It is not absorbed after oral administration, and this
use is restricted to labeled use in pigs. Gentamicin, like other aminoglycosides, can
be used with beta-lactam antibiotics because it broadens the spectrum when used

generally active against most gram-negative bacilli, amikacin is more consistently
active against resistant strains. The only approved use in food animals is oral
treatment in pigs for swine dysentery.
G
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Nephrotoxicity is the most dose-limiting toxicity. Ensure that patients have
adequate fluid and electrolyte balance during therapy. Electrolyte depletion will
increase the risk of nephrotoxicity. High levels of calcium and protein in the diet
will decrease the risk of nephrotoxicitiy. Ototoxicity and vestibulotoxicity also are
possible but have not been reported in animals. With high doses, neuromuscular
toxicity is possible, although rare.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not administer to animals with compromised renal finction, renal
insuffciency, or renal failure. There should be adequate renal clearance for
clearance of gentamicin. Use in young animals is accepted, except higher doses
may be necessary.
Drug Interactions
When used with anesthetic agents, neuromuscular blockade is possible. Do not
mix in vial or syringe with other antibiotics. Ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity are
potentiated by loop diuretics such as furosemide.
Instructions for Use
 Dosing regimens are based on sensitivity of organisms. Some studies have suggested
that once-daily therapy (combining multiple doses into a single daily dose) is as
efficacious as multiple treatments. Activity against some bacteria (e.g., Psendomonas
aerwginosa) is enhanced when combined with a beta-lactam antibiotic, such
as ceftazidime. Nephrotoxicity is increased with persistently high trough
concentrations.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
 (    aa   
point for susceptibility is ≤2 mcg/mL. Monitor BUN, creatinine, and urine for
evidence of renal toxicity. Blood levels can be monitored to measure for problems

5 mg/kg IM; 14 days meat at 5 mg/kg PO.
 If gentamicin is administered systemically to cattle, an extended withdrawal time
is necessary because of persistence of residues in kidney. FARAD recommends 18
months. After systemic administration of 5 mg/kg, milk withdrawal time should be
 5 days. If gentamicin is administered intramammary (500 mg per quarter), a milk
withdrawal time of at least l0 days and a meat withdrawal time of l80 days should
be used.

Glipizide
glip-ih'zide
Trade and other names: Glucotrol
Functional classification: Antidiabetic agent, hypoglycemic agent
Glipizide34l
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Sulfonylurea oral hypoglycemic agent. This drug acts to increase secretion of insulin
from beta cells of the pancreas, probably by interacting with sulfonylurea receptors
         
channels on the pancreatic beta cells, which increases insulin secretion. These drugs
also may increase sensitivity of existing insulin receptors. Studies in cats showed that
glipizide had a half-life of 17 hours and effective plasma concentration for 50%
efficacy (ECso) of 70 mcg/mL.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Glipizide is used as oral treatment in the management of diabetes mellitus, particularly
in cats. Response rate in cats is approximately 44%-65% (some reports are 30% or
lower). The response rate in dogs is poor. It has been more common to administer the
sulfonylurea class of drugs in animals than other oral hypoglycemic drugs because

they have had better efficacy. Glipizide is the most common of this class. Other oral
hypoglycemic drugs include acetohexamide, chlorpropamide, glyburide ( DiaBeta,
Micronase), gliclazide, and tolazamide. Metformin is of the biguanide class of oral
drugs for diabetes and has not had efficacy as high as glipizide in cats.
organogel [PLO]) vehicle is poor in cats (<20%) and inconsistent. This route is not
recommended.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
It may cause dose-related vomiting, anorexia, increased bilirubin, and elevated
iver enzymes in some cats (l5%). It may exacerbate deposits of amyloid in feline
pancrease and increase the loss of pancreatic beta cells. Glipizide may cause
hypoglycemia, but less so than insulin. In people, increased cardiac mortality is
possible, but this has not been reported in cats.
Contraindications and Precautions
Many cats do not respond and will require insulin therapy. Do not rely on
glipizide in cats that are not stable or if they are dehydrated or debilitated.
Drug Interactions
Many drug interactions have been reported in people. It is not known if these
occur in animals. Use cautiously with beta blockers, antifungal drugs,
anticoagulants, fluoroquinolones, sulfonamides, and others.
Instructions for Use
diabetes. There has been only limited use in animals. Because response to oral
hypoglycemic agents in cats is unpredictable, it is recommended to use a trial first of
at least 4 weeks. If the cat responds, the drug can be continued; otherwise, insulin
may be indicated. Feed cats a high-fiber diet when using oral hypoglycemic agents.
Transdermal glipizide (5-mg dose) in a PLO gel was evaluated in cats. Although the

and chondroitin sulfate. Other forms include glucosamine sodium sulfate and
glucosamine potassium sulfate. Glucosamine has been promoted to stimulate
synthesis of synovial fluid, inhibit degradation, and improve healing of articular
cartilage. Additional information is available in the section on chondroitin sulfate.
Bioavailability studies have produced varying results depending on fomulation, assay
technique, and species. Oral absorption of glucosamine has varied, ranging from
12% in dogs to only 2.5% (125 mg/kg) or 6% (20 mg/kg) in horses. Although in
vitro studies have demonstrated benefts to articular cartilage, some studies have
questioned whether oral glucosamine is absorbed systemically intact to a high
form administered because glucosamine sulfate may be better absorbed than
glucosamine hydrochloride.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Glucosamine is used primarily for treatment of degenerative joint disease and is
usually found in formulations in combination with chondroitin sulfate. (See
Chondroitin sulfate for additional details.) Analyses of published clinical studies in
Glucosamine + Chondroitin Sulfate 343
dogs have concluded that there is a moderate level of evidence to indicate some
benefit in osteoarthritis, but results may be inconsistent among studies. Benefits of
treatment in horses with lameness also have been reported from oral administration
systemic administration is effective for reducing recurrent urinary tract infections in
animals (via a beneficial effect on bladder mucosa). These compounds are regulated
as dietary supplements that modify disease and are not regulated as drugs.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
In some animals, soft stools and intestinal gas have been reported. In
experimental rodents, injections of glucosamine can cause hyperglycemia, insulin
resistance, and a decrease in the metabolic action of insulin via the hexosamine
G
pathway. However, the clinical relevance of these findings has not been shown.
Clinical studies in dogs have shown that short-term (2l days) administration of
glucosamine does not affect glycemic control or cause diabetes mellitus in dogs
Otherwise, adverse effects have not been reported, although hypersensitivity is
possible.
Contraindications and Precautions
The safety of glucosamine has not been established in diabetic animals or obese
animals that may be prone to developing diabetes. Otherwise, there are no
known precautions.
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions are reported. Glucosamine- and chondroitin-containing
 products may be used safely with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs).
Instructions for Use
 Doses are based primarily on empiricism and manufacturer's recommendations.
There are few published trials of efficacy or dose titrations available to determine
optimal dose. Doses listed are general recommendations and may vary among
products. Glucosamine hydrochloride is more bioavailable than glucosamine sulfate.
Products may vary in their stability, purity, and potency. Use products from a
reputable supplier.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
 No routine patient monitoring is necessary. There is no evidence that glucosamine
administration will increase senum glucose. Glucosamine is produced by glucose in
the body, but this is an irreversible reaction.
Formulations
Several formulations are available. Veterinarians are encouraged to carefully
examine product label to ensure proper strength. One product (Cosequin) is
available as regular-strength (“RS") and double-strength (“DS") capsules.
Regular strength contains 250 mg glucosamine; 200 mg chondroitin sulfate; and
mixed glycosaminoglycans, 5 mg manganese, and 33 mg manganese ascorbate.
The DS tablets contain double of each of these amounts. Products for horses

Glyburide
glye'byoor-ide
Trade and other names: Diabeta, Micronase, Glynase, and Glibenclamide
(British name)
Functional classification: Antidiabetic agent, hypoglycemic agent
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Glyburide is a sulfonylurea oral hypoglycemic agent; it is also known as
glibenclamide. This drug acts to increase secretion of insulin from pancreas,
with adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium channels on pancreatic beta
cells, which increases secretion of insulin. These drugs also may increase sensitivity of
existing insulin receptors. It is used as oral treatment in the management of diabetes
mellitus, particularly in cats. The response rate is approximately 40%. Sulfonylurea
drugs include glipizide (Glucotrol) and glybunde (DiaBeta, Micronase). Metformin
is of the biguanide class of oral drugs for diabetes.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Oral hypoglycemic agents are successful in people only for noninsulin-dependent
diabetes. There has been only limited use in animals. Glyburide is not effective in
dogs but has been used in some cats. Some cats may initially respond to oral
hypoglycemic agents but eventually need insulin treatment. Similar drugs include
acetohexamide, chlorpropamide, glipizide, gliclazide, and tolazamide. There is more
Glyburide  345
experience with glipizide than with other drugs, and it should be used as the first
choice (see Glipizide section for more details.).
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
It may cause dose-related vomiting, anorexia, increased bilirubin, and elevated
iver enzymes in some cats. Glyburide causes hypoglycemia but less so than
insulin. In people, increased cardiac mortality is possible.
Contraindications and Precautions
There are no known contraindications in animals.
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions are reported for animals. Many drug interactions have been
reported in people. It is not known if these occur in animals because clinical use
has been rare. Use cautiously with beta blockers, antifungal drugs, anticoagulants,
fluoroquinolones, and sulfonamides.
Instructions for Use
Because response to oral hypoglycemic agents in cats is unpredictable, it is
recommended to use a trial first of at least 4 weeks. If the cat responds, the drug
can be continued. Otherwise, insulin may be indicated. Feed cats a high-fiber diet
when using oral hypoglycemic agents.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor blood glucose levels to determine if the drug is effective. Monitor liver
enzymes.
Formulations
Glyburide is available in 1.25-, 2.5-, and 5-mg tablets (Diabeta and Micronase).

Glycopyrrolate 347
Glycopyrrolate
glye-koe-peer'oe-late
Trade and other names: Robinul-V
Functional classification: Anticholinergic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Anticholinergic agent (blocks acetylcholine effect at muscarinic receptor),
parasympatholytic. Glycopyrrolate produces atropine-like effects systemically.
However, glycopyrrolate may have less effect on CNS compared to atropine because
of lower penetration to CNS. It may produce a longer duration of action than
atropine.
G
Indications and Clinical Uses
Glycopyrrolate is used to inhibit vagal effects and increase heart rate in animals. It
also will decrease respiratory, salivary, and GI secretions. It may be used as an
adjunct to anesthesia when it is necessary to override vagal stimulus.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects attributed to antimuscarinic (anticholinergic) effects. Side effects
of therapy include xerostomia, ileus, constipation, tachycardia, and urine
retention.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not use in patients with glaucoma, intestinal ileus, gastroparesis, or
tachycardia.
Drug Interactions
No specific drug interactions are reported for animals. However, it is expected
that glycopyrrolate, like other anticholinergic drugs, will antagonize drugs that
stimulate respiratory and GI secretions and GI motility.
Instructions for Use
Glycopyrrolate is often used in combination with other agents, particularly anesthetic
dnugs. Although some anesthetic agents such as alpha-2 agonists and opioids are
associated with bradycardia, it is rarely necessary to administer anticholinergic agents
to reduce the bradycardia.

Granisetron Hydrochloride
grah-nih'seh-tron hye-droe-klorride
Trade and other names: Kytril
Functional classification: Antiemetic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antiemetic drug from the class of drugs called serotonin antagonists. These drugs
act by inhibiting serotonin (5-HT, type 3) receptors. During chemotherapy, there
may be 5-HT released from injury to the GI tract that stimulates vomiting centrally,
which is blocked by this class of dnugs. These drugs also have been used to treat
vomiting from other forms of gastroenteritis. Serotonin antagonists used for
antiemetic therapy include granisetron, ondansetron, dolasetron, azestron, and
tropisetron.
Indications and ClinicalUses
Granisetron, like other serotonin antagonists, is used primarily as an antiemetic
during chemotherapy, for which they generally have been superior to other
drugs in effcacy. It may be administered prior to chemotherapy to prevent nausea
and vomiting. Use in animals has been primarily derived from empirical use. There
are no well-controlled clinical studies or efficacy trials to document clinical
effectiveness.

Griseofulvin
grizs-ee-oh-ful'vin
Trade and other names: Microsize: Fulvicin U/F, Grisactin, and Gnifulvin and
Ultramicrosize: Fulvicin P/G, and GrisPEG
Functional classification: Antifungal
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antifungal drug. After systemic administration, griseofulvin is deposited in the
keratin precursor cells of the skin and hair. It is rapidly taken up into these tissues
within 4-8 hours or 48-72 hours (depending on the study) after administration.
Griseofulvin 353
Once it is incorporated into these cells, mitosis of the fungal cells is inhibited by
  s  a      
Indications and ClinicalUses
Griseofulvin is one of the drugs of choice when systemic treatment is needed for
dermatophyte infections caused by Microsporum spp., and Trichophyton spp. in dogs
not effective for the treatment of yeasts or bacteria. At least 4 weeks, and sometimes
3 months or more, are needed for successful therapy. Its use has been replaced by
azole antifungal drugs in many cases {itraconazole, fluconazole, etc.). It also has a
predilection to accumulate in inflammatory sites of the skin and may be effective
for treating some noninfectious, inflammatory dermatoses other than
dermatomycosis.
G
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects in animals include teratogenicity in cats, anemia and leukopenia
in cats, anorexia, depression, vomiting, and diarrhea. In cats, feline
immunodefciency virus (FIV) infection may increase the risk of bone marow
toxicosis. Whether the bone marrow problems are caused by high doses or is an
idiosyncratic (non-dose related) reaction is not understood. These effects resolve
in cats when treatment is stopped, but irreversible idiosyncratic pancytopenia has
been reported.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not administer to pregnant cats. Caution should be used when administering
griseofulvin to cats with viral infections (FIV) because this may exacerbate bone
marrow effects.
Drug Interactions
Griseofulvin is an enhancer of cytochrome P450 drug enzymes. Therefore, other
concurrent drugs may be metabolized and cleared more quickly if given with
griseofulvin.
Instructions for Use
A wide range of doses has been reported. Doses listed here represent the current
consensus. Oral absorption is favored in the presence of fat, and administration of
the drug with a high-fat meal can tremendously enhance the extent of absorption.
Two formulations are available: microsize and ultramicrosize. Administration of a
formulation made up of fine particles also will increase absorption. Veterinary
formulations are generally composed of microsize preparations, and this is reflected
in the dosage regimens. If the ultramicrosized preparations are used, the dose may
be decreased by half. Shake oral suspension well before using. Consider 25 mg/kg
ql2h initially, and then increase to 50-60 mg/kg ql2h for problem cases.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor CBC for evidence of bone marrow toxicity.

Trade and other names: Glyceryl guaiacolate, Guaiphenesin, Geocolate,
Guailaxin, Glycotuss, Hytuss, Glytuss, Fenesin, Humabid LA, and Mucinex
Functional classification: Expectorant; muscle relaxant
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Guaifenesin, which is also known as glyderyl guaiacolate, is a compound
that has been an older, traditional therapy for treating cough in people, although
the efficacy has been questioned for this effect. For respiratory disease, it is
via stimulation of vagal transmission to produce more viscous bronchial
secretions.
As an anesthetic adjunct, it is used as a preanesthetic with barbiturates and other
drugs. It is a central-acting skeletal muscle relaxant and causes sedation and
relaxation via depression of nerve transmission. Pharmacokinetic information is
imited, but half-life in ponies is 60-84 minutes. Duration of action in horses is
approximately 30 minutes.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Guaifenesin is administered IV (particularly in large animals) as an adjunct to
anesthesia and orally in animals as an expectorant. Historically, it also has been used
as an analgesic and antipyretic. Most often it is used prior to induction of general
anesthesia in horses, but it also has been used in other species. Supporting data for
an expectorant effect are lacking. It may increase the volume and reduce the
viscosity of secretions in the trachea and bronchi. It may also facilitate removal of
secretions.
356  Guaifenesin
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Minor leakage outside the vein from an intravenous injection does not cause
tissue injury. However, thrombophlebitis from intravenous injection may occur.
Hypotension may occur from high doses. Some hemolysis has been observed
from intravenous infusion, but this is not significant at a concentration less than
 15%. A vagal effect (e.g., stimulation of secretions) may occur when the drug is
used as an expectorant.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not administer IV if visible precipitate is observed.
Oral formulations for people (cough and cold remedies) may contain other
ingredients such as dextromethorphan or decongestants (e.g., phenylepherine or
pseudoephedrine). Do not use these combinations in animals sensitive to these
drugs, and if possible use only formulations that contain guaifenesin.
Drug Interactions
 No significant drug interactions are reported. It has been safely used with
 acepromazine, xylazine, detomidine, ketamine, thiopental, and pentobarbital.
Instructions for Use
For anesthetic purposes, 5% guaifenesin is prepared from powder (50 g/L)
dissolved in sterile water. It dissolves more readily if the water is warm. Infusion of
 110 mg/kg can produce transient recumbency, but usually it is administered with
other agents.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitoring of animals during anesthesia (heart rate, rhythm, and respiratory rate) is
 suggested. Hypotension is possible; therefore blood pressure should be monitored.
Formulations
Guaifenesin is available in intravenous solutions that are prepared prior to infusion
from powder to a 5% solution. It is also available in a 100- and 200-mg tablet;
600-mg extended-release tablets; and 20-mg/mL and 40-mg/mL oral solution
 Human over-the-counter formulations may contain other ingredients such as
dextromethorphan and decongestants.
Stability and Storage
Guaifenesin is soluble in water and in alcohol. It is more soluble in warm water. It
will precipitate if the temperature is 22*C or colder. It should be administered orally
shortly after preparation because stability is short. However, 10% solutions have
been stable for as long as 7 days. For intravenous use it has been mixed with
xylazine and ketamine, without apparent loss of stability.

358  Halothane
Halothane
hal'oe-thane
Trade and other names: Fluothane
Functional classification: Inhalant anesthetic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Inhalant anesthetic. Halothane is a multi-halogenated ethane. It is characterized by
rapid induction and recovery, high potency, and few adverse effects. Like other
inhalant anesthetics, the mechanism of action is uncertain. They produce
 generalized, reversible depression of the CNS. The inhalant anesthetics vary in their
solubility in blood, their potency, and the rate of induction and recovery. Those
with low blood/gas partition coeffcients are associated with the most rapid rates of
induction and recovery. Halothane has a vapor pressure of 243 mm Hg (at 20° C),
a blood/gas partition coeffcient of 2.3, and a fat/blood coeffcient of 5l. Because
of high solubility in fat, its clearance from the body is slower than other agents.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Halothane, like other inhalant anesthetics, is used for general anesthesia in animals.
It has a minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) value of 1.04%, 0.87%, and 0.88%
inhalant anesthetics (e.g., isoflurane) in many veterinary practices.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Like other inhalant anesthetics, halothane produces vasodilation and increased
blood flow to cerebral blood vessels. This may increase intracranial pressure.
Also like other inhalant anesthetics, it produces a dose-dependent myocardial
depression, with accompanying decrease in cardiac output. It also depresses
respiratory rate and alveolar ventilation. Like other inhalant anesthetics, it
increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmias, especially in response to
catecholamines. Hepatotoxicity has been reported in people

Hemoglobin Glutamer (Oxyglobin)
hee'moe-gloe-bin gloot'am-er
Trade and other names: Oxyglobin
H
Functional classification: Iron supplement, hemoglobin substitute
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Hemoglobin glutamer (bovine) is used as oxygen-carrying fluid in dogs with varying
causes of anemia. Oxyglobin is an ultrapurified polymerized bovine hemoglobin. The
molecular weight is 64,000-500,000 (average 200,000). Osmolality is 300 mOsm/
mL. Colloid osmotic pressure is higher than other colloids, with a colloid osmotic
is metabolized by macrophages, and 95% of a dose is eliminated in 5-9 days.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Hemoglobin glutamer has been used to treat anemia caused by blood loss,
hemolysis, or decreased blood cell production. Although approved for dogs, it also
has been used in cats.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Circulatory overload is possible, especially with high doses and rapid
administration. Patients at the most risk of circulatory overload are those with
cardiac disease, respiratory disease, risk of hypertension, cerebral edema, oliguria/
anuria caused by renal failure, and cats. Pulmonary hypertension has been
observed because of depletion of nitric oxide (NO) and volume overload.
Because cats are more sensitive to the adverse effects than dogs, lower dose
rates should be used in cats. Other adverse effects have been skin and mucous
membrane discoloration, vomiting, diarrhea, and anorexia. Discoloration of skin
and mucous membranes can persist for 3-5 days.
Contraindications and Precautions
Hemoglobin glutamer should not be used in dogs with advanced heart disease.
Administer with caution to cats because of an increased risk of pulmonary
hypertension.
Drug Interactions
Do not administer with other drugs via the same infusion set. Do not mix with
other drugs.
360   Heparin Sodium
Instructions for Use
Administer using aseptic technique. In 5-7 days, 90% of dose is eliminated.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Patients receiving hemoglobin glutamer should be monitored carefilly. Use of
Oxyglobin does not require cross-matching. Monitoring packed cell volume ( PCV)
 or hematocrit is not useful for assessing response to Oxyglobin therapy. Oxyglobin
will interfere with other monitoring tests, such as blood chemistry analysis
(colorimetric assays). Doses of 30 mL/kg are listed by manufacturer, but many
veterinarians use 10-15 mL/kg.
Formulations
Hemoglobin glutamer is available in 13 g/dL polymerized hemoglobin of bovine
origin in l25-mL single-dose bags. Availability from manufacturer may be limited.
Stability and Storage
At room temperature, hemoglobin glutamer has a 3-year shelf-life. Once opened, a
125-mL bag should be used within 24 hours because of oxidation of hemoglobin to
methemoglobin. Do not freeze.
Small Animal Dosage
Dogs
· One-time dose of 10-30 mL/kg IV or up to a rate of 5-10 mL/kg/hr.
Cats
· One-time dose of 3-5 mL/kg IV, slowly. Maximum rate is 5 mg/kg/hr and not
to exceed 13-20 mL/kg in 24 hours.
Large Animal Dosage
No doses reported. Do not use in race horses.
Regulatory Information
No regulatory information is available. Because of low risk of residues, no
withdrawal times are suggested. However, hemoglobin glutamer (Oxyglobin) is
prohibited to be on the premises of racing horses.

Heparin Sodium
hep'ah-rin soe'dee-um
Trade and other names: Liquaemin and Hepalean (Canada)
Functional classification: Anticoagulant
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Anticoagulant. Heparin produces its action by increasing antithrombin
III-mediated inhibition of synthesis and activity of factor Xa. Heparin differs from
low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) by an equal anti-factor Xa/anti-factor IIa
In people, there is an advantage of LMWH over conventional heparin because
the LMWHs have longer half-lives and less frequent administration is needed.
However, this may not be an advantage for dogs and cats. See the description
Heparin Sodium 361
of LMWH for more information (enoxaparin [ Lovenox], and dalteparin
[Fragmin ]).
Indications and Clinical Uses
prevent coagulation disorders such as thromboembolism, venous thrombosis,
disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), and pulmonary thromboembolism.
Use in specific situations in animals is primarily anecdotal or derived from the
thrombosis in canine patients with immune-mediated hemolytic anemia has not been
effective (300 units/kg q6h). In horses, it is used to prevent thrombosis in patients
at risk.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
H
Adverse effects caused by excessive inhibition of coagulation result in bleeding.
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, a problem in people, has not been cited as a
problem in animals. If excessive anticoagulation and bleeding occur as a result of
an overdose, protamine sulfate should be administered to reverse heparin therapy.
Protamine should be administered by slow IV infusion. Protamine complexes
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not use in animals unless able to monitor bleeding because it may be life
threatening. Do not inject IM because it may create a hematoma.
Drug Interactions
has not been identified, use cautiously in animals that may be receiving certain
chondroprotective compounds, such as glycosaminoglycans for treatment of
arthnitis.
Instructions for Use
 Dose adjustments should be perfommed by monitoring clotting times. For example,
dose is adjusted to maintain activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) at 1.5 to
2 times normal. For information on other forms of heparin, such as LMWHs, see
dalteparin or enoxaparin. Duration of anticoagulant effect may vary among patients,
but in general, a 200-unit/kg dose in dogs has a duration of effect of approximately
6 hours.
In high-risk patients, doses used include 500 units/kg SQ or IM, followed by
reduced doses such as those listed in dosing section q8-l2h.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor effect using APTT or anti-Xa activity. Dose is adjusted to maintain APTT

Hetastarch
het'ah-starch 
Trade and other names: HES, Hydroxyethyl starch, Hetastarch, and
Hespan
Functional classification: Fluid replacement
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Hetastarch is a synthetic colloid volume expander that is used to maintain vascular
volume in animals with circulatory shock. It is a modified branched-chain glucose
polymer prepared from hydroxyethyl starch and is derived from amylopectin. There
are two hydroxyethyl starch preparations: hetastarch and pentastarch. Hetastarch
(6%) has an average molecular weight of 450,000 and colloid osmotic pressure of
32.7. Pentastarch (10%) has an average molecular weight of 280,000 and colloid
osmotic pressure of 40. Because hetastarch is a larger molecular weight compound
than pentastarch, it tends to remain in the vasculature and prevent loss of
intravascular volume and prevent tissue edema. Other colloids used are dextrans
(Dextran 40 and Dextran 70)
Indications and Clinical Uses
Hetastarch is used primarily to treat acute hypovolemia and shock. It is
administered IV in acute situations. Hetastarch has a duration of effective volume
expansion of 12-48 hours. One of the disadvantages to use of hetastarch is the
high cost.
Hetastarch 363
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Only limited use in veterinary medicine; therefore, adverse effects have not been
reported. However, it may cause allergic reactions and hyperosmotic renal
dysfunction. Hetastarch suspensions may affect platelet function at clinically
relevant doses for up to 24 hours. Do not use in patients with bleeding problems
or preexisting coagulopathies.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not use in animals with bleeding problems (coagulopathies) or active
hemorrhage.
Drug Interactions
Hetastarch is available compatible with most fluid solutions.
Instructions for Use
H
Suspend in saline (0.9%) or 5% dextrose solution for use. Administer in 5-mL/kg
increments to small animals, then reassess and increase the dose to rates listed in the
dosing section. Hetastarch is used in critical care situations, and it is infused via
constant rate infusion (CRI). Hetastarch appears to be more effective and produce
fewer side effects than Dextran. Infuse slowly.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests

364Hydralazine Hydrochloride
Hydralazine Hydrochloride
hye-drahl'ah-zeen hye-droe-kloride
Trade and other names: Apresoline
Functional classification: Vasodilator
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Vasodilator. Antihypertensive. Hydralazine relaxes vascular smooth muscle and
reduces blood pressure. In arteriolar vascular beds it relaxes vascular smooth muscle
to reduce vascular resistance and improves cardiac output. The mechanism of action
is not certain. It may generate nitric oxide or act via other smooth muscle-relaxing
properties. The peak effect occurs approximately 3-5 hours after administration, and
the duration of effect on blood vessels is approximately l2 hours.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Hydralazine is used to dilate arterioles and decrease cardiac afterload. It is primarily
used for treatment of CHF, valvular disease of the heart, and other cardiovascular
disorders characterized by high peripheral vascular resistance. It may be used with
 da oy  d q si se u sn s si 
There are no well-controlled clinical studies or effcacy trials to document clinical
effectiveness. However, its use is not as common as other vasodilator drugs, such as
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects are attributed to excess vasodilation and subsequent hypotension,
which results in tachycardia. Hydralazine may dangerously decrease cardiac
output. Allergic reactions (lupus-like syndrome) have been reported in people
and are related to acetylator status but have not been reported in animals.
Repeated use will activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS).
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not use in hypotensive animals.
Drug Interactions
No specific drug interactions are reported for animals. However, use cautiously
with other drugs that may lower blood pressure.
Instructions for Use
Use of hydralazine in heart failure may accompany other drugs, such as digoxin,
pimobendan, and diuretics. Dosage in animals may be adjusted by monitoring blood
pressure.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor patients for hypotension. Monitor blood pressure to adjust dose.
Formulations
Hydralazine is available in 10-mg tablets and 20-mg/mL injection.
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature.
Exposure to light may change color and cause decomposition. Hydralazine is

Hydrochlorothiazide
hye-droe-klor-oh-thye'ah-zide
Trade and other names: HydroDiuril and generic
Functional classification: Diuretic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Thiazide diuretic. Like other thiazide diuretics, it inhibits sodium reabsorption in
distal renal tubules and causes urinary diuresis. Because thiazide diuretics act in the
distal tubules (at the point where most water has already been reabsorbed), their
diuretic effects are not as great as compared to loop diuretics such as furosemide.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Like other thiazide diuretics, hydrochlorothiazide is used to increase excretion of
sodium, potassium, and water. It also has been used as an antihypertensive. Because
thiazide diuretics decrease renal excretion of calcium, they also have been used to
treat uroliths containing calcium (calcium oxylate uroliths). Use in animals has been
primarily derived from anecdotal experience. There are no well-controlled clinical
studies or efficacy trials to document clinical effectiveness.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Hydrochlorothiazide may cause electrolyte imbalance such as hypokalemia.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not use in patient with high serum calcium. Thiazide diuretics will prevent
calcium excretion.
Drug Interactions
Use carefully with other diuretics. It may enhance the effects of other diuretics
and antihypertensive agents.

absorption, metabolism, and efficacy have not been studied in animals sufficiently
to predict or assess clinical use. However, hydrocodone has been used in animals as
an antitussive for symptomatic treatment of airway diseases and many clinicians
marketed for use in the US that do not contain atropine. (Canadian preparations
may contain only hydrocodone.) It may also contain other ingredients for treating
cough.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Like all opiates, side effects are predictable and unavoidable. Side effects include

Trade and other names: Hydrocortisone, Cortef and generic brands
Hydrocortisone sodium succinate, Solu-Cortef
Functional classification: Corticosteroid
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Glucocorticoid anti-inflammatory drug. Hydrocortisone has weaker anti
inflammatory effects and greater mineralocorticoid effects compared with
prednisolone or dexamethasone. Hydrocortisone has properties that most closely
and l/25 the potency of dexamethasone. Anti-inflammatory effects are complex but
are primarily via inhibition of inflammatory cells and suppression of expression of
inflammatory mediators.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Hydrocortisone is used for anti-inflammatory effects and for glucocorticoid
replacement therapy. Hydrocortisone is not used as commonly as other
corticosteroids such as prednisolone or dexamethasone, except when hormone
replacement to mimic effects of cortisol are needed. Hydrocortisone sodium
succinate is a rapid-acting injectable product that can be used when a prompt
response is needed.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Side effects from corticosteroids are many and include polyphagia, polydipsia/
polyuria, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression. Adverse
effects include GI ulceration, hepatopathy, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, decreased
thyroid hormone, decreased protein synthesis, delayed wound healing,
and immunosuppression. Secondary infections can occur as a result of
immunosuppression and include demodicosis, toxoplasmosis, fungal infections,
and UTIs. In horses, additional adverse effects include risk of laminitis
Contraindications and Precautions
 Use cautiously in patients prone to ulcers or infection or in animals in which
wound healing is necessary. Use cautiously in diabetic animals, animals with renal
failure, or pregnant animals.
Drug Interactions
Glucocorticoids are often synergistic with other anti-inflammatory and
immunosuppressive drugs. Administration of corticosteroids with nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) will increase the risk of GI injury.
Instructions for Use

Functional classification: Analgesic, Opiate
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
receptors on nerves and inhibits release of neurotransmitters involved with
transmission of pain stimuli (such as Substance P). Opiates also may inhibit release
of some inflammatory mediators. Central sedative and euphoric effects are related to
mu-receptor effects in brain. Hydromorphone has similar qualitative properties as
morphine but is six or seven times more potent than morphine. In dogs, the half-life
after IV administration was 70-80 minutes. Other opiates used in animals include
morphine, codeine, oxymorphone, meperidine, and fentanyl.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Hydromorphone is used in animals for analgesia and sedation and as an adjunct for
370 Hydromorphone
However, it is more potent than morphine and should be used at lower doses.
Because hydromorphone is less expensive than other opiates (e.g., oxymorphone),

times as potent as morphine and doses should be adjusted accordingly. Studies in
for producing sedation in dogs. In cats, duration of effect (0.l mg/kg) has been
6-7.5 hours.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Like all opiates, side effects from hydromorphone are predictable and
unavoidable. Side effects from administration include sedation, panting,
adverse effects are dysphoria, hypersalivation, and vomiting. Hyperthermia
also has been observed in cats, but the mechanism is not known. In dogs,
hydromorphone produces less histamine release than morphine administration
and therefore may produce fewer histamine-related side effects.
 Respiratory depression occurs with high doses. As with other opiates, a slight
decrease in heart rate is expected. In most cases this decrease does not have to be
treated with anticholinergic drugs (e.g., atropine) but should be monitored.
Tolerance and dependence occurs with chronic administration. In horses,
undesirable and even dangerous behavior actions can follow rapid intravenous
opioid administration. Horses should receive a preanesthetic of acepromazine or
an alpha2 agonist.
Contraindications and Precautions
Cats and horses are more sensitive to excitement than other species.
Drug Interactions
No significant interactions. Hydromorphone may be used with other anesthetics.
 If butorphanol is used, it may diminish the effects of hydromorphone by
antagonizing mu-opiate receptors.
Instructions for Use
Hydromorphone may be used interchangeably with morphine, provided that doses
are adjusted for potency differences. Administration to cats has been more effective
when injected IV, rather than IM or SQ, and resulted in faster onset with fewer
adverse effects. Oral tablets and solution are available for human use, but use has
not been reported for animals.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor patient's heart rate and respiration. Although bradycardia rarely needs to be
treated when it is caused by an opioid, if necessary atropine or glycopyrrolate can be
administered. If serious respiratory depression occurs, the opioid can be reversed
with naloxone. Monitor body temperature in cats. Hyperthermia has been observed
in patients postanesthesia.

Antineoplastic agent. Hydroxyurea is a cell-cycle-dependent agent, acting primarily
at the S-phase of mitosis. Exact mechanism of action is uncertain, but it may
interfere with DNA synthesis in cancer cells. The specific effects on red blood cells
(RBCs) occur because of the activity on hemoglobin.
Indications and Clinical Uses
In people, hydroxyurea is used for treatment of sickle cell anemia and occasionally
other carcinomas. In animals it has been used in combination with other anticancer
modalities for treatment of certain tumors. In animals one of the uses has been
treatment of polycythemia vera.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects

Hydroxyzine hydrochloride
hye-droks'ih-zeen
Trade and other names: Atarax, Vistaril
Functional classification: Antihistamine
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antihistamine (H, blocker) of the piperazine class. Like other antihistamines,
hydroxyzine acts by blocking the H receptor and suppresses inflammatory reactions
caused by histamine. The H, blockers have been used to control prurnitus and skin
inflammation, rhinorrhea, and airway inflammation. Hydroxyzine also has sedative
properties and other calming effects on the central nervous system that are not
related to the antihistamine effects.
Another antihistamine, cetirizine, is an active metabolite of hydroxyzine.
In dogs, most of the antihistamine effect of the administration of hydroxyzine
is from the formation of cetirizine, which occurs readily after IV and oral
administration.
Hydroxyzine hydrochloride  373
Indications and Clinical Uses
 In animals it has been used to treat pruritus. Effcacy in animals for treating pruritus
is low. Although it has been shown in experimental animals to suppress histamine
response, it has not been consistently effective relieving pruritus in dogs with atopic
dermatitis. Other uses include allergic airway disease and rhinitis. However, efficacy
 is not established for these uses. In people, additional uses include treatment of
anxiety and psychoneurosis and as a sedative before and after general anesthesia.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Sedation is the most common side effect. Sedation is the result of inhibition of
histamine N-methyltransferase. Sedation may also be attributed to block of other
CNS receptors such as those for serotonin, acetylcholine, and alpha-receptors.

376  lbuprofen
Ibuprofen
eye-byoo-proe'fen
Trade and Other Names: Motrin, Advil, and Nuprin
Functional Classification: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Like other NSAIDs in this class, ibuprofen produces analgesic and anti-inflammatory
effects by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins. The enzyme inhibited by
NSAIDs is the cyclo-oxygenase enzyme (COX). The COX enzyme exists in two
prostaglandins important for maintaining a healthy GI tract, renal function, platelet
finction, and other normal functions. COX-2 is induced and responsible for
fever. However,it is known that there is some crossover of COX-1 and COX-2
effects in some situations and COX-2 activity is important for some biological
effects. Ibuprofen is not selective for either COX-1 or COX-2. Ibuprofen is
registered for human use, and experience with this drug in veterinary medicine is
limited.
Pharmacokinetics have been studied in a vaniety of animals. In horses, the half
lfe is approximately 60-90 minutes. Oral absorption is high in horses (80%-90%)
regardless of the dose form used, including a compounded paste. Ibuprofen was
90%-100% absorbed when administered orally to dairy goats.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Ibuprofen is not registered for any animals in veterinary medicine. There are drugs
in small animals that have been safer for the GI tract and are preferred. Use of
ibuprofen in dogs is discouraged because of high risk of GI ulceration. It has been
used for musculoskeletal inflammation in horses and ruminants. Administration of
25 mg/kg IV to cows reduced some systemic variables in endotoxin-induced
mastitis.
 In horses, doses of 10-25 mg/kg have been used, but clinical trials of efficacy
have not been reported.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Vomiting, severe gastrointestinal ulceration, and hemorhage have been reported
in dogs. Like other NSAIDs, renal injury caused by decrease renal perfusion has
Contraindications and Precautions

Imipenem + Cilastatin
ih-mih-pen'em + sye-lah-stat'in
Trade and Other Names: Primaxin
Functional Classification: Antibacterial
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Imipenem + cilastatin is a beta-lactam antibiotic of the carbapenems class with a
broad spectrum of activity. Action on the cell wall is similar to other beta-lactams,
which is to bind penicillin-binding proteins (PBP) that weaken or interfere with cell
wall formation. The carbapenems are capable of binding to a specific PBP (PBP-1)
that results in more rapid lysis compared to other beta-lactams. This results in
greater bactericidal activity and a longer postantibiotic effect. Carbapenems have
a broad spectrum of activity and are among the most active of all antibiotics.
Spectrum includes gram-negative bacilli, including Enterobn cterincene and
Imipenem + Cilastatin 379
Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It also is active against most gram-positive bacteria,
except methicillin-resistant strains of Stapiylococcns and Enterococcus. Compared
to imipenem, meropenem and doripenem are slightly more active. Cilastatin
has no antibacterial activity, but it is a specific inhibitor of renal dipeptidase,
dehydropeptidase (DHP-I). Therefore, cilastatin blocks renal tubular metabolism of
Indications and Clinical Uses
Imipenem is used pnimanily for infections caused by bactenia resistant to other
Psendomonasaeruginosa,Escherichia coli,and Klebsiella pnenmonine.Although
resistant strains), other less expensive drugs should be used for gram-positive
infections. Meropenem and doripenem are newer drugs in the class of carbapenems
and have some advantages with respect to activity and convenience of
administration.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Allergic reactions may occur with beta-lactam antibiotics. With rapid infusion
or in patients with renal insufficiency neurotoxicity may occur. Neurotoxicity
possible, but imipenem is combined with cilastatin to decrease renal metabolism.
Vomiting and nausea are possible. Intramuscular injections can cause painful
reactions.
Contraindications and Precautions
 Use cautiously in patients prone to seizures. Seizures may be more likely in
patients with renal failure.
Drug Interactions
No known drug interactions. Do not mix with other drugs in vial.
Instructions for Use
Doses and efficacy studies have not been determined in animals. Recommendations
are based on extrapolation of studies performed in humans. Reserve the use of this
drug for resistant, refractory infections. Observe manufacturer's instructions carefully
for proper administration. When the vial is initially reconstituted, it should not
be given IV. It frst must be diluted in a suitable intravenous fluid solution {at
least l00 mL). For intravenous administration, add to intravenous fluids. After
reconstitution in vial, 250 or 500 mg should be added to not less than 100 mL of

Indications and Clinical Uses
Indomethacin, like other NSAIDs, has been used to treat pain and inflammation
in people. However, indomethacin has not been used often in clinical veterinary
medicine because other safer, registered drugs are available. Indomethacin is used as
a prototypical nonselective COX-1 and COX-2 blocker in research. In dogs, the
high risk of GI ulceration prohibits its routine use.

insulin, Glargine insulin, NPH insulin, Caninsulin, Protamine zinc insulin (PZI),
Humulin (human insulin; discontinued), Vetsulin is porcine insulin zinc
suspension (veterinary), and PZI Vet (veteninary protamine zinc insulin)
Functional Classification: Hormone
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Insulin has multiple effects associated with utilization of glucose. Dog insulin is
identical to pork insulin, and cat insulin is similar to beef insulin with only one
amino acid difference. Most beef-pork insulin combinations for humans have been
discontinued and are not usually available for veterinary use. Human-recombinant
insulins can be used in dogs and cats with the same effects as natural insulin. Insulin
is available in several preparations:
1. Regular insulin: Short acting. Peak is l-5 hours and duration is 4-l0 hours.
 2. Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (isophane, also called NPH, and Humulin or
Novolin): A human-recombinant insulin of crystalline suspension with
protamine zinc that is intermediate acting. Peak is 2-10 hours in dogs and 2-8
hours in cats with a duration of action of 4-24 hours in dogs and 4-12 hours
in cats {but usually 2-3 hours in cats).
3. Lente insulin. Peak is 2-10 hours in dogs and 2-8 hours in cats with a
duration of action of 4-24 hours in dogs and 4-12 hours in cats. Addition of
 protamine or zinc to insulin will produce a crystallized insulin in suspension
that has a longer absorption rate than dissolved insulin. The lente forms of
insulin control their duration by the size of the crystal. For example, semilente
is practically amorphous, whereas ultralente has large crystals, and lente is a
combination of ultralente and semilente.
4. Ultralente insulin: Peak is 4-l6 hours in dogs and 2-14 hours in cats and
has a duration of 8-28 hours in dogs and 12-24 hours in cats. It is poorly
absorbed in cats and usually not recommended.
 5. Vetsulin: Also known as Caninsulin. Vetsulin is a U-40 porcine insulin,
identical to canine insulin in amino acid content, and is a lente insulin of
aqueous zinc suspension of crystaline and noncrystalline insulins. It produces a
shorter peak of activity (4 hours) and duration than PZI insulin. This product
has been temporarily suspended by some sources.
6. Protamine-zinc insulin (PZI): Developed from recombinant human insulin
and long acting. Veterinary form is called ProZinc in a 40 unit/mL form for
            i
people. Peak is 4-14 hours in dogs and 5-7 hours in cats, with a duration of
6-28 hours in dogs and cats. PZI insulin of animal origin (90% bovine and
10% porcine) has been unavailable.
384Insulin
7. Glargine insulin: A human insulin analogue made from recombinant
technology. It has a slow onset of 4-18 hours and a duration of 24 hours or
 a go uoqns a  od si e s 
asparagine and addition of two arginine molecules. These changes shift the
isoelectric point toward neutral, which reduces solubility at the pH of SQ
fissue and causes it to be released slowly from the injection site, without a
and trough. It has four amino acid differences from feline insulin. The
glucose-lowering properties are shorter in cats than in people, with a peak at
16 hours and duration of 24 hours. However, it produces greater glycemic
insulin in cats. Despite the long-lasting effect, optimum control is achieved
with twice-daily dosing in cats with Glargine insulin.
 8. Insulin detemir (Levemir): Long-acting insulin. Insulin detemir has a 14
carbon fatty acid chain, which decreases absorption, and is highly bound to
albumin. Duration is 6-24 hours in people, with peak at 6-8 hours, but has
not been established for animals.
9. Insulin glulisine (Apidra), insulin lispro (Humalog), and insulin aspart
(NovoLog): Rapidly acting insulins used in people. They are used for their
rapid onset and short duration of action. In people, they are typically used
with a meal and combined with a longer-acting form. These rapid-acting
insulin analogues have not been evaluated for animals.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Insulin, in the various forms, is used to treat diabetes mellitus in dogs and cats. It is
used to replace insulin that is deficient. In some cats (approximately 50%) some oral
hypoglycemic dnugs have been used to reduce use of insulin. However, diabetic
dogs are more insulin dependent. Regular insulin is short acting and more useful for
Intemmediate or long-acting insulin preparations are used for maintenance and
are available in a variety of forms (see previous). Most of the animal sources of
insulin (beef and pork) have been discontinued and human recombinant insulin
fomulations have been substituted without differences in efficacy. In cats, glargine
insulin has shown better efficacy than other forms and has been associated with a
better remission rate. In addition to diabetes mellitus, insulin is occasionally used to
treat severe cases of hyperkalemia.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects primarily related to overdoses that result in hypoglycemia.
Glargine insulin has a low pH (4) and may sting from injection. Other
insulins are more neutral.
Contraindications and Precautions
 Do not use without the ability to monitor glucose in animals because of the risk of
hypoglycemia. Mixing regular insulin and insulins containing zincin the same
syringe will prolong absorption of the regular insulin. Do not mix isophane insulin
or phosphate- buffered insulin with zinc insulins (lente, ultralente, semilente).
Drug Interactions
Administration of corticosteroids (predmisolone, dexamethasone, etc.) will
interfere with action of insulin.
Insulin385
Instructions for Use
Dietary management is essential for optimal glucose control. Feed cats a high-
protein, low-carbohydrate diet. Feed dogs a high-fiber, low-fat diet.Doses should be
For cats with ketoacidosis, alternative dosing regimen has used 0.2 units/kg IM
initially, then 0.l units/kg IM every hour until the glucose level is less than 300,
then 0.25-0.4 units/kg q6h SQ. With most forms of insulin (including protamine
zinc insulin and Glargine insulin) in cats, twice-daily dosing usually is required.
However, consider once-daily dosing in cats if blood glucose nadir develops 10
hours or longer after administration. Pet owners are instructed to use appropriate
syringe types for administration (e.g., U-40 vs. U-100). Many cats, if properly
managed, may go into remission and not require lifelong insulin treatment.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, and/or fructosamine
concentrations. When treating diabetes, it is desirable to maintain glucose

80-150 mg/dL. Serum fructosamine concentrations also can be monitored with
the following guidance: ≤450 μmol/L good control; 450-500 μmol/L moderate
control; >500 μmol/L poor control.
Formulations
Insulin is usually available in 100 units/mL injection (U-100), with some products
available in smaller concentration of 40 units/mL (U-40, e.g., ProZinc or Vetsulin).
Protamine zinc beef-pork (PZI VET) insulin also may be available as 40 units/mL
injection (U-40). Some previously available insulin products have been discontinued,
such as Iletin II Pork Insulin (Regular and NPH formulations), Humulin U
Ultralente, and Humulin L Lente (Humulin U and Humulin L).
StabilityandStorage
Proper storage is critical for proper action of insulin: Keep reffigerated. Warm gently
and roll vial prior to injection to ensure proper mixing of vial contents. Do not
freeze vials of insulin. Do not allow vials of insulin exposure to heat. Do not
mix types of insulin in the same vial or syringe. Veterinarians should not use
formulations of insulin that are compounded in unreliable conditions. Dilution of
insulin should only be done by a pharmacist because specific diluents must be used.

is not well established, it is administered as an adjunctive for zygomycosis,
conidiobolomycosis, and fingal granuloma. The mechanism of action against fungal
organisms is not known. Iodide is also important for thyroid gland finction and has
been used to treat some thyroid disorders.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Ethylenediamine dihydroiodide is used as a nutritional source of iodine in cattle.
 Iodide has been used to treat fungal granulomatous disease and infections associated
with zygomycetes. The antifungal treatment has been questioned for animals
because the efficacy is not established. Because it may increase respiratory secretions,
it has been used as an expectorant, but the efficacy has not been established. In
 people, iodide has been used to treat hyperthyroidism, but effectivness for this use
 in cats has not been established. Potassium iodide is also used to protect the thyroid
gland from radiation injury in the event of a radiation emergency (accidental
exposure to radiation) or following administration of radioactive iodide. In cattle, in
addition to a feed supplement, EDDI is used as an expectorant and as an aid in the
treatment of bovine infertility. EDDI is sometimes added to the feed of cattle for
the purpose of decreasing foot rot infections, lumpy jaw ( Aetinomyces bovis), woody
tongue (Actinobacillus lignieresi), and bronchitis. There is a lack of published
scientific evidence for a beneficial effect. In horses iodine is used to treat
sporotrichosis, and occasionally other fungal infections such as basidiobolomycosis
and conidiobolomycosis (Zygomycosis). For horses, treatment is initiated with doses
4 weeks beyond resolution of clinical signs.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Iodide adverse reactions (iodism) include excess lacrimation, swelling of eyelids,
nonproductive cough, increased respiratory secretions, and dermatitis. Its use may
cause abortion in horses or limb defomities in foals.
Contraindications and Precautions
 Do not use in pregnant animals.
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions have been reported for small animals
Instructions for Use
Iodide has been administered as a l-g/mL potassium iodine solution (SSKI) or as a
65-mg/mL solution. It also has been administered as a 10% potassium iodide/5%
iodine solution given orally with food.
In cattle, EDDI is administered in the feed or mixed with feed, salt, or mineral
mixture or in the drinking water.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor serum thyroid concentrations with prolonged use.
Formulations
Available for food animals as EDDI: equivalent to 4.6% EDDI or 46 mg/g of
EDDI. Also available as potassium iodide as l g/mL potassium iodide solution
(SSKI) or a 65-mg/mL oral solution or l0% potassium iodide/5% iodine solution.

Ipecac
ih'peh-kak
Functional Classification: Emetic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Emetic drug. Ipecac contains two alkaloids: cephalin and emetine. These alkaloids
 () az  i a   i s 
stimulate vomiting.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Ipecac is indicated for emergency treatment of poisoning. When used in animals, it
should be administered promptly after poisoning. Inducing vomiting with ipecac is
not effective beyond 30-60 minutes after poisoning. After successfil administration,
it is estimated that vomiting removes only 10%-60% of ingested toxicant. Therefore,
other systemic antidotes and/or activated charcoal should also be considered.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
No adverse effects with acute therapy for poisoning. Chronic administration can
lead to myocardial toxicity.
390 lpodate, lopanoic Acid
Contraindications and Precautions
 Do not induce vomiting if the patient has ingested caustic chemicals or if there is
a nisk of aspiration pneumonia.
Drug Interactions
Ipecac is not as effective if drugs that act as antiemetics have been administered.
Such drugs include tranquilizers (e.g., acepromazine), anticholinergics (e.g.*
atropine), antihistamines, and prokinetic agents (e.g., metoclopramide).
Instructions for Use
Ipecac is available as nonprescription drug. Onset of vomiting may require 20-30
minutes.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Poisoned animals should be monitored closely because ipecac may not entirely
eliminate ingested toxicant.
Formulations
Ipecac is available in a 30-mL bottle oral solution.

Ipodate, lopanoic Acid
ih'poe-date and i-oh-pa-noe'-ik as-id
Trade and Other Names: Orografin, Calcium ipodate, Iodopanoic acid
Functional Classification: Antithyroid agent
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Cholecystographic agent. This drug is an iodinated biliary radiocontrast dye. Ipodate
inhibits deiodinases responsible for conversion of thyroid hormone T4 to T3. It also
blocks T3 receptors. It lowers the T-3 level but not the T-4 levels.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Ipodate is used as treatment for hyperthyroidism in cats. Reduction of T3 levels
should occur within l week. The use is not as common as other treatments, but
it has been administered as an alternative to methimazole, radiation therapy, or
surgery. Response rate may be as high as 66%. Ipodate fomulations may not be
lpodate, lopanoic Acid 391
available to veterinarians and iopanoic acid has been used as a substitute. If iopanoic
acid (Telepaque) is used as a substitute, it may be less effective.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Ipodate can cause hypothyroidism. No significant adverse effects have been
reported in cats, but compounds containing iodide have caused hypersensitivity
reactions in people. In humans, chronic high doses of compounds containing
iodide can cause sore mouth, swollen tissues, skin reactions, or GI upset.
Contraindications and Precautions
Monitor for reduction of thyroid levels in animals or clinical signs. Relapses have
occurred in cats after l0 weeks to 6 months of treatment.
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions have been reported for small animals
Instructions for Use
 Use of ipodate has been experimental, and precise doses have not been evaluated. In
one study, two thirds of treated cats responded. More experience is needed to
determine if response to treatment is transient.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor serum thyroid T3 concentrations. Ipodate lowers the T-3 level but the T-4
levels may be unchanged or may increase because of decreased conversion of T4
to T3.
Formulations
Ipodate has been available as either calcium or sodium ipodate. Oragrafin 500-mg
capsules have been formulated into 50-mg capsules by pharmacists. (These may have
to be specifically formulated for cats.) Availability of Orografin has become a
problem for veterinarians and iopanoic acid (Telepaque) has been used as a
substitute. It is formulated into capsules for cats.
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature.
Small Animal Dosage
Cats
· Ipodate: 15 mg/kg ql2h PO. Most common dose has been 50 mg/cat twice
daily. Dose is equivalent regardless of whether sodium or calcium ipodate is used.

392 Irbesartan
Irbesartan
er-beh-sar'tan
Trade and Other Names: Avapro
Functional Classification: Vasodilator
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Vasodilator. Angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). Irbesartan has been shown
to block angiotensin II receptors and prevent the effects associated with
angiotensin II. It has been used in people who cannot tolerate angiotension-
converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The metabolism in dogs and cats is
uncertain and it is not known if doses extrapolated from human use have equivalent
activity in dogs and cats. Losartan, another ARB, is used as an alternative in people
but is reportedly not effective in dogs because they do not produce the active
metabolite.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Angiotensin II blockers, such as irbesartan, are used in people as alternatives to ACE
inhibitors. However, they are rarely used in animals because most animals tolerate
ACE inhibitors well. Use of ARB in animals has been primarily derived from
empirical use. There are no well-controlled clinical studies or efficacy trials to
document clinical effectiveness.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
No adverse effects have been reported in animals. Hypotension is a potential
 problem from overdosing.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not administer to hypotensive or dehydrated animals. No other
contraindications have been reported for animals.

Itraconazole
it-rah-kahn'ah-zole
Trade and Other Names: Sporanox and Itrafungol (available in Europe for cats)
Functional Classification: Antifungal
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Azole (triazole) antifingal drug. Itraconazole inhibits ergosterol synthesis in fungal
cell membrane. Fungistatic. It is active against dermatophytes and systemic fungi,
such as Blastomyces, Histoplasmn, and Coccidioides. It is more potent against these
Itraconazole403
fungi than ketoconazole. Itraconazole can be incorporated into sebum and stratum
corneum and can be detected in skin for 3-4 weeks after treatment.
Experience in dogs and cats has shown it to be absorbed orally and doses have
been established for treating systemic fungal infections and dermatophytes. In
horses, the oral solution is better absorbed than the capsules (65% vs. 12%). The
half-life for the solution is ll hours.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Itraconazole is used to treat dermatophytes and systemic fungi, such as Blastomyces,
Histoplasma, and Coccidioides. It also has been shown effective for treatment of
Malasezia dermatitis, but doses are lower than for other infections (see dosing
section). Although it has been used to treat infections caused by aspergillosis,
efficacy has not been as good as with other antifungal drugs such as voriconazole or
infections in cats.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Itraconazole is better tolerated than ketoconazole. Ketoconazole inhibits
homone synthesis and can lower concentrations of cortisol, testosterone, and
other homones in animals. However, itraconazole has little effect on these
enzymes and will not produce endocnine effects. However, vomiting and
hepatotoxicity are possible, especially at high doses. In one study, hepatotoxicity
was more likely at high doses. Some l0%-15% of dogs will develop high liver
enzyme levels. Itraconazole has produced skin lesions in dogs, consisting of
vasculitis, sterile suppurative skin lesions, and ulcerative skin lesions. High doses
in cats caused vomiting and anorexia.
Contraindications and Precautions
Dose with food for best oral absorption. Compounded fomulations may not be
bioequivalent to proprietary forms. Use cautiously in any animal with signs of
iver disease. Use cautiously in pregnant animals. At high doses in laboratory
animals, it has caused fetal abnormalities.
Drug Interactions
Antiacid drugs (proton pump inhibitors or H-receptor blockers) will
decrease oral absorption. Itraconazole is a cytochrome P450 enzyme inhibitor.
It may cause drug interactions because of inhibition of P450 enzymes.
The extent of cytochrome P450 inhibition is not as high as for ketoconazole
but may be important for some of the low therapeutic index drugs
(see Appendix).
Instructions for Use
Administer with food for best absorption, unless the oral solution is used. Doses
are based on studies in animals in which itraconazole has been used to treat
blastomycosis in dogs. Lower doses may be used in cats and dogs for dermatophytes
and in dogs for treating Malassezin dermatitis. Doses in horses are based on specific
pharmacokinetic studies. Other uses or doses are based on empinicism or
extrapolation from human literature.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor liver enzyme concentrations.

FormulationsAvailable
Itraconazole is available in 100-mg capsules and 10-mg/mL oral liquid.
Itrafungol for cats is l0-mg/mL oral liquid (available in Europe).
Stability and Storage
Itraconazole is practically insoluble in water but is soluble in ethanol. It is unstable
and may lose potency if not maintained in manufacturer's original formulation
(capsules and solution). Compounded formulations are highly unstable and
insoluble. Oral absorption of extemporaneously compounded itraconazole
suspensions and capsules has been poor and is not recommended. Oral commercial
formulation (in cyclodextran) has a pH of approximately 2.0 and the pH should be
maintained to ensure optimal absorption. Do not freeze.

eye-ver-mek'tin
Trade and Other Names: Heartguard, Ivomec, Eqvalan liquid, Equimectrin,
IverEase, Zimecterin, Privermectin, Ultramectin, Ivercide, Ivercare, and Ivermax.
Acarexx is a topical form for cats.
Functional Classification: Antiparasitic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antiparasitic drug. Avermectins (ivermectin-like drugs) and milbemycins (milbemycin
and moxidectin) are macrocyclic lactones and share similanities, including mechanism
chloride ion channels in parasites. Paralysis and death of the parasite are caused by
increased permeability to chloride ions and hyperpolarization of nerve cells. These
drugs also potentiate other chloride channels, including ones gated by GABA.
Mammals ordinarily are not affected because they lack glutamate-gated chlonide
vermectin405
channels, and there is a lower affinity for other mammalian chloride channels. Because
these drugs ordinarily do not penetrate the blood-brain bamrier, GABA-gated
channels in the CNS of mammals are not affected. Ivermectin is active against
intestinal parasites, mites, bots, heartworm microfilaria, and developing larvae.
Ivermectin can also produce heartworm adulticide effects when administered long-
term. Ivermectin has no effect on trematode or cestode parasites.
Indications and Clinical Uses
 Ivermectin is used in horses for the treatment and control of large strongyles (adult)
(Strongyins vulgaris, Strongylns edentatns, and Triodontophorusspecies), small
strongyles (adult and fourth stage larvae) (Cyathostomnm species, Cylicocyclus species,
Cylicostephanns species), pinworms (adult and fourth-stage larvae) (Oxyuris eqni),
largeroundworms(adult)(Parascarisegnornm),hairwomms(adult)(Trichostrongyins
axet),large mouth stomach worms (adult) (Habronema mnscae),neck threadworms
(microfilaniae) (Onchocerca species), and stomach bots (Gastrophiinsspecies). In cattle
it is used for treatment and control of GI nematodes (adults and fourth-stage larvae)
(Haemonchus placei,Ostertagia ostertagi)(includinginhibited larvae),O.lyrata,
Trichostrongyinsaxei,T.coiubriformis,Cooperia oncophora,C.punctata,C.pectinata,
Oesophagostomnm radiatnm, Nematodirus helvetianns(adults only),N.spathiger
(adults only), Bnnostomnm phiebotomnm; lungworms (adults and fourth-stage larvae)
(Dictyocanlns viviparns); grubs (parasitic stages) (Hypoderma bovis, H. lineatnm);
sucking lice (Linognathns vitnli,Haemntopinns ewrysternns, Solenopotes capillatus);and
mites (scabies)(Psoroptes ovis[syn. P. commnnis var. bovis], Sarcoptes scabiei var. bovis).
In pigs it is used for treatment and control of GI roundworms (adults and
fourth-stage larvae) (large roundworm, Ascaris swwm; red stomach worm,
Hyostrongyius rubidus; nodular worm, Oesophagostomum species; threadworm,
Strongyloides ransomi (adults only); somatic roundworm larvae (threadworm,
Strongyloides ransomi [somatic larvae]); lungworms (Metastrongyins species [adults
only]);lice(Haemntopinns suis);and mites (Sarcoptes scabietvar.snis).
In small animals (dogs and cats) it is used as a heartworm preventative {low dose)
or to treat external parasites (mites) and intestinal parasites at higher doses. The
benefit for heartworm prophylaxis in animals is the ability to kill young larvae, older
larvae, and immature or young adults and adult filariae. Ivermectin is an effective
microfilaricide after adulticide therapy. Ivermectin has been recommended by the
America Heartworm Society to treat heartworm positive dogs for 2-3 months prior to
adulticide therapy. This allows immature worms to reach full maturity that are more
susceptible to melarsomine, as well as preventing new infection. Ivermectin can also
reduce numbers of adult heartworms when administered long-term at preventive
doses. For optimal heartworm adulticide effect, it is often administered with oral
doxycycline (l0 mg/kg per day) for several months. Treatment of Demodexinfections
is effective but requires higher doses than for any other indication.
Precautionary Tnformation
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Toxicity may occur at high doses and in breeds in which ivermectin crosses the
blood-brain barnier. Sensitive breeds include Collies, Australian shepherds, Old
vision, coma, and death. Sensitivity to ivermectin occurs in certain breeds because
of a mutation in the multidrug resistance gene (MDRl) that codes for the
membrane pump P-glycoprotein (p-gp). This mutation affects the efflux pump in
the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, ivermectin can accumulate in the brain of
406 vermectin
susceptible animals. High doses in normal animals may also produce similar
toxicosis. Most nonsusceptible dogs can tolerate doses of l00-400 mcg/kg. But
sensitive breeds (dogs with MDR mutation) may exhibit toxicity at doses of
150-340 mcg/kg. Ivermectin at doses of 400 mcg/kg has produced neurological
toxicosis in Siamese kittens, and doses as low as 300 mcg/kg have been lethal in
kittens. Retinopathy has also been observed in dogs administered high doses. In
affected animals, a sudden onset of blindness and/or mydriasis may occur, but
dogs recover if the drug is discontinued. In horses, adverse reactions may include
itching because of effects on microfilaniae.
Contraindications and Precautions
numbers of microfilaremia may show adverse reactions to high doses. If dogs are
sensitive to ivermectin {see earlier list of breeds), they may be sensitive to other
drugs in this class (avemectins). Ivermectin at approved clinical doses for
treatment of endoparasites or heartworm prevention has been safe in pregnant
animals. At high doses used for treating demodicosis, safety is not known, but
there have been no reports of teratogenic effects. In the most sensitive laboratory
animal (mouse) the lowest dose that is teratogenic is 400 mcg/kg. Dogs with
MDR mutation may also be sensitive to other drugs such as loperamide,
milbemycin, moxidectin, and anticancer drugs. Ivermectin is excreted in milk.
Drug Interactions

ivermectin across the blood-brain bamier. Such drugs include ketoconazole,
itraconazole, cyclosporine, and calcium-channel blockers.
Instructions for Use
Ivermectin is used in a wide range of animals for internal and external parasites.
prevention is the lowest dose; other parasites require higher doses. Heartguard and a
topical form are the only forms approved for small animals; for other indications,
large animal injectable products are often administered PO, IM, or SQ to small
animals. Do not administer IV. Injections in pigs should be made in the neck only.
Because some dogs may be sensitive to ivermectin, if a dog has not previously
received ivermectin and high doses are needed (e.g., to treat Demodex), start with a
low dose (50-100 mcg/kg), then increase by increments of 50-100 mcg/kg/day on
subsequent doses every day. During this increase the dog should be observed for
signs of CNS toxicity (ataxia, tremors, sedation). Once the maintenance dose is
achieved, it should be administered once daily until 4 weeks after the second
consecutive negative monthly skin scraping.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor for microfilaremia prior to administration in small animals. For other parasitic
infections, confirm successful treatment with fecal examinations or skin scrapings.
Formulations

Kanamycin Sulfate 409
Kanamycin Sulfate
kan-ah-mye'sin sul'fate
Trade and Other Names: Kantrim
Functional Classification: Antibacterial
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Aminoglycoside antibiotic. Bactericidal. Like other aminoglycosides, kanamycin acts
to inhibit bactenia protein synthesis via binding to 3oS ribosome. Kanamycin has a
broad spectrum of activity that includes Staphylococws spp. and gram-negative bacilli.
It has weak activity against streptococci and anaerobic bacteria. Kanamycin is not as
active against most bacteria as gentamicin or amikacin.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Kanamycin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic used to treat gram-negative infections.
It is less active than gentamicin, amikacin, or tobramycin. Therefore, there is little
advantage for using kanamycin over the other drugs in this class.
Precautionary Information
K
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Nephrotoxicity is the most dose-limiting toxicity. Ensure that patients have
adequate fluid and electrolyte balance during therapy. Ototoxicity and
vestibulotoxicity also are possible.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not use in animals with renal disease. Do not use in dehydrated animals.
Drug Interactions
When used with anesthetic agents, neuromuscular blockade is possible with high
doses. Do not mix in vial or syringe with other antibiotics. Ototoxicity and
nephrotoxicity are potentiated by loop diuretics such as furosemide.
Instructions for Use
Kanamycin is not as active as other aminoglycosides. For serious infections consider
gentamicin or amikacin.

Kaolin + Pectin
kay'oh-lin + pek'tin
Trade and Other Names: Generic brands only
Functional Classification: Antidiarrheal
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antidiarrheal compound. Kaolin is a form of aluminum silicate and pectin is a
carbohydrate that is extracted from the ninds of citrus fruits. This product has a
claim to act as a demulcent and adsorbent in the treatment of diarrhea. The action
of kaolin-pectin is believed to be related to binding of bacterial toxins (endotoxins
and enterotoxins) in the GI tract. However, experimental studies have shown that
kaolin-pectin has been an ineffective binder of E. coli enterotoxin and clinical studies
have failed to show a benefit from the administration of kaolin-pectin. This product
may change the consistency of stools, but it will not decrease fluid or electrolyte
loss, nor will it shorten the duration of illness. Kao-Pectate formulations contain
salicylate as one of the active ingredients.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Kaolin and pectin combinations are used for the symptomatic treatment of acute
diarrhea. Despite the lack of clinical evidence of efficacy, some veterinarians
administer this drug for short-term treatment. Commercial forms that contain
salicylate (8.68 mg/mL) may have anti-inflammatory effects to decrease secretory
diarrhea caused by bacteria.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Side effects are uncommon. There is 8.7-mg/mL salicylate in the regular
strength and l6 mg/mL in the extra-strength formulation. Because some animals
may be sensitive to salicylates, this ingredient in the formulation should be
considered before administering to animals.
Contraindications and Precautions
No specific contraindications in animals.
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions are reported. However, the kaolin component may prevent
kaolin-pectin to avoid drug interaction.
Instructions for Use
Kaolin-pectin may not change the course of diarrhea but may change the character
of the feces.
Ketamine Hydrochloride 4ll
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
No specific monitoring is necessary.
Formulations
Kaolin-pectin is no longer found in the product Kao Pectate (previously available in
a 12 oz. oral suspension). All formulations for Kao-Pectate contain bismuth

Ketamine Hydrochloride
ket'ah-meen hye-droe-kloride
Trade and Other Names: Ketalar, Ketavet, and Vetalar
Functional Classification: Anesthetic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Anesthetic agent. Exact mechanism of action is not known, but most evidence
supports its action as a centrally acting dissociative agent. Ketamine produces mild
analgesia and modulates pain via its ability to act as a noncompetitive antagonist for
 go ro b  s a 'd (a) e- a
isomers (R-ketamine and S-ketamine). S-ketamine is more active and eliminated
faster. Ketamine is rapidly metabolized in most animals (60-90 minute half-life in
dogs); however, metabolite (norketamine) may produce more prolonged NMDA
antagonistic effects.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Ketamine is used for short-term anesthetic procedures. Duration of action is
on NMDA receptors and has been administered as an adjunct to other analgesic
medications, usually with opiates, sometimes as a slow continuous rate infusion
4l2 Ketamine Hydrochloride
(CRI). Ketamine is often combined in use with other anesthetics and sedatives such
as benzodiazepines (diazepam) or alpha2 agonists (medetomidine, dexmedetomidine,
and xylazine). Such combinations have been synergistic and allowed lower doses of
each individual component. One example of a combination is MLK, which is
morphine (or fentanyl), lidocaine, and ketamine.
Although ordinarily contraindicated in patients with epilepsy, it has been used to
treat cases of refractory status epilepticus through its NMDA receptor effects.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Ketamine causes pain with intramuscular injection (pH of solution is 3.5).
Tremors, muscle spasticity, and convulsive seizures have been reported.
common in dogs when high doses are used. Ketamine will increase heart rate
and blood pressure as a result of an increase in sympathetic tone. It will produce
an increased cardiac output compared to other anesthetic agents. Salivation,
mydriasis, and regurgitation are increased in animals that receive ketamine, which
may be reduced by premedication within atropine. Apnea may develop in some
animals, and oxygen supplementation should be provided.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not use in animals with head injury because it may elevate cerebral spinal
fluid (CSF) pressure. Use cautiously, if at all, in animals with glaucoma (increases
intraocular pressure). Do not use in animals prone to seizures (although some
animals with seizures have been successfully treated with ketamine).
Drug Lnteractions
Ketamine hydrochlonide is maintained at an acidic pH for stability and solubility.
If mixed with alkalinizing solutions, instability or precipitation can result.
Instructions for Use
Ketamine is often used in combination with other anesthetics and anesthetic adjuncts.
such as xylazine, dexmedetomidine, medetomidine, acepromazine, opiates, and
benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam). Constant rate infusions (CRI) may be used
to maintain a plane of anesthesia and analgesia. To prepare CRI, 0.6 mL (60 mg) may
be added to l L of fluids and infuse at a rate of l0 mL/kg for analgesia. For use in
cats, a sedative such as acepromazine {O.1 mg/kg) or a benzodiazepine is
recommended prior to administration of ketamine. Intravenous doses are generally
less than intramuscular doses. In cats, ketamine may be sprayed into the mouth
(10 mg/kg) and produces similar effects as IM injection. Animals receiving ketamine
will have open eyelids, and artificial tears should be applied to prevent corneal injury.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor heart rate and breathing in patients anesthetized with ketamine.
Formulations
Ketamine is available in 100-mg/mL injection solution.
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature.

Ketoconazole
kee-toe-kah'nah-zole
Trade and Other Names: Nizoral
Functional Classification: Antifungal
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Azole (imidazole) antifungal drug. Ketoconazole has a similar mechanism of
action as other azole antifungal agents (itraconazole and fluconazole). It inhibits a
414 Ketoconazole
Fungistatic. It has antifungal activity against dermatophytes and a variety of systemic
fungi, such as Histoplasma, Blastomyces, and Coccidioides and Malassezin yeast. Other
azole antifungal drugs include voriconazole, itraconazole, and fluconazole.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Ketoconazole is used in dogs, cats, and some exotic animals to treat dermatophytes
and systemic fungi, such as Blastomyces, Histoplasmn, and Coccidioides. It also has
been shown effective for treatment of Malassezin dermatitis. It does not have good
activity against Aspergillus. Ketoconazole should not be used in horses because oral
absorption is poor unless administered with a highly acidic vehicle. In dogs, it has a
profound effect on cytochrome P450 enzymes and will inhibit metabolism of many
drugs. This property has been used to reduce doses of cyclosporine (ketoconazole
dose of 5-10 mg/kg). It is also via the inhibition of steroid P450 biosynthesis that
ketoconazole has been used as a treatment for canine hyperadrenocorticism (canine
Cushing's disease).
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects in animals include dose-related vomiting, diarrhea, hepatic injury,
Ketoconazole inhibits hormone synthesis and can lower concentrations of
cortisol, testosterone, and other hormones in animals. Ketoconazole may produce
a lighter hair coat color in some animals. Ketoconazole has been associated with
cataract formation in dogs.
Contraindications and Precautions
 Do not administer to pregnant animals. At high doses in laboratory animals, it has
caused embryotoxicity and fetal abnormalities. Some of these effects on pregnancy
may be because of the inhi bition of estrogen synthesis by ketoconazole.
Drug Interactions
Ketoconazole is a potent inhibitor of hepatic and intestinal cytochrome P450
enzymes and will inhibit metabolism of other drugs (anticonvulsants,
cyclosponine, warfarin, and cisapride).
Instructions for Use
Oral absorption depends on acidity in the stomach. Do not administer with
antisecretory drugs or antacids. Because of endocrine effects, ketoconazole has been
used for short-term treatment of hyperadrenocorticism. However, many experts
believe that ketoconazole is not an effective long-term treatment for canine
Cushing's disease.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor liver enzymes (ALT, ALP) for evidence of toxicity. Ketoconazole will lower
serum cortisol levels.

by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins. The enzyme inhibited by NSAID
is the cyclo-oxygenase enzyme (COX). The COX enzyme exists in two isoforms:
COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is primarily responsible for synthesis of prostaglandins
important for maintaining a healthy GI tract, renal function, platelet function, and
other normal functions. COX-2 is induced and responsible for synthesizing
prostaglandins that are important mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever.
However, it is known that there is some crossover of COX-l and COX-2 effects
in some situations, and COX-2 activity is important for some biological effects.
Ketoprofen is a nonselective inhibitor of COX-l and COX-2. There is weak
evidence of its ability to inhibit lipoxygenase.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Ketoprofen is an NSAID and is used for treatment of moderate pain and
inflammation. It has a half-life in most animals of less than 2 hours, but it has a
duration of action for up to 24 hours. Ketoprofen is not registered in the US for
small animals but has been labeled for dogs and cats in other countnies. It has been
416 Ketoprofen
pue sop un 'asn n-uol og iaiqen Aq pue juaeai ainoe roy uogafun aq ua
cats, it has been shown effective for treating pyrexia. In horses, ketoprofen is used
for musculoskeletal inflammation and pain, abdominal pain, and other inflammatory
conditions. Ketoprofen also has been used in cattle, goats, sheep, and pigs. In cattle,
it has been effective for fever, pain, and inflammation associated with mastitis. It is
registered for use in cattle in Canada but not in the US.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
All NSAIDs share the similar adverse effect of GI toxicity. The most common
side effect is vomiting. GI ulceration is possible in some animals. Ketoprofen has
been administered for 5 consecutive days in dogs without serious adverse effects,
but longer treatment should be avoided. Dogs that received ketoprofen for 30
consecutive days (0.25 mg/kg per day) induced pyloric lesions and fecal occult
blood. In horses, ketoprofen has been less ulcerogenic than phenylbutazone or
flunixin meglumine in one study. Bleeding problems can occur if ketoprofen is
administered before or after surgery.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not administer to animals prone to GI ulcers. Do not administer with other
ulcerogenic drugs such as corticosteroids. Do not use extended-release
formulations of ketoprofen.
Drug Interactions
Do not administer with other NSAIDs or with corticosteroids. Corticosteroids
have been shown to exacerbate the GI adverse effects. Some NSAIDs may
interfere with the action of diuretic drugs and angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE) inhibitors.
Instructions for Use
Although not approved in the US, ketoprofen is approved for small animals in other
countries. Doses listed are based on approved use in those countries. It is available as
an OTC drug for humans in the US. In the US if it is used in small animals, either the
large animal injectable fomulation or the human oral OTC tablets are used.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor patient for signs of GI intoxication (vomiting and diarrhea). Monitor renal
function during chronic treatment.
Formulations
Ketoprofen is available in 12.5-mg tablets (OTC); 25, 50, and 75 mg (human
preparation); and 100-mg/mL injection for horses. It is available in 10 mg/mL
outside the US.
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature.
Ketoprofen is insoluble in water, but it is soluble in ethanol. Stability of oral
compounded formulations has not been evaluated.

Lactated Ringer's Solution
Trade and Other Names: LRS
Functional Classification: Fluid replacement
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Lactated Ringer's solution is a fluid solution for replacement intended for
intravenous administration. Lactated Ringer's solution contains a balanced
combination of electrolytes and an alkalinizing buffer. This solution contains
28 mEq/L of lactate.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Lactated Ringer's solution is indicated as a replacement or maintenance fluid. It also
is used as a vehicle to deliver intravenous medications via constant rate infusion
(CRI). It has been admimistered SQ, intraosseous {in bone medullary cavity), and
intraperitoneal (IP) in animals when intravenous access is not possible. It contains
lactate, a metabolizable base, but will not correct acidosis as quickly as bicarbonate.
Severely acidemic animals may already have high lactate serum levels.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
No significant adverse effects.
Contraindications and Precautions
Administer intravenous fluids only in patients monitored carefully.
Drug Interactions
Lactated Ringer's solution has a pH of 6-7.5. Do not add medications to this
solution if they are unstable at this pH. Lactated Ringer's contains calcium. Do
not add drugs to this solution that may bind (chelate) to calcium.
Instructions for Use

Lactulose
lak'tyoo-lose
Trade and Other Names: Chronulac and generic brands
Functional Classification: Laxative
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Laxative. Lactulose is a disaccharide sugar containing one molecule of fructose and
one molecule of galactose. Lactulose produces a laxative effect by osmotic effect in
the colon. It is a nonabsorbed sugar and retains water in the intestine after oral
administration via an osmotic effect. Lactulose also will decrease the pH of the
intestinal lumen.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Lactulose is administered orally for treatment of hyperammonemia (hepatic
encephalopathy) because it decreases blood ammonia concentrations via lowering
the pH of the colon; thus ammonia in the colon is not as readily absorbed.
Lactulose also is administered orally to produce a laxative effect for treatment of
constipation.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Excessive use may cause fluid and electrolyte loss.
Contraindications and Precautions
Use lactulose with caution in animals with diabetes because it contains lactose
and galactose.
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions are reported for animals

Leflunomide
le-FLOO-noe-mide, or leh-FLEW-nah-mide
Trade and Other Names: Arava and genenic
Functional Classification: Immunosuppressive drug
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Leflunomide is an isoxazole immunosuppressive drug. Lefunomide is not active as
the parent drug, but it is converted to an active metabolite A77 1726 (also known
as Ml and Teriflunomide), which inhibits T-cell and B-cell proliferation and is
pyrimidine via inhibition of the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. This enzyme
is important for the de novo pyrimidine synthesis, which is critical for function of
activated and stimulated lymphocytes. It also may produce anti-inflammatory effects
by inhibiting proinflammatory cytokines.
After oral absorption, the plasma levels of leflunomide are low or undetectable.
Therapeutic effects are produced from the metabolite A77 1726 (Ml) for the
422 Leflunomide
focus on the metabolite concentrations. In people, the metabolite Ml has a very
 s  u ss  u ia si z e go  
was only 2l hours, and the peak concentrations were much lower than in people.
In people the long half-life requires several days to accumulate to steady-state levels
and to decline from a peak level. Loading doses are often administered in people.
However, because of the shorter half-life, loading doses are not needed in dogs and
steady-state concentrations will be attained in approximately 5 days.
Indications and Clinical Uses
This drug is used in people primarily for rheumatoid arthritis. In dogs it has been
used for a variety of immune-mediated diseases as a substitute for other drugs such
as azathioprine or mycophenolate. These diseases include myasthenia gravis, Evan's
syndrome, immune-mediated hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, and
polymyositis/polyarthritis. Efficacy has not been studied in controlled clinical studies
but are reported anecdotal observations.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
diarrhea. Mild anemia and lethargy also have been observed. Although rare,
leukopenia is possible and periodic CBC to monitor patients is recommended.
Contraindications and Precautions
 Do not administer to pregnant animals. This drug can be toxic to a developing
fetus.
Drug Interactions
No interactions are reported.
Instructions for Use
Leflunomide is used most often in dogs for immunosuppresive treatment when
and a substitute is considered. The dosing protocols used currently are denived from
extrapolation and some anecdotal reports. Most veterinarians start with 4 mg/kg per
 suggest that the dose of 4 mg/kg per day may not produce drug levels that are
be consideration for higher doses.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor CBC and platelet counts in treated animals. Anemia has been reported as
a consequence of treatment. If blood monitoring is pursued, plasma samples may
be collected and measured for A77 1726 (the active metabolite). This metabolite
is stable in serum for up to 5 months under refrigerated conditions. Drug
concentrations at l2 hours (trough) are considered effective if greater than
20 mcg/mL.
Formulations
Available in 5-, 10-, and 20-mg tablets.
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature.

Levamisole Hydrochloride
leh-vam'ih-sole hye-droe-klor'ide
Trade and Other Names: Levasole, Ripercol, Tramisol, and Ergamisol
Functional Classification: Antiparasitic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Levamisole is an antiparasitic drug of the imidazothiazole class. It eliminates a
vaniety of parasites via neuromuscular toxicity. Levamisole has an immunorestorative
effect in animals, but the mechanism of action on the immune system is unknown.
It may activate and stimulate proliferation of T-cells; augment monocyte activation;
and stimulate macrophages, including phagocytosis and chemotaxis. It may increase
neutrophil mobility. However, it is not cytotoxic to neutrophils or immune cells.
Indications and Clinical Uses
In cattle and sheep, it is used to treat a variety of nematodes, including stomach
worms (Haemonchus, Trichostrongylus, and Ostertagia species),intestinal worms
(Trichostrongylus, Cooperin, Nematodirus, Bunostomnm, Oesophagostomnm, and
Chabertin species), and lungworms ( Dictyocanlns species). In pigs it is used to
treat nematodes such as large roundworms (Ascaris saum), nodular worms
(Oesophagostomum species), intestinal thread worms (Strongyloides ransomi), and
lungworms (Metastrongyius species). Levamisole has been used for treatment of
endoparasites in dogs and as a microflaricide. Macrocyclic lactones (e.g., milbemycin
oxime or ivermectin) are considered a preferred heartworm microfiliaricide. In
 people, levamisole is used as an immunostimulant to aid in treatment of colorectal
carcinoma and malignant melanoma. In animals, levamisole also is used as an
immunostimulant, but reports of efficacy are lacking.
Levamisole Hydrochloride425
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Levamisole may produce cholinergic toxicity. It has produced vomiting in some
dogs. The injectable fomulation has caused some swelling at the site of injection.
In humans, when used as an immunostimulant, it has caused stomatitis,
agranulocytosis, and thrombocytopenia.
Contraindications and Precautions
Use cautiously in animals with high heartworm microflaria burdens. Reactions
are possible from heavy kill rate of microfilaria. There are no adverse reactions on
fertility and no effects on pregnancy. In rats and rabbits there was no evidence of
teratogenicity or embryotoxicity at doses of l80 mg/kg. Levamisole is abused in
additional CNS stimulation, or is added as a marker compound. When used in
this fom in people, it has produced agranulocytosis in some individuals.
Levamisole may potentially be converted to Aminorex, a CNS stimulants in
horses, with amphetamine properties, which may affect performance.
Drug Interactions
Do not use with pyrantel because they share the same mechanism of toxicity.
Instructions for Use
In heartworm-positive dogs, it may sterilize female adult heartworms. Levanmisole
has also been used as an immunostimulant; however, clinical reports of its effcacy
are not available. Because of the possibility of contamination at the injection site,
use a clean needle with each animal and clean the injection site.

Levothyroxine Sodium
lee-voe-thye-roks'een soe'dee-um
Trade and Other Names: T4, L-thyroxine, Soloxine, Thyro-Tabs, Synthroid,
ThyroMed. Leventa and equine powders include Equisyn-T4, Levo-Powder,
Thyroid Powder, and Thyro-L
Functional Classification: Hormone
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Thyroid hormone. Levothyroxine is used as replacement therapy for treating patients
with hypothyroidism. Levothyroxine is T4, which is converted in most patients to
the active T3. Requirements and pharmacokinetics vary among animals and doses
are adjusted on the basis of thyroid monitoring. Levothyroxine has a half-life of
approximately 20 hours in dogs.
Indications and Clinical Uses
 Levothyroxine is used for replacerment therapy in animals with thyroid hormone
deficiency (hypothyroidism). It has been used in many species, including dogs, cats,
and horses. Although it has been suggested for use in treating dogs with von
Willebrand's disease, clinical studies failed to show an effect on clotting factors,
bleeding times, or von Willebrand's factor (vWf) from levothyroxine treatment
(0.04mg/kg).
Intravenous levothyroxine sodium may be used in dogs for acute treatment of
hypothyroid dogs with myxedema coma (4-5 mcg/kg IV).
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
 High doses may produce thyrotoxicosis, but is uncommon. Potential adverse
effects from IV treatment include arrhythmias or pneumonia
Contraindications and Precautions
No specific contraindications are reported for small animals. When switching
from one brand to another, it is advised to follow up by testing to ensure that
brands are therapeutically equivalent.
Drug Interactions
Patients receiving corticosteroids may have decreased ability to convert T4 to the
active T3. The following drugs may lower thyroid concentrations when
administered to otherwise healthy animals: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs), sulfonamides, and phenobarbital, although results in some dogs may
administration of estrogens increases thyroid binding globulin and may decrease
the active form of thyroid hormone (T4) in patients receiving thyroid
supplementation. Monitor T4 levels in these patients and increase dose of

is only 37% (average). When using the liquid formulation (Leventa), use the
for tablets in dogs (22 mcg/kg ql2) may not be high enough for some dogs, and
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor serum T4 concentrations to guide therapy. Normal thyroxine (T4) baseline
levels are 20-55 nmol/L (1.5 to 4.3 mcg/dL). Thyrotropin-releasing hormone
(TRH) injection should result in at least l.5-fold increase in T4. To monitor
postpill adequacy of therapy, some feel that the most valuable sample to collect is
immediately prior to the next scheduled dose (trough level). Alternatively, some
clinicians take a peak concentration by collecting a blood sample 4-6 hours after
administering the pill, and the T4 should be between 30 and 60 nmol/L (2.3-
4.6 mcg/dL). If administering the oral liquid, the peak concentration occurs at
2-2.5 hours. In horses, postpill peak occurs at l-2 hours.
Formulations
Levothyroxine is available in a range of sizes from 0.025- to 0.8-mg tablets (in
0.1-mg increments), 0.1 to 0.8-mg chewable tablets, 1.0-mg/mL oral solution for
dogs, and l g per 453.6 of oral powder (l gram per pound) used for horses.
Stability and Storage
Levothyroxine is inherently unstable and can be markedly affected by heat, light,
and humidity. Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room
temperature. Thyroxine is only slightly soluble in water or ethanol. It is more
soluble at pH <2 or >8. It has been unstable in some compounded formulations.
However, it may be added to food products if administered immediately. Powder
may be mixed with water and added to horse's grain every day. When it was mixed
with ethanol followed by mixing with a syrup, it was stable for 15 days at room
temperature and 47 days reffigerated. However, other compounded preparations
have been stable for only 15 days (refigerated) or ll days (room temperature).
Therefore, use of compounded formulations should probably be limited to a storage
time of 10-15 days.
The oral solution (Leventa) has an l8-month shelf-life when stored refrigerated,
but once opened it can be stored for 2 months at room temperature, protected from
light, and for 6 months reffigerated.

No regulatory information is available for animals intended for food. Because of low
risk of residues, no withdrawal times are suggested.
Lidocaine Hydrochloride
lye'doe-kane hye-droe-klor'ide
Trade and Other Names: Xylocaine and generic brands
Functional Classification: Local anesthetic, antiarrhythmic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Local anesthetic. Lidocaine inhibits nerve conduction via sodium channel blockade
Class-l antiarrhythmic. Decreases Phase O depolarization without affecting
conduction. After systemic administration lidocaine is metabolized to
monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX), which also has antiarrhythmic properties.
Lidocaine also has analgesic properties after systemic administration. During.
intravenous infusion, it may decrease pain response. In horses, infusions of lidocaine
have decreased postoperative ileus either through a direct effect, via suppression
of painful stimuli, or through anti-inflammatory effects on neutrophils.
Pharmacokinetics in dogs and cats are similar; however, cats have increased
sensitivity to the cardiac effects. In horses, half-life ranges from 40 min to 80 min,
with a high, but variable, clearance rate.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Lidocaine is used commonly as a local anesthetic and for acute treatment of
ventricular arrhythmias. Lidocaine should be used cautiously for treating
supraventricular arrhythmias because it may increase cardiac conduction. Lidocaine
also is used for pain management. It has been administered as a constant rate
infusion (CRI) in animals, especially in postsurgical patients. Lidocaine has been
combined with other analgesics, which may be synergistic and allow lower doses
of each individual component. One example of a combination is MLK, which is
morphine (or fentanyl), lidocaine, and ketamine. Lidocaine has been used, on a
limited basis, to treat seizures that are refractory to other drugs. In horses, studies
have confirmed that a lidocaine CRI may help to restore intestinal motility and is
used to treat intestinal ileus.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
High doses cause CNS effects (tremors, twitches, and seizures) and vomiting
but risk of lidocaine-induced seizures is low. Lidocaine can produce cardiac
arrhythmias, but it has greater effect on abnormal cardiac tissue than normal
tissue. Intravenous doses of lidocaine in cats have resulted in death. In cats
under anesthesia, lidocaine administration has caused decreased cardiac output,
cardiovascular depression, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues. In cats,
idocaine has also produced methemoglobinemia and hemolysis. Intravenous and
432Lidocaine Hydrochloride
CRIs in horses have caused muscle fasciculations, rapid eye blinking, anxiety,
ataxia, weakness, and seizures.
Contraindications and Precautions
Cats are more susceptible to adverse effects, and lower doses should be used for
cats. Absorption from lidocaine patches in cats is only 6.3% and not expected to
present a problem. In animals with decreased blood flow to liver (e.g., animals
Drug Interactions
Lidocaine hydrochloride is maintained as an acidic solution for solubility.
Although short-term mixing with alkaline solutions may not interfere with
stability (i.e., immediately prior to administration), storage in alkalinizing
solutions can cause precipitation. If mixed with alkalinizing solutions, it should
be administered promptly.
Instructions for Use
When used for local infiltration, many fommulations contain epinephrine to prolong
activity at the injection site. Avoid using formulations that contain epinephrine in
patients with cardiac arrhythmias. Note that human formulations may contain
epinephrine, but no veterinary formulations contain epinephrine. To increase pH,
peed onset of action, and decrease pain from injection, one may add l mEq sodium
bicarbonate to l0 mL lidocaine (use immediately after mixing). To prepare solutions
for infusion in horses, mix 10 g of 2% idocaine in 3 L of LRS (0.33% solution).
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor for signs of neurotoxicity (e.g., depression, muscle twitching, and seizures).
Monitor ECG during treatment for cardiac rate and rhythm in treated animals.
Formulations
Lidocaine is available in 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-mg/mL injection.
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature.

Lincomycin Hydrochloride, Lincomycin
Hydrochloride Monohydrate
lin-koe-mye'sin hye-droe-kloride, lin-koe-mye'sin hye-droe-klor'ide mono-hye'drate
Trade and Other Names: Lincocin and Lincomix
Functional Classification: Antibacterial
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Lincosamide antibiotic. Lincomycin is similar in mechanism to clindamycin.
Mechanism of action is also similar to macrolides, such as erythromycin, and there
may be cross resistance among these drugs. Like the other related drugs, the site of
action is the 50S ribosomal subunit. By inhibiting this ribosome, it decreases protein
synthesis. In most bacteria it is bacteriostatic. The spectrum includes primarily
gram-positive bacteria and atypical bacteria such as Mycoplasmo.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Lincomycin has a gram-positive spectrum and has limited use for other infections. In
small animals it is used for pyoderma and other soft tissue infections caused by
susceptible gram-positive bacteria. It is also active against Mycoplasmn, Erysipelothrix,
infections caused by Mycoplasma. Although it has been injected IM in cattle and
sheep for treatment of septic arthritis, laryngeal abscesses, and mastitis, this
treatment is not currently recommended. Compared to lincomycin, clindamycin has
better activity against anaerobic bactena.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects are uncommon. Lincomycin has caused vomiting and diarrhea in
animals. Severe, and even fatal, enteritis can be caused from oral administration
to ruminants.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not administer orally to rodents, horses, ruminants, or rabbits. Oral
administration to ruminants and horses can cause severe enteritis.
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions reported for animals.
Instructions for Use
Action of lincomycin and clindamycin are similar enough that clindamycin can be
substituted for lincomycin.

Linezolid
lih-neh-zoe'lide
Trade and Other Names: Zyvox and Zyvoxam (Canada)
Functional Classification: Antibacterial
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Linezolid is an antibiotic in the oxazolidinone class (synthetic drugs). It is
bacteriostatic with a unique mechanism of action. It inhibits protein synthesis by
binding to a site on the bacterial 23S ribosomal RNA of the 50S subunit. This
prevents formation of the 7oS ribosomal unit; therefore protein synthesis is
inhibited. Linezolid has good penetration into cells and extracellular fluid. Urine
pharmacokinetics are similar to humans. The oral absorption is almost loo%, and
Linezolid 435
the half-life is slightly faster than humans. Linezolid does not undergo hepatic P450
metabolism, and one third of the total clearance relies on the kidneys.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Linezolid is active against streptococci and staphylococci and is indicated for
treatment of infections that have become resistant to other drugs, particularly when
there is resistance to the beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillins, ampicillin derivatives,
and cephalosporins). It is not indicated for gram-negative infections. Linezolid is
indicated for treatment of methicillin-resistant and oxacillin-resistant strains of
Sta phylococcus (e.g., MRSA and MRSP) and drug-resistant Enterococcus spp. Because
of the high cost of linezolid, it is not used for routine infections.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects include diarrhea and nausea. Rarely, anemia and leukopenia have
teen observed in people. Because of limited use in animals, adverse effects have
not been reported.
Contraindications and Precautions
No contraindications reported.
Drug Interactions
Linezolid is a Type-A monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). Possible
interactions occur with serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as fluoxetine and
selegiline to produce serotonin syndrome. Interactions are also possible if
administered with adrenergic drugs such as phenylpropanolamine. However, this
effect has not been reported for animals. Linezolid is not expected to affect
with other drugs in IV line. If administered with other drugs IV, flush out
administration line first.
Instructions for Use
Linezolid is reserved for infections that are resistant to other drugs, such as
Enterococcus, Streptococcus, or Staphylococcus infections.

Liothyronine Sodium
lye-oh-thye'roe-neen soe^dee-um
Trade and Other Names: Cytomel
Functional Classification: Hormone
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Thyroid supplement. Liothyronine is equivalent to T3. T3 is more active than T4,
but ordinarily T4 is converted in animals to the active form of T3.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Liothyronine is used for similar indications as levothyroxine (T4), except that in this
instance, the active T3 hormone is administered. It may be indicated in cases in
which there is failure to convert T4 to the active T3 hormone. In most cases, it is
preferred to administer levothyroxine instead of liothyronine.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects have not been reported.
Contraindications and Precautions
No contraindications reported.
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions reported for animals.
Instructions for Use
Doses of liothyronine should be adjusted on the basis of monitoring T3
concentrations in patients. It is rarely necessary to administer T3 alone for treatment
of hypothyroidism. In most patients drugs that contain T4 should be used (e.g-
levothyroxine). Liothyronine has been used as a diagnostic test for cats.
 Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor serum T3 concentrations. Used for T3 suppressing test in cats.
Formulations
Liothyronine is available in 5-, 25-, 50-, and 60-mcg tablets.

Lisinopril
lye-sin'oh-pril
Trade and Other Names: Prinivil and Zestril
 Functional Classification: Vasodilator, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
inhibitor
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Like other ACE inhibitors, lisinopril inhibits conversion of angiotensin I to
angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor and will also stimulate
sympathetic stimulation, renal hypertension, and synthesis of aldosterone. The ability
of aldosterone to cause sodium and water retention contributes to congestion
Lisinopril, like other ACE inhibitors, will cause vasodilation and decrease
aldosterone-induced congestion. Lisinopril also contributes to vasodilation by
increasing concentrations of some vasodilating kinins and prostaglandins. Like other
ACE inhibitors, lisinopril can reduce renal hypertension and improve renal perfusion,
decrease glomerular pressure, and lead to improvement in some patients with renal
disease.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Lisinopril, like other ACE inhibitors, is used to treat hypertension and congestive
heart failure (CHF). Enalapril has been used more often in animals. Other uses may
include primary hypertension. Lisinopril also may be used to treat some forms of
established.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Like other ACE inhibitors, it may cause azotemia in some patients. Carefully
Contraindications and Precautions
Discontinue ACE inhibitors in pregnant animals; they cross the placenta and have
caused fetal malformations and death of the fetus.
438  Lithium Carbonate
Drug Interactions
Use cautiously with other hypotensive drugs and diuretics. Nonsteroidal anti-

Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Lithium stimulates granulopoiesis and elevates neutrophil pool in animals. It also
affects the CNS because it affects the balance of CNS neurotransmitters.
Indications and Clinical Uses
 In people lithium is used for treatment of depression. It has not been used for this
 purpose in animals. It has also been used experimentally to increase neutrophil
counts following cancer therapy and to prevent cytotoxicity caused from anticancer
drugs.

Lomustine
loe-mus'teen
Trade and Other Names: CeeNu and CCNU
Functional Classification: Anticancer agent
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Anticancer agent. It is one of two nitrosoureas used: lomustine (l-[2-chloroethyl]-3-
cyclohexyl-l-chloroethylnitrosourea), known by the abbreviation of CCNU, and
cammustine (l ,3-bis-2-chloroethyl-l-nitrosourea), known by the abbreviation BCNU.
These drugs, in addition to being lipid soluble, are alkylating agents. Both of the
nitrosoureas are metabolized spontaneously to alkylating and carbamyolating
compounds. The binding occurs preferentially at the O-6 of guanine. Bifinctional
interstrand cross-links are responsible for the cytotoxicity of nitrosoureas. Oral
440 Lomustine
absorption and high membrane penetration are attributed to high lipophilicity.
Because oral absorption is high, lomustine can be administered effectively as tablets.
After absorption, lomustine is metabolized to antitumor metabolites. Both the
parent drug and the metabolites are lipid soluble. The CNS penetration of lomustine
has been determined from the plasma/cerebrospinal fuid (CSF) ratio, which is l:3.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Lomustine (CCNU) is used to treat tumors of the CNS, mast cell tumors, and
ymphoma in dogs and cats. It has occasionally been used to treat other forms of
cancer. Lomustine has been used more often than carmustine.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Bone marrow effects are the most serious. In people, lomustine has a delayed
nadir of bone marrow toxicity, which is as long as 4-6 weeks with slow recovery,
but in dogs the nadir of bone marrow effects generally is seen 6-7 days after
dosing. Maximum tolerated dose in dogs is 90 mg/m?. At higher doses
sy osle eruadoiaoquau 'panodan uasq sey uoisssiddnsoaau (u/suu ool)
been reported from lomustine administration as a cumulative effect.
In cats, neutropenia is the most dose-limiting effect of treatment. Cats
resemble people in that bone marrow nadir of toxicity occurs at 3-4 weeks.
Nitrosoureas also can be toxic to the rapidly dividing cells of mucosa. In
people, nitrosoureas also have caused pulmonary fibrosis and hepatotoxicity.
Hepatotoxicity may be a delayed reaction. The hepatic damage, when observed
in dogs, has been irreversible. In people, carmustine (BCNU) has been associated
with a higher rate of hepatic injury than lomustine.
Contraindications and Precautions
Consider risks to bone marrow with use in small animals.
Drug Interactions
Use with caution with any drugs that may cause bone marrow suppression.
Instructions for Use
The nitrosourea drugs are used to treat CNS tumors and other forms of cancer.
Protocols used in small animals are different from those given to people, which are
if possible.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor CBC and liver enzymes in treated patients.

Loperamide Hydrochloride
loe-pare'ah-mide hye-droe-klorride
Trade and Other Names: Imodium and generic brands
Functional Classification: Analgesic, opioid
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Opiate agonist. Like other opiates, loperamide acts on the mu-opiate receptors
of the GI tract. It decreases propulsive intestinal contractions and increases
segmentation (an overall constipating effect). It also increases the tone of GI
sphincters. In addition to affecting motility, opiates have an antisecretory effect and
stimulate absorption of fluid, electrolytes, and glucose. Their effects on secretory
diarrhea are probably related to inhibition of calcium influx and decreased
calmodulin activity. Action of loperamide is limited to the intestine. CNS effects do
not occur because it does not cross the blood-brain barnier.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Loperamide is used for symptomatic treatment of acute nonspecific diarrhea. It has
been administered orally to dogs and cats. Long-term use is discouraged because it
may lead to constipation. It has been administered to large animals, but this is not
recommended.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
have a mutation in the multidrug resistance (MDR) gene, they may lack
P-glycoprotein in the blood-brain barrier. In these susceptible animals,
loperamide will cross the blood-brain barnier and cause profound sedation. Such
cases may be reversed with naloxone. Dogs most susceptible include Collie
breeds, Australian shepherds, Old English sheepdogs, Longhaired Whippets, and
Shetland sheepdogs.
Contraindications and Precautions
Small dogs and Collie-type dogs may be at higher risk of adverse effects.
Drug Interactions
Do not administer with drugs that may act as MDRl (p-glycoprotein)
membrane inhibitors, such as ketoconazole. (Other inhibitors are listed in
Appendix.) These inhibitors may increase blood-brain bamier penetration and
cause depression.

half-life of 0.9 hours, with systemic clearance less than half that of diazepam. Oral
absorption is 60%. Therefore, the oral formulation may be suitable in dogs for some
conditions.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Lorazepam, as a benzodiazepine, may be considered for anxiety disorders in animals,
but it has not been used as commonly as other drugs such as diazepam. Lorazepam
also is effective for treating seizures, but it is not used as often in animals as other
anticonvulsants. In controlled studies it has been equally as effective as diazepam
in dogs.

idiosyncratic liver injury in cats, but this is unlikely for lorazepam.
Drug Interactions
 Use cautiously with other drugs that may cause sedation. Do not mix with
buprenorphine.
Instructions for Use
Doses based on empiricism. There have been no clinical trials in veterinary medicine,
although it is expected to produce effects similar to other benzodiazepines. For
intravenous use, dilute 50/50 with 0.9% saline or 5% dextrose prior to use.

Schedule IV controlled drug
RCI Classification: 2
Losartan
loe-zar'tan
Trade and Other Names: Cozaar
Functional Classification: Vasodilator
444  Losartan
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Vasodilator, Angioitensin II receptor blocker (ARB). It has high affnity and
selectivity for the ATl receptor. The action is similar to that of ACE inhibitors,
except that it directly blocks the receptor, rather than inhibits synthesis of
angiotensin II. ARBs have the advantage of being less likely to induce
hyperkalemia and are more easily tolerated in people. Losartan and other ARBs
have been used in people who cannot tolerate angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE) inhibitors. In people it is metabolized to the active carboxylic acid
metabolite, which is 10-40 times more potent than the parent drug and believed to
be responsible for most clinical effects. The metabolite is not produced in effective
levels in dogs.
Indications and Clinical Uses
In dogs, it is reported that they do not convert losartan to the active metabolite,
and therefore it has little activity in dogs. However, a related drug, irbesartan
(30 mg/kg ql2h), has been shown to block angiotensin II receptors.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
No adverse reactions have been reported in animals. In people, hypotension may
occur.
Contraindications and Precautions
No specific contraindications have been reported for animals. Do not use in
pregnant animals.
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions are reported for animals.
Instructions for Use
In dogs, losartan is not converted to the active metabolite. Therefore it has little
bioactivity (J Pharmacol Exp Ther, 268:1199-1205,1999). It is suggested instead to
consider irbesartan at a dose of 30 mg/kg ql2h PO.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor blood pressure in treated animals.
Formulations
Losartan is available in 25- and 50-mg tablets.
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature.
 Stability of compounded formulations has not been evaluated.

Lufenuron  445
Regulatory Information
Do not administer to animals intended for food.
RCI Classification: 3
Lufenuron
loo-fen'yoo-ra.hn
Trade and Other Names: Program
Functional Classification: Antiparasitic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antiparasitic. Lufenuron is a benzoylurea insecticide. This class of insecticides was
been used for prevention of flea infections in dogs and cats because it inhibits chitin
synthesis. For this use it has been given to dogs at a dose of l0 mg/kg every 30
days and to cats at a dose of 30 mg/kg every 30 days. It may also have some
inhibition on fungal cell membranes because it inhibits the cell wall of fungi, which
contain chitin, and other complex polysaccharides. Because of this property on
fungal cell membranes there has been interest in using lufenuron to treat
dermatophytes in small animals. However, proven efficacy has been controversial.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Lufenuron is used to control flea infestations by preventing hatching of eggs. It has
been used as part of flea control, often with other drugs that kill adult fleas.
Lufenuron has been combined with milbemycin in formulations for small animals,
and additional details may be found in the section on milbemycin. There are clinical
reports of the use of lufenuron for treating dermatophyte infections in small
animals—particularly cats—at high doses of 80-100 mg/kg orally. However,
endorsement of this use has diminished and dermatologists have disputed the
efficacy and have observed a high incidence of recurrence. In horses lufenuron was
not absorbed orally and is not effective for treating fungal infections. It does not
have any in vitro effect onAspergillnsfumigatus or Coccidioides immitis.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Refer to the section on lufenuron or milbemycin for details.
Contraindications and Precautions
No contraindications are reported for animals. Some animals may be sensitive to
milbenycin, and additional details are found in that section.
Drug Interactions
 No drug interactions reported for animals, except those that may pertain to
milbemycin.
Instructions for Use
 Lufenuron is a highly lipophilic drug and is absorbed best with a meal. If cats have
free access to their food, withhold their food until such time that a meal will be
consumed readily before administering the lufenuron oral dose. Lufenuron may
control flea development with administration once every 30 days in animals.

Mannitol
man'ih-tole
Trade and other names: Osmitrol
Functional classification: Diuretic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Hyperosmotic diuretic. Mannitol occurs naturally as a sugar in fruits and vegetables.
As an osmotic diuretic, mannitol is freely filtered by the glomerulus, but it is not
reabsorbed by the renal tubule. Therefore it increases osmolality of the urine.
The osmotic effect inhibits reabsorption of fluid from the renal tubules, and this
produces a natriuretic effect and strong diuresis. Reabsorption of sodium chloride
Mannitol 453
and solutes also is inhibited. Mannitol, compared to other diuretic drugs, produces a
more profound diuretic effect, which can potentially cause excessive fluid loss in a
 patient. After intravenous administration, mannitol increases the plasma osmolality,
which draws fluid from tissues to plasma, which is helpful for treating tissue
edema (e.g., cerebral edema). It reduces intracranial pressure. It is also used as an
antiglaucoma agent because it lowers intraocular pressure when administered IV.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Mannitol is administered IV for treatment of cerebral edema, acute glaucoma, and
conditions associated with tissue edema. Mannitol also has been used to promote
       
failure.

Marbofloxacin
mar-boe-floks'ah-sin
Trade and other names: Zeniquin and Marbocyl (European name)
Functional classification: Antibactenial
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Fuoroquinolone antimicrobial. Marbofloxacin acts via inhibition of DNA gyrase in
bacteria to inhibit DNA and RNA synthesis. Marbofloxacin is a bactericidal with a
broad spectnum of activity. Sensitive bacteria include Staphylococcns, Escherichin coli,
Protens, Klebsiella, and Pastenrella.Psendomonas aeruginosa is moderately sensitive
but requires higher concentrations. Some methicillin-resistant Staphylococcns also
may be resistant to fluoroquinolones. Marbofloxacin has poor activity against
streptococci and anaerobic bacteria.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Marbofloxacin, like other fluoroquinolones, is used to treat susceptible bacteria in a
variety of species. Marbofloxacin is registered for use in dogs and cats. Infections
treated with marbofloxacin include skin and soft tissue infections, bone infections,
UTIs, pneumonia, and infections caused by intracellular organisms. Marbofloxacin
has been effective for some bloodborne pathogens such as Mycoplasmn haemofelis, in
cats at a dose of 2.75 mg/kg q24h PO for 14 days. Marbofloxacin also has been
used in horses to treat infections caused by susceptible bactenia. In dogs the half-life
is 7-9 hours, but it has been longer in some studies. In horses the half-life has varied
from 4.7 to 7.6 hours, depending on the study. Volume of distribution in these
 species is 1.2 to 2 L/kg. Oral absorption is close to 100% in small animals and
approximately 60% in horses.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
High concentrations may cause CNS toxicity. Like other fluoroquinolones, it
may cause some nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea at high doses. When administered
 IV to anesthetized patients, it did not alter cardiovascular parameters. All of the
fluoroquinolones may cause arthropathy in young animals. Dogs are most
sensitive at 4-28 weeks of age. Large, rapidly growing dogs are the most
susceptible. Marbofloxacin at a dose of twice the upper limit caused articular
damage in dogs that were 4-5 months old. In cats 8 months old at doses of 17
and 28 mg/kg for 42 days articular, cartilage injury was observed. Blindness in
cats has been reported from some quinolones such as enrofloxacin and nalidixic
acid. There are no known clinical reports of this reaction with marbofloxacin, and
toxicity studies by the manufacturer showed that it did not cause ocular lesions
or vision problems in cats. At doses of 17 mg/kg and 28 mg/kg (three times
Marbofloxacin 455
and five times the upper limit of dosing) it did not produce ocular changes.
Marbofloxacin has been administered to horses orally without producing adverse
effects in the GI tract.
Contraindications and Precautions
Avoid use in young animals because of risk of cartilage injury. Use cautiously in
animals that may be prone to seizures.
Drug Interactions
Fluoroquinolones may increase concentrations of theophylline if used
concurrently. Coadministration with divalent and tnivalent cations, such as
products containing aluminum (e.g., sucralfate), iron, and calcium, may decrease
absorption. Do not mix in solutions or in vials with aluminum, calcium, iron, or
zinc because chelation may occur. Marbofloxacin may be administered with other
antibiotics and anesthetic agents without evidence of drug interaction
Instructions for Use
At the low range of the approved label dose, marbofloxacin is active against most
susceptible bacteria. Within the approved dose range, higher doses are needed for
organisms with higher minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values. Doses
published for European use are lower than US approved doses, but there is no

456  Maropitant citrate
Regulatory Information
Marbofloxacin is prohibited from use in animals intended for food. There are no
withdrawal times established because it should not be administered to animals that
produce food.
Maropitant citrate
mar-op'-i-tent
Trade and other names: Cerenia
Functional classification: Antiemetic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
 Maropitant is an antiemetic from the same group as the human drug aprepitant
(Emend). These drugs act as an antiemetic by blocking the neurokinin-l (NK,)
receptor (also known as Substance P). It has less affinity for other neurokinin
and behavioral responses, at doses used to control vomiting there were no
adverse effects associated with blockade of other receptors. Neurokinin-l is a
neurotransmitter to simulate vomiting from the emetic center. Maropitant can
inhibit vomiting that is stimulated from both central and peripheral sources
mediated by other neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, histamine, dopamine, and
srotonin. In dogs, the half-life was 4 to 8 hours, depending on the dose. Dose-
 dependent pharmacokinetics occur with the clearance decreasing and half-life
increasing with doses above 2 mg/kg. Because of nonlinear pharmacokinetics,
accumulation is possible with repeated dosing. Oral absorption is 24% at 2 mg/kg
and 37% at 8 mg/kg in dogs. Pharmacokinetics are not affected by feeding. In cats
the clearance is much lower than in dogs, and the half-life is longer than in dogs at
13-17 hours. In cats, it has nearly complete SQ absorption and 50% oral absorption.
Indications and Clinical Uses
 Maropitant is approved for use as an antiemetic in dogs to inhibit vomiting from
both central and peripheral sources. It has been effective to inhibit vomiting from
chemotherapy, gastrointestinal disease, toxins, renal disease, vestibular stimuli
(motion sickness), and circulating stimuli via the chemoreceptor trigger zone. After
SQ injection it has a rapid onset and a duration of 24 hours. Although not approved
for cats, it has been used safely and effectively in cats to treat vomiting from a
variety of sources, such as motion sickness and stimulation by emetogenic agents,
with a duration of action of 24 hours.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Maropitant may cause slight pain or irritation from SQ injection. It has been
recognized that the pain is caused by alteration of the formulation, which may
occur when the injectable formulation is stored at room temperature. The
cyclodextrin complex of maropitant is preserved at cold temperatures and is more
stable and intact when the formulation is refrigerated. Therefore, the adverse
event associated with a painfil injection can be reduced if injectable maropitant is
Maropitant citrate 457
stored in the refrigerator before use. Safety studies have been conducted with
at 3x and 5x the labeled dose. Adverse effects observed in trials included excess
salivation and muscle tremors. In cats it has been well-tolerated at high doses {of
a factor of 10x) and was safe at 5 mg/kg for 15 consecutive days.
Contraindications and Precautions
There is accumulation after repeated doses and decreased clearance with higher
doses. Therefore, because of accumulation, it should not be administered for
more than 5 consecutive days. Allow a 2-day washout period before instituting
another course of treatment. Take care to identify any underlying disease
whenever possible instead of relying on maropitant to control the clinical signs.
Maropitant effects and pharmacokinetics are not affected by renal disease.
Drug Interactions
Single doses have been administered in an IV line, but precipitation may be
observed if mixed with alkalinizing solutions. Maropitant is an NK, inhibitor.
Other neurokinin receptors are affected by a lesser degree. Because of the unique
mechanism of action, drug interactions have not been identified. Maropitant has
been used safely with other drugs, including anesthetics and anticancer agents.
Maropitant is highly protein bound, but it is not known if there are protein-
binding interactions with other drugs.
Instructions for Use
M
Clinical trials in dogs have outlined the appropriate protocols for use of maropitant.
It has been effective for a wide range of causes of vomiting in dogs. In cats,
although not approved, it has been effective for a variety of causes of vomiting,
including motion sickness and stimulation from emetogenic agents. The effective
dose in cats is l mg/kg regardless of cause.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor for clinical signs and disease that may be a cause for the vomiting. Other

Regulatory Information
No regulatory information is available. Because of low risk of residues, no
withdrawal times are suggested.
Mebendazole
meh-ben'dah-zole
Trade and other names: Telmintic, Telmin, Vemox (human preparation), and
generic brands
Functional classification: Antiparasitic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Benzimidazole antiparasitic drug. Like other benzimidazoles, mebendazole produces
a degeneration of the parasite microtubule and irreversibly blocks glucose uptake in
parasites. Inhibition of glucose uptake causes depletion of energy stores in the
parasite, eventually resulting in death. However, there is no effect on glucose
metabolism in mammals.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Mebendazole is used in horses for treatment of infections caused by large
M1
and S. vwigaris), small strongyles, and mature and immature (fourth larval stage
pinworms [Oxywris eqwi]). In dogs it has been used for treatment of infections of
roundworms (Toxocara canis),hookworms (Ancylostoma caninum and Uncinarin
stenocephaia), whipworms (Trichnris vnipis),and tapeworms (Taenin pisiformis).

Meclofenamate Sodium, Meclofenamic Acid
mek'loe-fen'am-ate soe-dee'um, mek'loe-fen-am'ik ass'id
Trade and other names: Arquel and Meclofen
Functional classification: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Meclofenamate is also known as meclofenamic acid and is related to tolfenamic acid,
which is approved in some countries for animals. Meclofenamate and other NSAIDs
have produced analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the synthesis of
prostaglandins. The enzyme inhibited by NSAIDs is the cyclo-oxygenase enzyme
(COX). The COX enzyme exists in two isofoms: COX-l and COX-2. COX-1 is
healthy GI tract, renal function, platelet function, and other normal functions.
COX-2 is induced and responsible for synthesizing prostaglandins that are important
mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever. Meclofenamic acid is a balanced
COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Meclofenamate is used in animals for treatment of pain and inflammation.
The most common use has been musculoskeletal inflammation. Use in animals
has diminished because of decreased availability and increased popularity of other
drugs.
462  Medetomidine Hydrochloride
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects have not been reported in animals, but adverse effects common to
other NSAIDs are posible. These side effects are generally GI in nature (e.g-
gastnitis, gastric ulcers).
Contraindications and Precautions
 Do not administer to animals prone to GI ulcers. Do not administer with other
ulcerogenic drugs such as corticosteroids. The original labeling for animals
suggests that duration is limited to 5-7 days.
Drug Interactions
 Like other NSAIDs, ulcerogenic effects are potentiated when administered with
corticosteroids. Meclofenamic acid, like other NSAIDs, may interfere with the
action of diuretics, such as furosemide, and angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE) inhibitors.
Instructions for Use
Most of the experience with meclofenamate has been with horses. Commercial
fomulations are no longer marketed for animals. Administer with food.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor for signs of GI ulceration during use.
Formulations
 Meclofenamate is available in 50- and 100-mg capsules (rarely available commercially
any longer), 10- and 20-mg tablets (formulation for dogs), and granules for horses
(5% meclofenamic acid).

Medetomidine Hydrochloride
meh-deh-toe'mih-deen hye-droe-klorride
Trade and other names: Domitor
Functional classification: Analgesic, Alpha2 agonist
Medetomidine Hydrochloride463
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Alphaz-adrenergic agonist. Alphaz-agonists decrease release of neurotransmitters from
the neuron. Medetomidine is a racemic mixture containing 50% dexmedetomidine
and 50% levomedetomidine. Dexmedetomidine is the active enantiomer of the
mixture (D-isomer); therefore (on a mg/mg basis) dexmetomidine is twice the
potency of medetomidine but with the same pharmacological activity and equivalent
analgesic and sedative effects. The proposed mechanism whereby the alpha-2-
agonists decrease transmission is via binding to presynaptic alphaz-receptors (negative
feedback receptors). The result is decreased sympathetic outflow, analgesia, sedation,
and anesthesia. Other drugs in this class include xylazine, detomidine, and clonidine
Receptor-binding studies indicate that alpha2/alphaj-adrenergic receptor selectivity
for medetomidine was more than 1000-fold greater than xylazine.
Indications and Clinical Uses
 Because of potency and availability, dexmedetomidine has replaced medetomidine for
most indications in small animals. Medetomidine, like other alphaz-agonists, is used as
a sedative, anesthetic adjunct, and analgesic. It has been used to sedate animals for
intradermal skin testing without affecting results. Duration of effect is 0.5-l.5 hours
at the low dose and up to 3 hours for the high dose. Compared to xylazine,
medetomidine has produced better sedation and analgesia than xylazine in dogs.
Many anesthesiologists have recommended combinations of medetomidine and
ketamine, medetomidine and butorphanol, or medetomidine and hydromorphone in
dogs for sedation and short-term procedures. Medetomidine combined with an opiate
(butorphanol or hydromorphone) has produced a longer duration of sedation and
M
more desirable degree of sedation than medetomidine used alone.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
In small animals, vomiting is the most common acute effect. Alpha2-agonists
decrease sympathetic output. Cardiovascular depression may occur. Constant rate
infusion (CRI) of l.5 mcg/kg/hr has caused decreased heart rate and sinus
arrhythmia in dogs. Doses as low as l mcg/kg IV can reduce cardiac output
to less than 40% of resting value. Medetomidine will cause initial bradycardia
anticholinergic drugs (e.g., atropine). If adverse reactions are observed, reverse
with atipamezole. If atipamezole is not available, yohimbine also can reverse
medetomidine.
Contraindications and Precautions
Use cautiously in animals with heart disease. Use may be contraindicated in older
animals with preexisting cardiac disease. Xylazine causes problems in pregnant
animals, and this also should be considered for other alpha2-agonists. Use
cautiously in animals that are pregnant because it may induce labor. In addition,
   s    a s  
Drug Interactions
Do not use with other drugs that may cause cardiac depression. Do not mix in a
vial or syringe with other anesthetics, except as listed under the dosing section.
Reverse with atipamezole at a dose of 25-300 mcg/kg IM. Use with opioid
analgesic drugs will greatly enhance the CNS depression, so consider lowering
doses if administered with opioids.
464   Medetomidine Hydrochloride
Instructions for Use
Medetomidine, dexmedetomidine, and detomidine are more specific for the
alphaz-receptor than xylazine. Dexmedetomidine has twice the potency of
medetomidine. Therefore, these drugs should not be used interchangeably without
sdation, analgesia, and minor surgical procedures. Many veterinarians use doses
that are much less than the doses listed on the label. For example, lower doses are
sometimes used for short-term sedation and analgesia, particularly when combined
with other drugs such as opiates. Reverse with atipamezole at a dose of
25-300 mcg/kg (equal to volume of medetomidine used) IM.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
 Monitor vital signs during anesthesia. Monitor heart rate, blood pressure, and ECG
if possible during anesthesia.
Formulations
Medetomidine is available in a 1.0-mg/mL injection.
Stability and Storage

(0.005-0.015 mg/kg) IV, IM, or SQ. These doses may be increased up to
60 mcg/kg when severe pain is involved. 20 mcg/kg has been used in
combination with butorphanol (0.2 mg/kg), hydromorphone (0.1 mg/kg), or
ketamine for short-term procedures.

Melarsomine Dihydrochloride
mel-ar'soe-meen
Trade and other names: Immiticide
Functional classification: Antiparasitic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Organic arsenical compound. Arsenicals alter glucose uptake and metabolism to
eliminate heartworms. Melarsomine has replaced older arsenicals such as
thiacetarsamide (Caparsolate).
Indications and Clinical Uses
Melarsomine is used for heartworm adulticide therapy. See Instructions for Use for
proper administration. Melarsomine is highly effective for eliminating heartworms
in dogs. Effcacy in cats is only 36%. Usually cats are not treated because it is a
self-limiting disease and only supportive treatment is administered (corticosteroids,
bronchodilators, and antiemetics).
468  Melarsomine Dihydrochloride
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Melarsomine may cause pulmonary thromboembolism 7-20 days after therapy,
anorexia {13% incidence), injection-site reaction (32% incidence of myositis), or
lethargy or depression (l5% incidence). It causes elevations of hepatic enzymes.
High doses (three times the dose) can cause pulmonary inflammation and death. If
high doses are administered, dimercaprol (3 mg/kg IM) may be used as antidote.
To prevent adverse reactions of adulticide therapy, many veterinarians administer
 prednisolone or prednisone at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg ql2h for the frst week and
0.5 mg/kg, q24h for the second week, followed by 0.5 mg/kg every other day for
1 to 2 weeks. There is also evidence that doxycycline (10 or 20 mg/kg per day,
 PO) may decrease pulmonary reactions to melarsomine therapy.
Contraindications and Precautions
Use cautiously in animals with high heartworm burden. Specifically, melarsomine
is contraindicated in dogs with Class 4 (very severe) heartworm disease.
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions are reported. Administration of prednisolone does not affect
efficacy of melarsomine.
Instructions for Use
Dose regimens are based on severity of heartworm disease. Follow product insert
carefully for instructions on proper administration. Also evaluate patient to
determine class of heartworm disease (Class 1l-4) before initiating treatment. Class l
and 2 are least severe. Class 3 is severe and Class 4 is most severe and should not
be treated with adulticide before surgery. In animals with severe burdens, and even
including Class l and 2 patients, some cardiologists recommend using a three dose
protocol. The three dose protocol, which includes a single IM injection of 2.5 mg/
kg to decrease the initial worm burden, then administer two additional doses, 24
hours apart, in 2 or 3 months. Alternatively, there may be benefits for administering
a preventive dose of a macrocyclic lactone, with doxycycline, for 30 days, followed
by the first injection of melarsomine at 60 days, and two more injections of
melarsomine at 90 days. Avoid human exposure by washing hands after handling or
wearing gloves. There should be strict exercise restriction in dogs during adulticide
treatment. More details on the protocol for administration can be found at the
American Heartworm Society's website (http:/ /www.heartwormsociety.org/).
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor heartworm status and microflaria after treatment. Monitor treated patients
carefully for signs of pulmonary thromboembolism.

(human formulation in Canada)
Functional classification: Anti-inflammatory
M
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Meloxicam is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Like other drugs in
this class, meloxicam has analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the
synthesis of prostaglandins. The enzyme inhibited by NSAID is the cyclo-oxygenase
enzyme (COX). The COX enzyme exists in two isofoms: COX-l and COX-2
COX-l is primarily responsible for synthesis of prostaglandins important for
maintaining a healthy GI tract, renal function, platelet function, and other normal
functions. COX-2 is induced and responsible for synthesizing prostaglandins that are
important mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever. However, it is known that there
is some crossover of COX-1 and COX-2 effects in some situations, and COX-2
activity is important for some biological effects. Meloxicam is relatively COX-1
sparing compared to older NSAIDs, but it is not known if the specificity for COX-1
or COX-2 is related to efficacy or safety. Meloxicam has a half-life of 23-24 hours in
dogs, 15 hours in cats, and 8.5 (range 5-14.5) in horses. Meloxicam is highly protein
bound. Oral absorption is almost complete in dogs when administered with food.
Absorption is 85%-98% in horses and is not affected significantly by feeding.
Absorption was l00% in ruminant calves, with a half-life of 20-43 hours.
Indications and Clinical Uses
 Meloxicam is used to decrease pain, inflammation, and fever. It has been used for
the acute and chronic treatment of pain and inflammation in dogs and cats. One of
the most common uses is osteoarthritis, but it has also been used for pain associated
            
dogs. In studies performed in dogs, higher doses (up to 0.5 mg/kg) were more
effective than lower doses but also were associated with a higher incidence of GI
adverse effects. Use in cats is limited to short-term use or long-term use at low
doses. In cats, meloxicam has comparable, and even superior, effectiveness compared
470  Meloxicam
to butorphanol for treating pain associated with surgery. Acute response to treating
metritis-agalactia syndrome. In horses, meloxicam is effective for treating pain and
 in horses, pigs, and cattle. In these countries the approved use is adjunctive therapy
of acute respiratory disease, diarrhea, and acute mastitis. It has also been effective to
decrease discomfort associated with dehorning procedures in cattle.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Major adverse effects are gastrointestinal, including vomiting, diarrhea, and
ulceration. Because meloxicam appears to be relatively COX-l sparing, adverse
effects are expected to be less than other NSAIDs that are not as selective, but
this has not been demonstrated on controlled clinical trials. Renal toxicity,
especially in dehydrated animals or animals with preexisting renal disease, has
been shown for some NSAIDs. Renal injury has been reported in dogs from
doses of 0.3-0.5 mg/kg and higher. GI ulceration has been observed when dogs
were administered doses slightly higher than registered doses. In cats at high
doses (five times the dose) vomiting and other GI problems were reported. With
repeated doses (9 days) of 0.3 mg/kg/day to cats, inflamed GI mucosa and
ulceration were observed.
Contraindications and Precautions
Dogs and cats with preexisting GI problems or renal problems may be at a
greater risk of adverse efects from NSAIDs. However, at a dose of 0.02 mg/kg
per day, long-term use in cats did not cause progression of renal disease in cats
with pre-existing renal disease. Safety in pregnant animals is not known, but
adverse effects have not been reported. The manufacturer does not recommend
        e i si s 
dogs and can produce hypoglycemia and liver injury with high doses exceeding
0.l g/kg. With approved doses of meloxicam oral solution, the toxic level of
xylitol is not likely to be exceeded, but one should be cautious about adding
other drugs that also contain xylitol.
Drug Interactions
 Do not administer with other NSAIDs or with corticosteroids. Corticosteroids
have been shown to exacerbate the GI adverse effects. Some NSAIDs may
interfere with the action of diuretic drugs and angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE) inhibitors.
Instructions for Use
Liquid medication may be added to food for dosing. When using veterinary liquid
fommulation, the dropper bottle is designed to deliver 0.05 mg per drop or one drop
per pound body weight (two drops per kg body weight). Observe manufacturer's
instructions when using dosing syringe supplied with product.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor GI signs for evidence of diarrhea, GI bleeding, or ulcers. Because of risk of
renal injury, monitor renal parameters (water consumption, BUN, creatinine, and
urine-specific gravity) periodically during treatment.

Meperidine Hydrochloride
meh-pareih-deen hye-droe-klor'ide
Trade and other names: Demerol, Pethidine (European name)
Functional classification: Analgesic, opioid
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Meperidine is a synthetic opioid agonist with activity primarily at the mu-opiate
receptor. It is called pethidine in Europe. It is similar in action to morphine, except
with approximately one seventh of the potency. An intramuscular injection of 75 mg
or an oral dose of 300 mg of meperidine has similar potency to 10 mg of morphine.
Clearance is rapid in small animals after meperidine administration and duration of
effect is short.
Meperidine Hydrochloride473
Indications and Clinical Uses
Meperidine has been used for short-term sedative effects, often used with other
sedatives and/or anesthetics. For analgesic use, it is short-acting, usually less than
2 hours and often much shorter. Therefore its use for treating pain has not been
popular and has been replaced by other opiate drugs. Meperidine may produce
fewer GI motility problems compared to other opioids. The use of meperidine in
human medicine has declined because toxic effects have been observed from
accumulation of metabolites.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Like all opiates, some side effects are predictable and unavoidable. Side effects
include sedation, urine retention, constipation, and bradycardia. Respiratory
chronic administration. Repeated doses in humans may cause toxicity from
accumulation of metabolite. One of the metabolites, normeperidine, accumulates
with repeated administration because it has a half life much longer than
meperidine. The accumulation of the metabolite causes excitatory effects that
may be related to serotonergic properties. Similar reactions have not been
reported from clinical use in animals (see Drug Interactions section for other
precautions).
Contraindications and Precautions
Meperidine is a Schedule II controlled substance. Cats are more sensitive to
M
excitement than other species, although they have tolerated meperidine relatively
well. Avoid repeated doses because accumulation of metabolites may be toxic.
Drug Interactions
Mepenidine should not be administered with monoamine oxidase inhibitors
(MAOIs), such as selegiline. Meperidine and metabolites may inhibit reuptake of
serotonin and cause excess serotonin effect, especially if combined with other
drugs that produce similar action, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(e.g., fluoxetine), tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., clomipramine), or other
analgesics such as tramadol
Instructions for Use
Although comparative clinical studies have not been conducted in animals,
meperidine may be effective for short duration but has not been used for long-term
pain management.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor patient's heart rate and respiration. Although bradycardia rarely needs to be
treated when it is caused by an opioid, atropine can be administered if necessary. If

 meer-oh-pen'em
Trade and other names: Merrem
Functional classification: Antibacterial
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Beta-lactam antibiotic of the carbapenem class (also known as penems) with broad
spectrum of activity related to imipenem. Action on the cell wall is similar to other
beta-lactams, which is to bind penicilin-binding proteins (PBP) that weaken or
interfere with cell wall formation. The carbapenems bind to a specific PBP (PBP-1)
greater bactericidal activity and a longer postantibiotic effect. Carbapenems have
a broad spectrum of activity and are among the most active of all antibiotics.
Spectrum includes gram-negative bacilli, including Enterobacterincene and
Psendomonas aeruginosn. It also is active against most gram-positive bacteria, except
Meropenem is the most active of all beta-lactams and active against aerobe and
anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Other related carbapenems are

Mesalamine
mez-ahl'ah-meen
Trade and other names: 5-aminosalicylic acid, Asacol, Mesasal, Pentasa, and
Mesalazine
Functional classification: Antidiarrheal
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Mesalamine is also known as 5-aminosalicylic acid. It is the active component
of sulfasalazine, which is commonly administered for treatment of colitis. (See
sulfasalazine and olsalazine for additional information.) The action of mesalamine is
 in the intestine. It inhibits both cyclo-oxygenase and lipoxygenase-mediated mucosal
inflammation. Systemic absorption is low; most of the action is believed to be local.
There are four formulations of mesalamine used:
1. Asacol. Asacol is a tablet coated with an acrylic-based resin. The resin
dissolves at a pH of 7.0 and is designed to release 5-aminosalicylic acid in the
colon.
2. Mesasal. Mesasal is a tablet coated with an acrylic-based resin that dissolves at
a pH of >6.0. It is designed to release 5-aminosalicylic acid in the terminal
ileum and colon. Approximately 35% of the salicylate is absorbed systemically.
The dose in people is 1-1.5 g/day.
3. Olsalazine sodium (Dipentum). Olsalazine is a dimer of two molecules of
 5-aminosalicylic acid linked by an azo bond that is released by bacterial
digestion in the colon. It is used in people who cannot tolerate sulfasalazine.
Only 2% of the salicylate from this compound is absorbed systemically. The
most common adverse effect in people from this preparation has been watery
diarrhea.
4. Pentasa. Pentasa contains microgranules of mesalamine coated with ethyl
cellulose, which releases 5-aminosalicylic acid into the small and large intestine
gradually, regardless of pH.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Mesalamine is used for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, including colitis in
animals. Most often sulfasalazine is used; however, in some animals, especially those
sensitive to sulfonamides, mesalamine may be indicated. Use in animals has been
primarily derived from empirical use. There are no well-controlled clinical studies or
efficacy trials to document clinical effectiveness.

Metaproterenol Sulfate 481
Metaproterenol Sulfate
met-ha-proe-teer'eh-nole sul'fate
Trade and other names: Alupent, Metaprel, and Orciprenaline sulphate
Functional classification: Bronchodilator, beta-agonist
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Beta2-adrenergic agonist. Bronchodilator. Like other betaz-agonists, it stimulates
betaz-receptors, activates adenyl cyclase, and relaxes bronchial smooth muscle. It
also may inhibit release of inflammatory mediators, especially from mast cells.
Pharmacokinetics have not been well-studied in the veterinary species. In people it is
well-absorbed from oral administration, but information on oral absorption in
animals is incomplete.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Metaproterenol is used in animals to relax bronchial smooth muscle to treat
bronchitis, obstructive pulmonary disease, airway obstruction caused by
inflammation, and other airway diseases. It is indicated in animals with reversible
bronchoconstriction, such as cats with bronchial asthma. Use in animals has been
primarily derived from empirical use. There are no well-controlled clinical studies or
efficacy trials to document clinical effectiveness.
Precautionary Information
M
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Metaproterenol causes excessive beta-adrenergic stimulation at high doses
(tachycardia and tremors). Arrhythmias occur at high doses or in sensitive
individuals. Beta-agonists will inhibit uterine contractions in animals in labor.

Metformin
met-for'min
Trade and other names: Glucophage
Functional classification: Antihyperglycemic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Metformin is an oral antihyperglycemic agent used to treat noninsulin-dependent
dabetes (Type 2 diabetes in people). Metformin is used to decrease hepatic glucose
production, decrease intestinal absorption of glucose, and improve insulin sensitivity
by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. It is in the biguanide class of
oral drugs for diabetes. Metformin does not have a direct effect on pancreatic beta
cells, but it lowers blood glucose by reducing hepatic glucose production and
improving peripheral utilization of glucose (e.g., in muscle). It thus lowers insulin
requirements without any direct effect to increase insulin secretion. It may increase
the insulin receptors on tissues. At therapeutic doses, metformin will not cause
hypoglycemia. Half-life in cats is 2.75 hours.
Indications and Clinical Uses
 In people, metformin is used to treat Type 2 diabetes. It has been used in people
when the sulfonylurea drugs fail. It has been used in cats to treat diabetes. However,
in cats treated with 50 mg/cat ql2h PO, it showed significant adverse effects and
was effective in only one fifth of treated cats. In cats, it has been more common to
administer the sulfonylurea class of drugs in animals. Sulfonylurea drugs include
glipizide (Glucotrol) and glyburide (DiaBeta, Micronase). Diabetic dogs rarely
respond to oral hypoglycemic agents. In horses, the clearance rate is 10 times that
of humans and, because of poor bioavailability, it is not recommended.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Metformin has caused lethargy, appetite loss, vomiting, and weight loss in cats.
 Use has not been common enough to document other effects. However, in
people, it has caused lactic acidosis in some patients, which was serious.
Metformin also has caused megaloblastic anemia by affecting vitamin B12
absorption.
Methadone Hydrochloride483
Contraindications and Precautions
Metformin is cleared by the kidneys, so doses will need to be adjusted in patients

Doses published for cats are based on pharmacokinetic studies that demonstrated
oral absorption in cats to be 35%-70%. The half-life was 1l.5 hours, which is the
basis for the ql2h dosage recommendation.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Blood glucose should be monitored carefully. Doses should be adjusted on the basis
of glucose monitoring. Some animals may require insulin injections to control
hyperglycemia.

higher affinity for opiate receptors and has been available in a 2.5-mg/mL solution
combined with 0.125 mg per mL fenpipramide (an anticholinergic agent). Other
opiates used in animals include morphine, hydromorphone, codeine, oxymorphone,
meperidine, and fentanyl.
484 Methadone Hydrochloride
Indications and Clinical Uses
Although there are no controlled studies in veterinary medicine to document efficacy
and safety of methadone, the use is based on anecdotal experience and some
pharmacokinetic studies. Methadone is indicated for short-term analgesia, for
Administration of methadone may lower dose requirements for other anesthetics and
analgesics used. Oral doses to dogs are not absorbed systemically.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Like all opiates, side effects from methadone are predictable and unavoidable.
However, some side effects such as excitement and dysphoria seen with other
opiates have not been as common with methadone in dogs and cats. Side effects
from methadone administration may include sedation, vomiting, constipation,

changes in themoregulation. Effects such as excitement and dysphoria have not
been observed with administration of methadone as much as some of the other
opiates.
Contraindications and Precautions
Methadone is a Schedule II controlled substance. Cats may be more sensitive to
excitement than other species, but this has not been examined for methadone.
Drug Interactions
No specific drug interactions have been reported for animals.
Instructions for Use
Oral doses have not been absorbed in dogs. Oral doses have not been evaluated in
other species.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests

Methazolamide
meth-ah-zole'ah-mide
Trade and other names: Neptazane
Functional classification: Diuretic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Methazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Methazolamide, like other
carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, produces a diuresis through inhibition of the uptake
of bicarbonate in proximal renal tubules via enzyme inhibition. This action results in
loss of bicarbonate in the urine and a diuresis. The action of carbonic anhydrase
inhibitors results in urine loss of bicarbonate, alkaline urine, and water loss.
M
Methazolamide, like other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, also decreases formation
of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by the choroid plexus and decreases the ocular fluid
a     a  s   a 
on aqueous humor formation decreases ocular pressure.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Methazolamide is rarely used as a diuretic any longer. There are more potent and
effective diuretic drugs available, such as the loop diuretics (furosemide).
Methazolamide, like other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, is used primarily to lower
intraocular pressure in animals with glaucoma. Its duration is relatively short in
Ocular pressure. Methazolamide is used more often than acetazolamide for this
purpose because it is more effective and easily available. However, other regimens
are commonly used for the treatment of glaucoma compared to the carbonic
anhydrase inhibitors. Methazolamide, like other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, is
sometimes used to produce more alkaline unine for management of some urinary
calculi.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Methazolamide may produce hypokalemia in some patients. Methazolamide, like
other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, can produce significant bicarbonate loss, and
patients should be supplemented with bicarbonate if repeated doses are
administered.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not use in patients with acidemia. Use cautiously in any animal sensitive to
sulfonamides. Do not use in patients with hepatic encephalopathy
486  Methenamine
Drug Interactions
Use cautiously with other treatments that could cause metabolic acidosis
Instructions for Use
Methazolamide may be used with other glaucoma agents, such as topical drugs to

infections. Absorption is rapid and produces a peak effect in urine at 0.5-1.5 hours
and has a half-life of 3-6 hours.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Methenamine is used as a urinary antiseptic. There is a lack of well-controlled
clinical trials to show its effectiveness. However, it has been used in animals to
prevent recurrences of lower UTIs. It is probably less effective for treating ongoing
infections. It is cnitical that the urine pH is low for conversion to formaldehyde.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Although formaldehyde formation in bladder may be irritating, in people, high
doses were required (greater than 8 g/day). In animals, no adverse effects have
been reported.
Contraindications and Precautions
High doses may irnitate bladder mucosa. Do not administer with sulfonamides
tecause it may form formaldehyde-sulfonamide complexes.
Drug Interactions
Do not administer with medications that may cause alkaline urine. Because urine
acidifers are added with methenamine, acid unine will decrease the activity of
fluoroquinolone and aminoglycoside antibiotics. The tablets should be enteric-
coated to protect from hydrolysis in the acid of the stomach and should be

Methimazole
meth-im'ah-zole
Trade and other names: Tapazole, Felimazole, Thiamazole, and generic.
Functional classification: Antithyroid agent
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antithyroid drug. Action is to serve as substrate for thyroid peroxidase (TPO),
to inhibit it and decrease incorporation of iodide into tyrosine molecules for the
formation of thyroxine (T4) and triodothyronine (T3). Methimazole inhibits
coupling of mono-iodinated and di-iodinated residues to form T4 and T3.
Methimazole does not inhibit release of prefomed thyroid hormone.
Methimazole does not affect existing thyroid hormones already circulating or
to T3. It generally takes 2 to 4 weeks for serum T4 to reach the normal range
 in hyperthyroid cats treated with methimazole. Carbimazole is a similar drug
used in Europe that is converted to methimazole in animals. Methimazole also may
have immunosuppressive effects. Treatment may decrease antithyrotropin-receptor
antibodies. Methimazole has a half- life of 2.3 hours in hyperthyroid cats and 4.7
hours in normal cats.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Methimazole is used to treat hyperthyroidism in animals, especially cats. There is
good evidence for efficacy when administered to cats at recommended doses.
Methimazole is preferred in cats instead of propylthiouracil (PTU) because
methimazole has a lower incidence of adverse effects. Evidence supports twice-daily
dosing in cats as more effective than once daily. Methimazole has been formulated
for use in cats as a transdermal gel for skin absorption (e.g., those combined with
pluronic organogel [PLO] gel). These formulations are available through
compounding pharmacies. Published data indicate that transdermal methimazole
is not as rapidly acting, or as effective, as oral dosing, but it can be effective to
reduce T4 concentrations in many cats. An alternative drug that has been used is
carbimazole, which is converted to the active drug methimazole. It may produce less
frequent GI problems. However, experience with carbimazole is limited in the
United States (see carbimazole section for more details).
Methimazole489
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
In cats, GI problems are the most common and can include anorexia and
vomiting. Most adverse effects caused by methimazole are dose related and can
be decreased by lowering the dose. In cats, polyarthritis, alopecia, and scaling and
rusting of the head and face have been observed, which may be a manifestation
of an allergic reaction. In cats, lupus-like reactions are possible, such as vasculitis
and bone marrow changes. In cats, abnormal platelet counts and low blood
counts can develop after 1-3 months of treatment. Bleeding abnormalities may
be related to thrombocytopenia, but tests conducted in cats did not demonstrate
prolongation of bleeding times (prothrombin time and activated partial
antithromboplastin time). There were fewer adverse GI effects when methimazole
was applied as a transdermal gel compared to administration as an oral tablet.
Methimazole treatment may unmask hypothyroidism and renal failure in some
cats. Monitor renal function with continued treatment.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not administer to animals with thrombocytopenia or bleeding problems.
Other drugs such as beta blockers are safe to administer with methimazole.
Warn pet owners that transdermal methimazole can be absorbed through human
skin. If an animal has had an adverse reaction to propylthiouracil (PTU), there
may also be cross-sensitivity to methimazole. Methimazole has caused fetal
abnormalities and should not be used in pregnant animals.
Drug Interactions
There are no drug interactions reported from the use in animals.
Instructions for Use
 Use in cats is based on clinical studies in hyperthyroid cats and information from the
feline drug sponsor. Methimazole has, for the most part, replaced propylthiouracil
(PTU) for use in cats. Adjust maintenance dose by monitoring thyroid (T4)
concentrations in plasma. Because it does not inhibit release of prefomed thyroid,
it may take 2-4 weeks to achieve maximum effect. When methimazole dosing
frequency was evaluated, dosing with 2.5 mg ql2h PO was more effective than
5 mg q24h PO. If prepared as a transdermal gel, it is recommended to use a PLO
formulation consisting of 0.15 g methimazole, 100 g lecithin soya, 100 g isopropyl
palmitate, 0.66 g of sorbic acid powder, and 20% pluronic F127 gel. Final
concentration should be 5 mg/0.l mL of transdermal gel applied to the inner ear.
Transdermal gel may be less effective than oral tablets.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor serum T4 levels. Recheck T4 levels after first month of treatment. After
methimazole treatment is stabilized, T3 and T4 are suppressed for 24 hours after
each dose of methimazole. Therefore, timing of blood sample after oral

effectiveness of treatment. (Feline TSH has 96% homology with canine TSH.)
Monitor CBC and platelet count in cats every week or l4 days for the first 30 days
of treatment. Monitor tests of renal finction because of concern about increased risk
of renal disease in some cats. Methimazole may affect thyroid scintigraphy tests.
After treatment, there may be a stimulation from TSH for tissues to have enhanced
uptake of 99mTcO4 by the thyroid gland.
490   Methocarbamol
Formulations
Methimazole is available in 2.5- and 5-mg coated tablets (veterinary form) and
5- and l0-mg tablets (human form).
Stability and Storage
Methimazole is stable if maintained in its original formulation. However, if prepared
in compounded formulations for cats, potency and stability may be less. Potency is
assured for 2 weeks with compounded transdermal gel.
Small Animal Dosage
Cats
· 2.5 mg/cat ql2h PO for 7-14 days, then 5-10 mg/cat PO q12h and monitor T4
concentrations.
· In some cats, once T4 levels have been normalized, the dose can be decreased to
10-15 mg/cat once a day.
· Transdermal dose: 2.5 mg/cat transdermally twice daily. Alternate ears with each
dose and wear gloves when applying.

Methocarbamol
meth-oh-karbah-mole
Trade and other names: Robaxin-V
Functional classification: Muscle relaxant
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
muscle relaxation.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Methocarbamol has been used for the treatment of skeletal muscle spasms and
increased muscle tone. It has also been used to treat pain that is associated with
increased muscle spasms or myositis. Higher doses than listed in the dosing section
are recommended if it is used for treating tetanus. However, evidence for efficacy in
animals is lacking. For some indications (e.g., muscle spasms) methocarbamol has
been replaced by other muscle relaxants such as orphenadrine (Norflex). In horses,
the half-life is only 60-90 minutes and may need frequent administration for
effectiveness.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Methocarbamol may cause depression and sedation of the CNS. Excess salivation,
emesis, weakness, and ataxia have been observed from methocarbamol
administration. Adverse effects are usually short in duration.

Trade and other names: MTX, Mexate, Folex, Rheumatrex, and generic brands
Functional classification: Anticancer agent
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
       n   
is similar to folic acid, and methotrexate binds and inhibits the dihydrofolate
Methotrexate 493
reductase enzyme (DHFR). The DHFR enzyme is a reducing enzyme necessary for
purine synthesis. The reduced form of folic acid (tetrahydrofolate, FH4) acts as an
important coenzyme for biochemical reactions, particularly DNA, RNA, and protein
synthesis.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Methotrexate is used for various carcinomas, leukemia, and lymphomas. In people,
methotrexate is also commonly used for autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid
arthritis. Use in animals has been primarily derived from empinical use. There are no
well-controlled clinical studies or efficacy trials to document clinical effectiveness.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Its major adverse effects in animals are anorexia, nausea, myelosuppression, and
vomiting. Anticancer drugs cause predictable (and sometimes unavoidable)
side effects that include bone marrow suppression, leukopenia, and
immunosuppression. Hepatotoxicity has been reported in people from
methotrexate therapy, but this has not been documented in veterinary medicine.
In people, higher doses are often used compared to veterinary doses. In people,
risk of systemic toxicity is high and rescue therapy with leukovorin
(tetrahydrofolic acid) is often used. Leukovorin rescue therapy is used because it
is an antagonist of the action of methotrexate on the DHFR enzyme.
Contraindications and Precautions
M
Do not administer to pregnant animals. It has been used to induce abortion.
Drug Interactions
Concurrent use with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may
cause severe methotrexate toxicity. Do not administer with pyrimethamine,
tmimethopnim, sulfonamides, or other drugs that may affect folic acid synthesis.
Instructions for Use
Use in animals has been based on experimental studies. Only limited clinical
information is available. Consult specific anticancer protocols for precise dosage and
regimen.

Trade and other names: Metofane
Functional classification: Anesthetic, inhalant
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Inhalant anesthetic. Like other inhalent anesthetics, the mechanism of action is
uncertain. They produce generalized, reversible depression of the CNS. The inhalant
anesthetics vary in their solubility in blood, their potency, and the rate of induction
and recovery. Those with low blood/gas partition coefficients are associated with
the most rapid rates of induction and recovery.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Methoxyflurane is not used often as an inhalant anesthetic. In the past l0 years use
has declined and been replaced by other agents.
Precautionary Information

Methylene Blue 0.1%
meth'ih-leen bloo
Trade and other names: New Methylene Blue and generic brands
Functional classification: Antidote
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Methylene blue acts as a reducing agent to reduce methemoglobin to hemoglobin.
The action of methylene blue is particularly important when it is used to convert
methemoglobin to hemoglobin in erythrocytes. It is reduced to leucomethylene blue
in the body by combining with reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
(NADPH) in the presence of NADPH reductase. Leucomethylene blue then transfers
result of oxidative damage to hemoglobin, and methylene blue has been used as an
antidote for intoxication. Sources of intoxication in animals that cause
methemoglobinemia include exposure to nitrate, nitrite, or chlorate in ruminants;
acetaminophen and naphthalene (mothballs) in cats (and occasionally dogs); and local
anesthetics, such as benzocaine, in cats. For acetaminophen toxicity in cats,
acetylcysteine may provide a better response.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Methylene blue is used to treat methemoglobinemia caused by chlorate and nitrate
toxicosis. It also has been used to treat cyanide toxicosis.

Methylnaltrexone Bromide
meth'ihl nal-trex-own broe'-mide
Trade and other names: Relistor
Functional classification: Prokinetic agent, intestinal stimulant
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Methylnaltrexone is a modified quarternary form of naltrexone that has opiate-
antagonist properties. Because it is modified from naltrexone and charged, it does
not cross the blood-brain barrier and it has no centrally acting opiate inhibition,
but it will antagonize peripheral mu-receptors in the intestine to restore motility
after postsurgical ileus. Opiate mu-receptors in the intestine ordinarily inhibit
motility when stimulated because of pain or opiated drug administration. Another
dnug related to methylnaltrexone and used for similar purposes is alvimopan
(Entereg).
Indications and Clinical Uses
Methylnaltrexone is approved for use in people to restore intestinal motility after
surgery, after opiate administration, or when caused by a disorder (e.g., severe pain)
that has stimulated mu-opiate receptors in the intestine. Use in animals is limited

Trade and other names: Methylprednisolone: Medrol; Methylprednisolone
acetate: Depo-Medrol; and Methylprednisolone sodium succinate: Solu-Medrol
Functional classification: Corticosteroid
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Methylprednisolone is a glucocorticoid anti-inflammatory drug. Anti-inflammatory
effects are complex, but they operate primarily via inhibition of inflammatory
cells and suppression of expression of inflammatory mediators. Compared to
prednisolone, methylprednisolone is 1.25 times more potent.
Methylprednisolone499
Indications and Clinical Uses
Methylprednisolone acetate is a long-acting depot fomulation of
methylprednisolone. It is slowly absorbed from the intramuscular injection site
producing glucocorticoid effects for 3-4 weeks in some animals. Methylprednisolone
acetate is used for intralesional therapy, intra-articular therapy, and inflammatory
conditions. Methylprednisolone sodium succinate is a water-soluble formulation
intended for acute therapy when high intravenous doses are needed for rapid effect.
It is used for treatment of shock and CNS trauma. Methylprednisolone oral tablets
are used for treatment of conditions in animals that require short-term to long-term
therapy with an intermediate-acting corticosteroid. Conditions treated include
dermatitis, immune-mediated diseases, intestinal diseases, and neurological and
musculoskeletal diseases. Although high doses have been used to treat spinal
cord trauma, this use has questionable benefit in animals. In large animals,
methylprednisolone acetate is used for treatment of inflammatory conditions of the
musculoskeletal system (intra-articular).
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Side effects from corticosteroids are many and include polyphagia, polydipsia/
polyuria, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression. However,
the manufacturer suggests that methylprednisolone causes less polyuria/polydipsia
(PU/PD) than prednisolone. Adverse effects include GI ulceration, hepatopathy,
diabetes, hyperlipidemia, decreased thyroid homone, decreased protein synthesis,

Contraindications and Precautions
Use cautiously in patients prone to ulcers and infection or in animals in which
wound healing is necessary. Use cautiously in diabetic animals, animals with renal
 filure, or pregnant animals. Use cautiously in cats because of volume expansion,
especially cats at risk of CHF.
Drug Interactions
Like other corticosteroids, if methylprednisolone is administered with
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), there is increased risk of GI
ulcers.
Instructions for Use
Use of methylprednisolone is similar to other corticosteroids. Dose adjustment
should be made to account for difference in potency. Use of methylprednisolone
acetate should be evaluated carefully because one injection will cause glucocorticoid
effects that persist for several days to weeks. Results of clinical studies in animals
have not been reported for use of methylprednisolone sodium succinate.

502Metoclopramide Hydrochloride
Metoclopramide Hydrochloride
met-oh-kloe-prah'mide hye-droe-kloride
Trade and other names: Reglan and Maxolon
Functional classification: Antiemetic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Prokinetic drug. Antiemetic. Metoclopramide stimulates motility of upper GI tract
not completely understood. Among the proposed mechanisms is stimulation of
5-HT4 (serotonin) receptors or an increase in the release of acetylcholine in the GI
tract, possibly through a prejunctional mechanism. It also has anti-dopamine (D2)
action. It inhibits gastric relaxation induced by dopamine, thus enhancing the
cholinergic responses of gastric smooth muscle to increase motility. It also increases
the tone of the esophageal sphincter. Metoclopramide acts centrally to inhibit
dopamine in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CRTZ), which is responsible for
antiemetic effects. The half-life in dogs has ranged from less than l hour to 2 hours;
effects on esophageal sphincter persisted for only 30-60 minutes.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Metoclopramide is used primarily for gastroparesis and treatment of vomiting. It is
not effective for dogs with gastric dilation. Because this drug transiently increases
prolactin secretion, there has been interest in using this drug for treating agalactia in
animals, but efficacy has not been detemined. In horses, it has been used to treat
intestinal postoperative ileus, but adverse effects have limited the use. In people,
metoclopramide has been also used to treat hiccups and lactation deficiency.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects are primarily related to blockade of central dopaminergic
receptors. Adverse effects similar to what is reported for phenothiazines (e.g*
acepromazine) have been reported in addition to behavioral changes. In horses,
undesirable side effects have been common and limit the therapeutic use. Adverse
effects in horses include behavioral changes, excitement, and abdominal
discomfort. Excitement from intravenous infusions can be severe. In calves at
doses >0.l mg/kg, it produced neurologic effects.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not use in patients with epilepsy or with diseases caused by GI obstruction.
Use cautiously in horses because dangerous behavior changes may occur. In
people, it has been safe to use in the first trimester of pregnancy.
Drug Interactions
 Effcacy is diminished when administered with parasympatholytic (atropine-like)
drugs.

Metoprolol Tartrate
 meh-toe^proe-lole tar'trate
Trade and other names: Lopressor
Functional classification: Beta blocker
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Beta-adrenergic blocker. Metoprolol has similar properties to propranolol, except
that metoprolol is specific for betaj-receptor, with less effect on betaz-receptors.
Metoprolol is a lipophilic beta blocker and relies on the liver for clearance. Lipophilic
beta blockers, such as metoprolol, undergo high first-pass clearance, which reduces
oral bioavailability and causes high interpatient variability in plasma concentrations
and effects. Alternative beta, blockers used in animals include atenolol.
504  Metoprolol Tartrate
Indications and Clinical Uses
Metoprolol is used to control tachyarrhythmias and to control the response from
adrenergic stimulation. Beta blockers effectively slow heart rate. Metoprolol is used
in animals in which it is important to control ventricular rate, decrease conduction
through the AV and SA nodes, and improve diastolic function. In animals it has
been used for tachyarrhythmias, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, atrial fbrillation, and
other cardiac diseases. Use in animals has been primarily denived from empirical use.
There are no well-controlled clinical studies or efficacy trials to document clinical
effectiveness.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects are primarily caused by excessive cardiovascular depression
(decreased inotropic effects). Metoprolol may cause AV block.
Contraindications and Precautions
Use cautiously in animals prone to bronchoconstriction.
Drug Interactions
Lipophilic beta blockers, such as metoprolol, are subject to hepatic metabolism
and may be prone to drug interactions that affect hepatic metabolizing enzymes.
 If administered with digoxin, it may potentiate an AV-nodal conduction block.
Instructions for Use

Metronidazole, Metronidazole Benzoate 505
Metronidazole, Metronidazole Benzoate
meh-troe-nye'dah-zole
Trade and other names: Flagyl and genenic brands
Functional classification: Antibacterial, antiparasitic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antibacterial and antiprotozoal drug. It is a second-generation nitroimidazole in
which the activity involves generation of free nitroradicals via metabolism within
protozoa and bacteria. Metronidazole disrupts DNA in organism via reaction with
intracellular metabolite. Its action is specific for anaerobic bacteria and protozoa.
Resistance is rare. It is active against some protozoa, including Trichomonas,
Giardin, and intestinal protozoal parasites. It also has in vitro activity against
anaerobic bacteria and Helicobacter. Metronidazole oral absorption is nearly
complete in animals (75%-85% in horses and 60%-100% in dogs). Rectal absorption
in horses is 30%. The half-life is 3-4 hours in horses and 4-5 hours in dogs.
Metronidazole benzoate is formulated for cats to improve palatability. In this form,
the oral absorption (12.4 mg/kg of the base) is 64%, with a half-life of 5 hours.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Metronidazole is indicated to treat diarrhea and other intestinal problems caused by
intestinal protozoa such as Giardia, Trichomonas and Entamoeba. Metronidazole
may be used in small animals and horses for treatment of a variety of anaerobic
M
infections. Metronidazole may have some immune-modulating activity in the
intestine of animals and has been used to treat inflammatory bowel disease in
animals. Metronidazole benzoate has been used in cats because it is more palatable.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
The most severe adverse effect is caused by toxicity to CNS. High doses have
caused lethargy, CNS depression, ataxia, tremors, seizures, vomiting, and
weakness. Most CNS toxicity caused from metronidazole in animals occurs at
of GABA and are responsive to benzodiazepines (diazepam 0.4 mg/kg q8h for
3 days). Like other nitroimidazoles, it has the potential to produce mutagenic
changes in cells, but the clinical significance of this effect is uncertain. Like other
mitroimidazoles, it has a bitter taste and can cause vomiting and anorexia.
Metronidazole benzoate has been used in some cats safely at 25 mg/kg ql2h for
7 days. However, there is a caution about the effect of benzoate salts in cats
because it is a benzoic acid denivative. Benzoic acid can be toxic to cats and
causes ataxia, blindness, respiratory problems, and other CNS disorders. Despite
would be needed to provide a toxic dose of benzoic acid to cats. Nevertheless,
any cat showing CNS or other signs of toxicity should have the metronidazole
benzoate discontinued immediately.
Contraindications and Precautions
Fetal abnormalities have not been demonstrated in animals with recommended
doses, but use cautiously during pregnancy.
506 Metronidazole, Metronidazole Benzoate
Drug Interactions
 Like other nitroimidazoles, it can potentiate the effects of warfarin and
cyclosponine via inhibition of drug metabolism.
Instructions for Use
Metronidazole is one of the most commonly used drugs for anaerobic infections.
albendazole, fenbendazole, and quinacrine. CNS toxicity is a concern, but it is dose
related. The maximum dose that should be administered is 50-65 mg/kg per day in
any species. Metronidazole is unpalatable and can produce a metallic taste. In cats,
when the tablet is crushed or broken, the unpalatability is particularly a problem.
Metronidazole benzoate has a bland taste and is better tolerated. It is a formulation
compounding pharmacies. Metronidazole benzoate of 25 mg/mL contains 40 mg
of benzoate. Because of the weight of metronidazole benzoate versus metronidazole
hydrochlonide, a factor of 1.6 times is used to convert a metronidazole
hydrochlonide dose to a metronidazole benzoate dose. Metronidazole benzoate is
62% metronidazole; therefore 20 mg/kg of metronidazole benzoate delivers
12.4 mg/kg of metronidazole.
Metronidazole should not be injected directly; it is too acidic. See Stability and
Storage section for mixing instructions.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor for neurological adverse effects.
Formulations
Metronidazole is available in 250- and 500-mg tablets, 375-mg capsules, 50-mg/
mL suspension, and 5-mg/mL injection.
Metronidazole benzoate is a formulation not available in the US but has been
compounded for veterinary use. Metronidazole benzoate is 62% metronidazole.
 Metronidazole benzoate has been formulated in Oral-Plus and Ora-Sweet (drug
excipients) to a concentration of l6 mg/mL and was stable at room temperature
for 90 days.
Stability and Storage
The base is slightly soluble in water. The benzoate form is practically insoluble;
the hydrochlonide form is soluble in water. Metronidazole has been crushed
and mixed with some flavorings to mask the taste. When mixed with some
syrups or water, with exceptions listed here, decomposition occurs within 28 days.
Metronidazole benzoate prepared in vehicles such as Ora-Plus or Ora-Sweet
was stable for 90 days. Metronidazole base (from tablets) also was mixed with
these vehicles and was found to be stable for 90 days. Reconstituted injectable
forms are stable for 96 hours but after dilution should be discarded after
24 hours.
Metronidazole hydrochloride when reconstituted is too acidic (pH 0.5-2)
for direct injection. Injection of 5 mg/mL should be further diluted with
100 mL (0.9% saline, 5% dextrose, or Ringer's solution) and neutralized with
5 mEq sodium bicarbonate per 500 mg for a pH of 6-7. Reconstituted
injectable forms are stable for 96 hours but after dilution should be discarded after
24 hours.

Midazolam Hydrochloride
mid'az'oe-lam hye-droe-klor'ide
Trade and other names: Versed
Functional classification: Anticonvulsant, Sedative
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Benzodiazepine. Central-acting CNS depressant. Midazolam, like other
benzodiazepines, binds to a specific GABA-binding site. It may modify the GABA-
binding sites and increase the action of GABA on nerve cells. Sedative effects of
release of monoamine neurotransmitters in the CNS. Benzodiazepines may act as
muscle relaxants by inhibiting certain spinal pathways or directly depressing motor
nerve and muscle function.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Midazolam is used as an anesthetic adjunct. It is used for similar indications as
diazepam, but because it is water soluble, midazolam can be administered in an
510 Midazolam Hydrochloride
aqueous vehicle and administered IM compared to other drugs of this class (drugs
such as diazepam are not water soluble).
It has been used as an anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, sedative, and adjunct with
anesthetic agents. In foals, it has been used to treat neonatal seizures {see dose
protocols).
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Midazolam administered IV can cause serious cardiorespiratory depression. Some

safely with several anesthetics, sedatives, preanesthetics, and anticonvulsants.
Instructions for Use
some anesthetic protocols for animals. Unlike other benzodiazepines, midazolam can
be administered IM.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Samples of plasma or serum may be analyzed for concentrations of benzodiazepines.
Plasma concentrations in the range of l00-250 ng/mL have been cited as the
therapeutic range for people. Other references have cited this range as 150-300 ng/
mL. However, there are no readily available tests for monitoring in many veterinary
benzodiazepines. With these assays, there may be cross-reactivity among
benzodiazepine metabolites.
Formulations
Midazolam is available in 5-mg/mL injection.
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature.
Solubility of midazolam in water is pH-dependent. At lower pH values (pH <4), it

Milbemycin Oxime
mil-beh-mye'sin ahk'seem
Trade and other names: Interceptor, Interceptor Flavor Tabs, and SafeHeart
Milbemycin also is an ingredient in Sentinel.
Functional classification: Antiparasitic
M
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antiparasitic drug. Avermectins (ivemectin-like drugs) and milbemycins
(milbemycin and moxidectin) are macrocyclic lactones and share similarities,
including mechanism of action. These drugs are neurotoxic to parasites by
potentiating glutamate-gated chloride ion channels in parasites. Paralysis and
death of the parasite is caused by increased permeability to chloride ions and
hyperpolarization of nerve cells. These drugs also potentiate other chloride channels,
including ones gated by GABA. Mammals ordinarily are not affected because they
lack glutamate-gated chloride channels, and there is a lower affinity for other
mammalian chloride channels. Because these drugs ordinarily do not penetrate the
blood-brain barrier, GABA-gated channels in the CNS of mammals are not affected.
Milbemycin is active against intestinal parasites, mites, bots, heartworm microfilaria,
and developing larvae. Milbermycin has no effect on trematode or cestode parasites.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Milbemycin is used as heartworm preventative, miticide, and microflaricide. It is
also used to control infections of hookworm, roundworms, and whipworms. It also
has been used in combination with flea control drugs (See Sentinel, which contains
milbemycin oxime and lufenuron.) At high doses it has been used to treat Demodex
infections in dogs.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
At doses of 5 mg/kg, it was well-tolerated in most dogs (10 times the
heartworm dose). At 10 mg/kg (20 times the heartworm dose), it caused

and in breeds in which milbemycin crosses the blood-brain barner at doses as
low as l.5 mg/kg per day. Sensitive breeds include Collies, Australian shepherds,
Old English sheepdogs, longhaired Whippets, and Shetland sheepdogs. Toxicity
is neurotoxic and signs include depression, ataxia, difficulty with vision, coma,
and death. Sensitivity to milbemycin occurs in certain breeds because of a
mutation in the multidrug resistance gene (MDRl, also called the ABCBl gene)
that codes for the membrane pump p-glycoprotein. This mutation affects the
eflux pump in the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, milbemycin can accumulate in
the brain of susceptible animals. High doses in normal animals may also produce
similar toxicosis. However, at doses used for heartworm prevention, this effect is
unlikely. At high doses used for treating Demodex infections, diarrhea may occur
in some dogs.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not use in dogs that have shown sensitivity to ivermectin or other drugs in
this class (see previous breed list). Treatment using three times the daily doses
from mating to l week before weaning did not produce any adverse effects in the
pregnant bitch, the fetus, or puppies. One-time doses of three times the monthly
rate before or shortly after whelping caused no adverse effects on the puppies.

Minocycline Hydrochloride
min-oh-sye'Kleen hye-droe-kloride
Trade and other names: Minocin, Solodyn
Functional classification: Antibacterial
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Tetracycline antibiotic. Like other tetracyclines, the mechanism of action of
minocycline is to bind to 30S ribosomal subunit and inhibit protein synthesis. It is
usually bacteriostatic. It has a broad spectrum of activity including gram-positive
and gram-negative bacteria, some protozoa, Rickettsiae, and Ehrlichiae. Resistance
among Staplylococcus species and gram-negative bacilli is common. Minocycline
also may have some anti-inflammatory properties that may benefit joint diseases.
Minocycline has a similar pharmacokinetic profle to doxycycline, but it is less
protein binding. In horses, oral minocycline at 4 mg/kg every 12 hours produced a
peak concentration of 0.6 mcg/mL and had a half-life of approximately 13 hours;
after IV administration at 2.2 mg/kg the half-life is 7.7 hours.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Minocycline is used when tetracyclines are indicated for treating bacterial infections
in animals. It may be effective for Rickettsiae and Ehrlichiae infections. The other
oral tetracycline most often used in animals is doxycycline.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects have not been reported for minocycline. It has been used safely
in experimental animals without adverse effects. However, as with any oral
tetracycline, changes in intestinal microflora could increase risk of diarrhea in
some animals.
Contraindications and Precautions
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions are reported for animals. Oral absorption is not affected by
calcium products as much as with other tetracyclines.
Instructions for Use
Minocycline has received little attention for clinical veterinary use in
North America. Clinical use has not been reported, but properties are similar to
Mirtazapine  515
doxycycline. Doxycycline is more commonly used as the tetracycline of choice in
small animals.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Susceptibility testing: CLSI break points for sensitive organisms are ≤2 mcg/mL for
streptococci and <4 for other organisms. T'etracycline is used as a marker to test
susceptibility for other drugs in this class such as doxycycline, minocycline, and
oxytetracycline.
Formulations
Minocycline is available in 50-, 75-, and 100-mg tablets and capsules and 10-mg/
mL favored oral suspension. Vials for injection should be reconstituted in 5 mL and
then diluted in 500-1,000 mL for IV infusion. Solution may be stored at room

Mirtazapine
Mir taz' a peen
Trade and other names: Remeron
Functional classification: Antiemetic agent
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Mirtazapine is used as an antiemetic in animals, but in people it also has antidepressant
and anxiolytic activity. The antiemetic action is via blockade of serotonin (5HT3,
5HT2, and 5HT,) receptors and antagonism of alphaz-receptors. Because it is active on
three serotonin receptors, it is not as selective as ondansetron and other related drugs
that affect 5HT receptors. Presynaptic alphaz antagonism increases noradrenergic and
serotonergic transmission. Serotonin 5HT, and 5HT; receptors are blocked
postsynaptically. After administration to cats, the half-life was 15 hours after a high
dose (3.75 mg per cat) and 10 hours after a low dose (1.9 mg per cat).
Indications and Clinical Uses
Mirtazapine is used as an antiemetic and appetite stimulant, primarily in cats.
Although there also has been some use in dogs, it is primarly anecdotal. After
516   Mirtazapine
introduction of other antiemetics for animals (e.g., maropitant) the use of
mirtazapine has declined. Use in animals has been primarily derived from empirical
use. There are no well-controlled clinical studies or efficacy trials to document
clinical effectiveness.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects have not been commonly reported because of the infrequent use.
However, some adverse effects in cats—such as twitching and other abnormal
reported. Some antihistaminic effects have been reported. Sedation observed in
people has not been as common in animals.
Contraindications and Precautions
No known contraindications in animals.
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions have been reported for animals. However, avoid use with
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors
(MAOIs) such as selegiline.

Misoprostol  517
Misoprostol
mee-soe-pross'tole
Trade and other names: Cytotec
Functional classification: Antiulcer agent
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Misoprostol is a synthetic prostaglandin. It is a synthetic analogue of PGE, and
and people to decrease the injury to GI mucosa caused by nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin. In studies in dogs, misoprostol was
not effective for decreasing adverse effects caused by corticosteroids. Misoprostol
also has anti-inflammatory effects and has been used to treat pruritus in dogs.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Misoprostol is used to decrease the risk of GI ulceration when administered
concurrently with NSAIDs. Effcacy has been established for this indication in trials
with aspinin but not with other NSAIDs in animals. There is no evidence to show
that it decreases GI bleeding caused from other drugs (e.g., corticosteroids). Clinical
trials also are available to show that misoprostol is effective for treating pruritus in
patients with atopic dermatitis, although it is less effective than other drugs.
Precautionary Information
M
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects are caused by effects of prostaglandins. Most common side effect
is GI discomfort, vomiting, and diarrhea.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not administer to pregnant animals; it may cause abortion. Women should
handle this medication carefully because it can induce abortion.
Drug Interactions
 No drug interactions reported for animals.

Mitotane
mye'toe-tane
Trade and other names: Lysodren and op-DDD
Functional classification: Adrenolytic agent
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
 Mitotane is a cytotoxic agent. Mitotane binds to adrenal proteins and is then
converted to a reactive metabolite, which then destroys cells of the zona fasciculata
and zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex. Destruction of the adrenal cells is
relatively specific and can be complete or partial, depending on the dose used. If
only partial destruction of adrenal cortical cells occurs, repeated administration or
maintenance doses are needed to suppress hypercortisolemia.
Mitotane is a highly lipophilic drug. It is poorly absorbed without food, but oral
absorption is enhanced when administered with food or oil
Indications and Clinical Uses
 Mitotane is used primarily to treat pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism (PDH)
(Cushing's disease). It also has been used to treat adrenal tumors. Treatment is
initiated with a loading dose, followed by weekly maintenance doses. Other drugs
Treatment with mitotane has been compared with trilostane and has shown that
each drug, although acting through different mechanisms, produces similar survival
times in dogs with PDH.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects, especially during the induction period, include lethargy,
weakness, anorexia, ataxia, depression, and vomiting. Discontinue if signs of
liver disease are observed. Adverse effects may occur in 25%-30% of dogs.
Corticosteroid supplementation (e.g., hydrocortisone or prednisolone) may be
administered to minimize side effects (prednisone dose 0.25 mg/kg/day). In
some dogs, adverse neurologic signs may be observed, which include ataxia, head
pressing, and blindness. CNS effects are the result of enlargement of the pituitary
gland in response to suppression of the adrenal cortex and lack of feedback by
cortisol. Loss of feedback control stimulates CRH and ACTH secretion.
Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride 519
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not administer to animals unless there is an ability to monitor response with

consumption, appetite, and behavior. Adverse effects are common during initial
therapy. Administration with food increases oral absorption. The maintenance dose
should be adjusted on the basis of periodic cortisol measurements and ACTH
stimulation tests. Prednisolone at 0.25 mg/kg is sometimes administered as a
replacement in patients with PDH during the induction treatment. Trilostane, an
approved drug for dogs, has also been used instead of mitotane in dogs and should
be considered when dogs do not respond to or tolerate mitotane. Cats usually have
not responded to mitotane treatment.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor water consumption and appetite during the induction phase. Monitor
ACTH response test to adjust dose. Monitor electrolytes periodically to screen for
hyperkalemia that could result from adrenal destruction (iatrogenic

Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride
mye-toe-zan'trone hye-droe-kloride
Trade and other names: Novantrone
Functional classification:Anticancer agent
520 Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Anticancer antibiotic. Mitoxantrone is an anticancer agent that is similar to
doxorubicin in action. Like doxonubicin, it acts to intercalate between bases on
DNA, disrupting DNA and RNA synthesis in tumor cells. Mitoxantrone may affect
tumor cell membranes.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Mitoxantrone is used in anticancer drug protocols in animals for treatment of
leukemia, lymphoma, and carcinomas.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
As with all anticancer agents, certain adverse effects are predictable and
unavoidable and related to the drug's action. Mitoxantrone produces
myelosuppression, vomiting, anorexia, and GI upset, but it may be less
cardiotoxic than doxorubicin.
Contraindications and Precautions
 Do not administer to animals with bone marrow suppression.
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions are reported for animals.
Instructions for Use
Proper use of mitoxantrone usually follows a specific anticancer protocol. Doses
lsted are based on input from reputable oncologists, but consult specifc protocol
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor CBC to look for evidence of bone marrow toxicity.
Formulations
Mitoxantrone is available in 2-mg/mL injection.
Stability and Storage

Mitratapide  52l
Mitratapide
Mi-trat'-a-pyed
Trade and other names: Yarvitan
Functional classification: Weight loss medication
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Mitratapide is used to produce weight loss in dogs. It is related to another
medication used for obesity in dogs, dirlotapide (Slentrol). Mitratapide is an
inhibitor of the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP). Inhibition of this
enzyme reduces the ability of intestinal enterocyces to process triglycerides. The
accumulation of these triglycerides in the intestinal cells sends a signal to the central
nervous system to suppress the appetite. In dogs the effect on the intestinal cells
reduces the uptake of dietary lipids in association with decreased postprandial serum
tiglycerides, phospholipids, and cholesterol. The accumulation of triglycerides inside
the enterocytes can be observed macroscopically and histopathologically. The weight
loss is attributed to the reduced appetite, rather than impaired processing of dietary
lipids. It does not produce a direct centrally acting effect. Bioavailability of oral
mitratapide is 16%-21%, with a large volume of distribution (VD) of 5 l/kg.
It is highly protein bound (99%). It has a plasma half-life of 6.3 hours for
mitratapide and longer (9.8, 1l.7, 44.7 hours) for various metabolites, some of
which are active.
M
Indications and Clinical Uses
Mitratapide is used in the management of obesity in dogs. During the treatment
protocol, there is a relatively moderate loss of weight,(6%-7% of the weight before
treatment). It should not be used without instituting the proper protocol, as
outlined by the sponsor. It should be used in an overall weight management
program, which also includes appropriate dietary changes. Before using to treat
overweight or obesity, rule out other diseases such as hypothyroidism or
hyperadrenocorticism. At this time, it is approved in Europe, but it has not been
approved in the US. It should not be used in cats.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Decreased appetite occurs as a mode of action of the drug. Vomiting may also
Dccur as a common effect related to the drug's mechanism of action. Nausea and
diarrhea also may occur. None of these signs are necessarily cause to stop the
medication, and they may resolve with time. However, if vomiting and nausea
persist, evaluation and adjustment of dose may be necessary. Administration with
food may decrease vomiting. Changes in liver enzymes also are expected. There
may be decreases in serum albumin, globulin, total protein, calcium, and alkaline
phosphatase and increases in ALT associated with treatment. Hyperkalemia may
also be observed. The severity of these changes is proportional to dose. These
changes may normalize after continued treatment. There may be decreased
absorption of fat-soluble vitamins A and E. The reduced absorption of these
vitamins has not been clinically significant.

Morphine Sulfate 523
Morphine Sulfate
mor'feen sul'fate
Trade and other names: Generic brands, MS Contin extended-release tablets,
Oramorph SR extended-release tablets, and generic brand extended-release
tablets
Functional classification: Analgesic, opioid
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Opioid agonist, analgesic. Prototype for other opioid agonists. Action of morphine
is to bind to mu-opiate and kappa-opiate receptors on nerves and inhibit release of
neurotransmitters involved with transmission of pain stimuli (such as Substance P).
Morphine also may inhibit release of some inflammatory mediators. The central
brain. Other opiates and opioids used in animals include hydromorphone, codeine,
oxymorphone, meperidine, and fentanyl. Oral morphine formulations are poorly
bioavailable in dogs and may not be effective.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Morphine is indicated for short-term analgesia, for sedation, and as an adjunct to
  id se  a   sa is   si i 'isas
multimodal approach to analgesia/anesthesia. Administration of morphine may
lower dose requirements for other anesthetics and analgesics used. Duration of
M
morphine in dogs is short (2-4 hours). Morphine has been used in animals for
treatment of pulmonary edema. Presumably, this effect is attributed to vasodilation
and reduction of preload in animals. Although oral morphine (regular and sustained
release) has been used in dogs, its absorption is poor and inconsistent. The oral dose
formulations should not be relied on for treating severe pain in dogs. Morphine oral
administration has not been investigated in cats. Injectable forms can be used in
cats, but doses are generally lower than in dogs to prevent excitement. In horses, it
is rarely used alone or without other sedatives because undesirable behavior and
cardiovascular effects may occur at doses that are needed for analgesia. The adverse
effects in horses diminish its routine use.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Like all opiates, side effects from morphine are predictable and unavoidable. Side
effects from morphine administration include sedation, vomiting, constipation,
winary retention, and bradycardia. Panting may occur in dogs as a result of
changes in thermoregulation. Histamine release occurs from administration of
morphine, but it may be less likely with other opioids. Excitement can occur in
some animals, but it is more common in cats and horses. Respiratory depression
occurs with high doses. As with other opiates, a slight decrease in heart rate
is expected. In most cases this decrease does not have to be treated with
anticholinergic drugs (e.g., atropine), but it should be monitored. Tolerance and
dependence occur with chronic administration. In horses, there was ileus,
constipation, and CNS stimulation (pawing and pacing) following 0.5 mg/kg.
In horses, undesirable and even dangerous behavior actions can follow rapid
preanesthetic of acepromazine or an alphaz-agonist.
524 Morphine Sulfate
Contraindications and Precautions
Morphine is a Schedule II controlled substance. Cats and horses are more
sensitive to excitement than other species.
Drug Interactions
Like other opiates, it will potentiate other drugs that cause CNS depression.
Instructions for Use
Effects from morphine administration are dose dependent. Low doses (0.1-
0.25 mg/kg) produce mild analgesia. Higher doses (up to l mg/kg) produce
greater analgesic effects and sedation. Usually morphine is administered IM, IV, or
SQ. Constant rate infusions (CRI) also have been used, and doses cited have been
shown to produce morphine concentrations in a therapeutic range. Oral morphine is
available in sustained-release forms, but oral dosing can be highly vaniable and
inconsistent. Epidural administration has been used for surgical procedures.
Combination protocols include MMK, which is morphine (0.2 mg/kg) +
medetomidine 60 mcg/kg (or dexmedetomidine) + ketamine (5 mg/kg) all mixed
in one syringe and administered IM to produce short-term analgesia and anesthesia
for approximately l20 minutes.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
 Monitor patient's heart rate and respiration. Although bradycardia rarely needs

administered. If serious respiratory depression occurs, the opioid can be reversed
with naloxone.
Formulations
Morphine is available in 1-, 2-,4-, 5-, 8-, 10-, 15-, 25-, and 50-mg/mL injection
(most common is 15 mg/mL); 15- and 30-mg tablets; and extended-release tablets
in 15, 30, 60, 100, and 200 mg (MS Contin, Oramorph SR, or generic brands).
Morphine pentahydrate (Avinza) is available in 60-mg capsules.
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature.
Morphine sulfate is slightly water soluble and soluble in ethanol. It is more stable at
pH <4. If mixed with high pH vehicles, oxidation occurs, which may darken the
fomulation (brownish yellow). Solutions may be repackaged in plastic syringes and
kept stable for 70 days. If mixed with sodium chloride (0.9%) for epidural injection,
it is stable for l4 weeks. Protect from freezing.
Small Animal Dosage

Moxidectin
moks-ih-dek'tin
Trade and other names: ProHeart (canine), Quest (equine), and Cydectin
(bovine and ovine)
Functional classification: Antiparasitic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antiparasitic drug in the milbemycin class. Avermectins (ivermectin-like drugs) and
milbemycins (milbemycin and moxidectin) are macrocyclic lactones and share
similarities, including mechanism of action. Compared to ivermectin, moxidectin is
glutamate-gated chloride ion channels in parasites. Paralysis and death of the parasite
are caused by increased permeability to chloride ions and hyperpolarization of nerve
cells. These drugs also potentiate other chlonide channels, including ones gated
by GABA, but GABA-mediated mechanism may not be important for parasites.
Mammals ordinarily are not affected because they lack glutamate-gated chloride
channels, and there is a lower affinity for other mammalian chloride channels.
Because these dnugs ordinarily do not penetrate the blood-brain barrier, GABA-
gated channels in the CNS of mammals are not affected. Moxidectin is active against
intestinal parasites, mites, bots, heartworm microfilaria, and developing larvae.
Moxidectin has no effect on trematode or cestode parasites. One of the equine

adult stages. In horses, moxidectin is used for treatment of a variety of parasites,
including large strongyles (Strongylus vulgaris [adults and L4/L5 arterial stages],
S. edentatus [adult and tissue stages], Triodontophorns brevicanda [adults], and T.
serratus [adults]); small strongyles {[adults] Cyathostomnm species, Cylicocycins
It is also used to treat small strongyles, including larvae. It is used to treat ascarids,
including Parascaris egwornm (adults and L4 larval stages), pinworms (Oxywris eqni
[adults and L4 larval stages ]), hairworms ( Trichostrongylus axei [adults ]), large-
mouth stomach worms (Habronemx mwscae [adults]), and horse stomach bots
(Gasterophilns intestinalis [2nd and 3rd instars] and G. nasalis [3rd instars]). One
dose also suppresses strongyle egg production for 84 days. Some formulations for
horses also contain praziquantel for horses. This increases the spectrum to include
other intestinal parasites such as tapeworms.
In cattle, moxidectin injectable is used to treat GI roundworms (Ostertogin
ostertagi [adults and inhibited fourth-stage larvae], Haemonchws placei [adults],

Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Toxicity is the result of potentiation of glutamate-gated chloride channels and
GABA channels resulting in hyperpolarization of membranes. Toxicity may
occur at high doses and in breeds in which moxidectin crosses the blood-brain
barrier. Sensitive breeds may include Collies, Australian shepherds, Old English
sheepdogs, longhaired Whippets, and Shetland sheepdogs. Toxicity is neurotoxic
and signs include depression, ataxia, diffculty with vision, coma, and death.
Sensitivity to moxidectin occurs in certain breeds because of a mutation in
the multidrug resistance gene (MDRI, also known as ABCBl gene) that codes
 dund xa su sae uon s adaad dund squ s r
the blood-brain barrier. Adverse effects may occur when high doses of
moxidectin are used to treat dogs for demodicosis. These effects include lethargy,
depressed appetite, vomiting, and lesions at the site of an SQ injection. Toxicity
is more likely at high doses in dogs. At five times the label dose rate (l5 mcg/
kg) once every month, moxidectin was administered safely to Collies that were
ivermectin sensitive. However, at a single dose of 90 mcg/kg (30 times the label
dose) administered to sensitive Collies, ataxia, lethargy, and salivation occurred in
one sixth of dogs. At 30, 60, and 90 mcg/kg to ivermectin-sensitive Collies (10
fimes, 20 times, and 30 times the label dose) there were no adverse effects
observed. Nevertheless, caution is advised when administering moxidectin to

sensitive breeds listed previously. Because of concern about adverse reactions and
product was temporarily discontinued. The safety concerns have been addressed
by refomulating the product, which is now available. In horses, moxidectin has
been safe at three times the label dose. However, adverse effects (ataxia,
depression, and lethargy) have been reported in young horses (younger than 6
months) or debilitated animals after treatment. Other adverse effects reported in
horses include sedation, weakness, bradycardia, dyspnea, coma, and seizures.

Moxifloxacin
moks-ih-floks'ah-sin
Trade and other names: Avelox
Functional classification: Antibacterial
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Fluoroquinolone antibacterial. Moxifloxacin, like other quinolones, inhibits DNA
gyrase and prevents bacterial cell DNA and RNA synthesis. Moxifloxacin is
bactericidal with broad antimicrobial activity. It has a chemical structure slightly
different from older veterinary fluoroquinolones (8 methoxy substitution). As a
result of this modification, this newer generation of drugs, such as moxifloxacin, has
Moxifloxacin529
greater activity against gram-positive bacteria and anaerobes than the veterinary
fluoroquinolones (enrofloxacin, orbifloxacin, danofloxacin, and marbofloxacin)
Indications and Clinical Uses
Moxifloxacin, although a human drug, has been used in small animals for treatment
of infections refractory to other drugs, including skin infections, pneumonia, and
soft tissue infections. The spectrum of activity includes gram-positive cocci and
anaerobic bacteria that may be resistant to other quinolones. Because other
veterinary fluoroquinolones are preferred for initial use (enrofloxacin, orbifloxacin,
danofloxacin, and marbofloxacin), moxifloxacin use is not common. Data for use in
small animals are sparse and regimens are primarily extrapolated from the human
label. In horses it has been administered at 5.8 mg/kg/day for 3 days. Although
pharmacokinetics were favorable in horses, it caused diarrhea that may present a risk.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
 High concentrations may cause CNS toxicity, especially in animals with renal
filure. Moxifloxacin causes occasional vomiting. All of the fluoroquinolones may

of age. Large, rapidly growing dogs are the most susceptible. In horses,
moxifloxacin at high doses caused diarrhea and is not recommended for routine
use. Moxifloxacin at high doses has caused a dose-related prolongation of the
QT interval. The clinical consequences of this observation for animals are not
known.
M
Contraindications and Precautions
Avoid use in young animals because of risk of cartilage injury. Use cautiously in
animals that may be prone to seizures. Avoid use in horses, rodents, and rabbits
because of risk of diarrhea.
Drug Interactions
Fluoroquinolones may increase concentrations of theophylline if used
concurrently. Coadministration with divalent and trivalent cations, such as
products containing aluminum (e.g., sucralfate), iron, and calcium, may decrease
absorption. Do not mix in solutions or in vials with aluminum, calcium, iron, or
zinc because chelation may occur.
Instructions for Use
 Doses are based on plasma concentrations needed to achieve sufficient plasma
concentration above minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) value. Efficacy
studies have not been performed in dogs or cats.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Susceptibility testing: CLSI break points for sensitive organisms are <l.0 mcg/mL.
Most sensitive gram-negative bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae have MIC values
≤0.l mcg/mL. If ciprofloxacin is used to treat Psendomonas, it may be several
times more active than other fluoroquinolones. Otherwise, one should assume

is longer (as long as 8 hours) for the metabolite.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Mycophenolate is used to treat immune-mediated diseases in animals.
 In dogs, mycophenolate has been used on a limited basis to treat some immune-
mediated diseases. According to pharmacokinetic studies with mycophenolate in
dogs, the elimination rate was rapid (half-life less than l hour), which may require
frequent dosing in dogs for successful therapy. For treatment of pemphigus
foliaceous, it was given at a dose of 22-39 mg/kg/day divided into three
treatments. It was well-tolerated, but only three out of eight dogs completed
the study and were improved. Azathioprine is more commonly used as an
immunosuppressive agent.

532 Naloxone Hydrochloride
Naloxone Hydrochloride
nal-oks'one hye-droe-klor'ide
Trade and other names: Narcan and Trexonil
Functional classification: Opioid antagonist
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Opiate antagonist. Naloxone competes for opiate receptors and displaces opioid
antagonizing all opiate receptors.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Naloxone is used to reverse the effects of opiate agonists on receptors. Naloxone
should be used to reverse overdoses or toxicity. It will reverse effects of morphine,
oxymorphone, butorphanol, hydromorphone, and other opioids. It is less effective
for reversing buprenorphine and may be titrated in gradually to achieve the
optimum amount of reversal. At very low doses {one fifth of the dose needed to
filly reverse opiates) it has been used to treat opioid-induced side effects such as
vomiting, nausea, and dysphoria. A formulation for wildlife use (Trexonil) is more
concentrated and used to reverse tranquilization in wild animals. Naloxone may have
disorders) but the effects are short-lived. For example, in horses, it will temporarily
decrease crib biting, but the duration of action is short.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Tachycardia and hypertension have been reported in people. In animals, reversal
of opioid may precipitate a severe reaction that includes high blood pressure,
excitement, pain, tachycardia, and cardiac arrhythmias.
Contraindications and Precautions
Administration to an animal that is experiencing pain will precipitate extreme
reactions because of blockade of endogenous opioids.
Drug Interactions
Naloxone will reverse the action of other opioid drugs.
Instructions for Use
Administration may have to be individualized based on response in each patient.
Naloxone's duration of action is short in animals (60 minutes) and it may have to
be readministered. Start at the low end of the dosage rate and increase the dose
to effect. Higher doses may be needed to reverse drugs that are mixed agonists/
antagonists such as butorphanol or buprenorphine, compared to reversing drugs
that are pure agonists. Low doses may be used to reduced opioid-induced
dysphoria in animals. For this use, start with 0.04 mg/mL solution and administer
increments of l mL every 30 seconds until vocalization or signs of dysphoria stop. A
dose of 0.0l mg/kg IV has been given for this purpose without losing analgesic
effects.
A dose of 1 mL (0.4 mg) will reverse 1.5 mg oxymorphone, 15 mg morphine,
100 mg meperidine, and 0.4 mg fentanyl.
Naltrexone 533
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Naloxone is used to reverse opioid analgesic drugs. When opioids are reversed in
some animals, serious reactions may occur. In some patients, changes in blood
pressure, tachycardia, and discomfort may result.
Formulations Available
Naloxone is available in injectable vials with preservatives in 0.4 or 1l mg/mL,
without preservatives in 0.02 mg (20 mcg), 0.4 mg or 1 mg per mL, and as
Trexonil in 50 mg/mL
Stability and Storage
When used IV, it may be diluted in other fluids. For intravenous infusion, it may be
added to sodium chloride or 5% dextrose. After dilution it should be used within 24
hours. Do not mix with other drugs or solutions that are alkaline. Store in a tightly
sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature.
Small Animal Dosage
Dogs and Cats
· 0.01-0.04 mg/kg IV, IM, or SQ, as needed to reverse opiate.

seconds (0.04 mg/mL solution) as needed.
Large Animal Dosage
Horses
·0.02-0.04 mg/kg IV (duration of effect is only 20 minutes).
Regulatory Information
No withdrawal times are established. It is anticipated that naloxone is cleared rapidly
after administration. Because of low risk of residues, short (24-48 hour) withdrawal
times are suggested.
RCI Classification: 3
Naltrexone
nal-treks'one
Trade and other names: Trexan, Vivitro
Functional classification: Opioid antagonist
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Opiate antagonist. Naltrexone competes for opiate receptors and displaces opioid
all opiate receptors. Its action is similar to naloxone except that it is longer-acting
and administered orally. A related drug that does not have central-acting effects is
methylnaltrexone (used to treat intestinal ileus). For humans, there is a long-acting
injection formulated in microspheres that persists for l month after a single
injection. The long-acting form has not been used in animals.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Naltrexone is used in people for treatment of opiate dependence and alcoholism.
In animals some obsessive-compulsive disorders are believed to be mediated by
534 Naltrexone
endogenous opioids. It has been used successfully for treatment of some
obsessive-compulsive behavioral disorders, such as tail chasing in dogs, acral lick
granuloma in dogs, and crib biting in horses. The effect for each of these disorders
is short-lived.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects have not been reported in animals. In people, it can precipitate
opioid withdrawal signs.
Contraindications and Precautions
 Do not administer to animals in pain, or it may elicit a severe reaction.
Drug Interactions
Naltrexone will reverse the action of other opioid drugs
Instructions for Use
For acute treatment of opiate toxicity, use naloxone instead because it can be
injected with a more rapid onset of effects. Treatment for obsessive-compulsive
disorders (canine compulsive disorder) in animals has been reported with naltrexone.
Relapse rates may be high.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor heart rate in treated animals.
Formulations
Naltrexone is available in 50 mg tablets. Vivitrol for humans is an encapsulated
 microsphere that can be injected to produce a long-lasting effect (one injection per
month) to treat substance dependence. One vial contains 380 mg in microspheres in
a 4 mL injection for IM use.
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature.
Naltrexone is soluble in water. It has been mixed with juices and syrups to mask the
bitter taste and was stable for 60-90 days.
Small Animal Dosage
Dogs
· For behavior problems: 2.2 mg/kg ql2h PO.
Large Animal Dosage
Horses
· Crib biting: 0.04 mg/kg IV or SQ. (Because injectable formulations are not

Naproxen
nah-proks'en
Trade and other names: Naprosyn, Naxen, and Aleve (naproxen sodium)
Functional classification: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Naproxen and other NSAIDs have produced analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects
by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins. The enzyme inhibited by NSAIDs is
the cyclo-oxygenase enzyme (COX). The COX enzyme exists in two isoforms:
important for maintaining a healthy GI tract, renal function, platelet function,
and other normal functions. COX-2 is induced and responsible for synthesizing
prostaglandins that are important mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever.
However, there are overlapping functions of the mediators derived from these
isoforms. Naproxen is a nonselective inhibitor of COX-l and COX-2.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Naproxen is approved for use in people and is popular for treating osteoarthritis
It has been used for treatment of musculoskeletal problems, such as myositis and
osteoarthritis in dogs and horses. There are no veterinary fomulations marketed.
Its use has diminished because there are registered drugs approved for these
indications for horses and dogs.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Naproxen is a potent NSAID. Adverse effects attributed to GI toxicity are
saop ul uogeiaoin snouas paonpod sey uaxoden 'saivsn ie oi uom
because elimination in dogs is many times slower than in people or horses. Renal
injury caused by renal ischemia also is possible with repeated doses.
Contraindications and Precautions
Caution is advised when using the OTC formulation designed for people because
the tablet size is much larger than the safe dose for dogs. Therefore, warn pet
 owners about administration to dogs without consulting a veterinarian frst.
Dosing rates for people are not appropriate for dogs. Do not administer to
animals prone to GI ulcers. Do not administer with other ulcerogenic drugs,
such as corticosteroids.
Drug Interactions
Do not administer with other NSAIDs or with corticosteroids. Corticosteroids
have been shown to exacerbate the GI adverse effects. Some NSAIDs may
interfere with the action of diuretic drugs and angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE) inhibitors

Trade and other names: Buscopan
Functional classification: Antispasmodic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antispasmotic, antimuscarinic, anticholinergic drug. This is a quarternary ammonium
compound derived from belladonna alkaloid. Butylscopolamine, like other
antimuscarinic drugs, blocks cholinergic receptors and produces a parasympatholytic
effect. It affects receptors throughout the body, but it is used more commonly for
its GI effects. It effectively inhibits secretions and motility of the GI tract by
blocking parasympathetic receptors. It has a short halflife (15-25 minutes) and
short duration of action.
Indications and Clinical Uses
spasmodic colic, flatulent colic, and intestinal impactions in horses. It is also used

Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse reactions from anticholinergic drugs are related to their blocking of
expected with this class of drugs, animals will have increased heart rate, decreased
secretions, dry mucous membranes, decreased GI tract motility, and dilated
pupils. In target animal safety studies in which doses of 1, 3 and 5 times the
approved dose and up to 10 times the dose were administered to horses, the
clinical signs described previously were observed. However, at high doses there
were no CBC or biochemical abnormalities or lesions identifed at necropsy.
Contraindications and Precautions
N-butylscopolammonium bromide will decrease intestinal motility. Use cautiously
in conditions where decreased motility will be a concern.
Drug Interactions
N-butylscopolammonium bromide is an anticholinergic drug and therefore will
antagonize any other medications that are intended to produce a cholinergic
response (e.g., metoclopramide).
Instructions for Use
Experience is limited to treating spasmodic colic, flatulent colic, and intestinal
impactions in horses. There is no experience in other animals.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests

synthesis via binding to 30S ribosome. It is bactericidal with a broad spectrum of
activity except against streptococci and anaerobic bacteria. Neomycin differs from
other aminoglycosides because it is only administered topically or orally. Systemic
absorption is minimal from oral absorption.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Neomycin is only available in topical formulations. It is often combined with other
infections. It is also used locally (oral local) for treatment of intestinal infections
(colibacillosis). It is given orally and, because it is not absorbed systemically, it
produces a local effect.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Although oral absorption is so small that systemic adverse effects are unlikely,
Alterations in intestinal bacterial flora from therapy may cause diarrhea.
Contraindications and Precautions
Use cautiously in animals with renal disease. If oral absorption occurs because of
compromised mucosal integrity, oral absorption may occur. Do not use longer
than l4 days. Neomycin has been mixed with water and injected, but this
practice is strongly discouraged.
Drug Interactions
N
Neomycin should not be mixed with other drugs before administration. Other
drugs may bind and become inactivated.
Instructions for Use
Efficacy for treatment of diarrhea, especially for nonspecific diarrhea, is questionable.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests

such as the retention observed in postoperative patients-by increasing the tone of
bladder smooth muscle. In ruminants, it has been used to stimulate rumen and
intestinal motility.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects are caused by the cholinergic action resulting from inhibition of
cholinesterase. These effects can be seen in the GI tract as diarrhea and increased
secretions. Other adverse effects can include miosis, bradycardia, muscle twitching
Or weakness, and constriction of bronchi and ureters. Adverse effects can be
treated with anticholinergic drugs such as atropine. Pyridostigmine may be
associated with fewer adverse effects than neostigmine.
Contraindications and Precautions
bronchoconstriction, pneumonia, and cardiac arrhythmias. Do not use in patients
sensitive to bromide. Consider the amount of bromide in dose in any patient also
receiving bromide (KBr) for treatment of seizures.
Drug Interactions
Do not use with other cholinergic drugs. Anticholinergic drugs (atropine and
glycopyrrolate) will block the effects.

Calcium-channel blocking drug of the dihydropyridine class. Vasodilator. The action
of nifedipine is similar to other calcium-channel blocking drugs, such as amlodipine.
  s  as s  a i n  rs
dihydropyridine class are more specific for vascular smooth muscle than the cardiac
tissue. Therefore, they have less effect on cardiac conduction than diltiazem.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Nifedipine is used for smooth muscle relaxation and to induce vasodilation. It is
indicated for treatment of systemic hypertension. Use in animals is rare because
there is more experience with amlodipine. The use of nifedipine in animals has been
primarily derived from empinical use. There are no well-controlled clinical studies or
efficacy tnials to document clinical effectiveness.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects have not been reported in veterinary medicine. The most
common side effect is hypotension.
N
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not administer to a patient with hypotension. Nifedipine may be teratogenic
in pregnant laboratory animals and/or embryotoxic. Avoid use in pregnant
animals.
Drug Interactions
Do not administer with drugs known to inhibit drug metabolizing enzymes (e.g,
ketoconazole). Nifedipine may be subject to interactions from drugs that inhibit
the membrane multidrug resistance (MDRl) pump (p-glycoprotein), which may
Instructions for Use
Use of nifedipine is limited in veterinary medicine. Other calcium-channel blockers,
such as diltiazem, are used to control heart rhythm. Amlodipine is more commonly
used for control of systemic hypertension.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests

preparation)
Functional classification: Antiprotozoal
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antiprotozoal drug. Nitazoxanide (NTZ) is a nitrothiazolyl-salicylamide derivative.
 Its action against protozoa is unknown, but it may be related to the inhibition of
the pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) enzyme-dependent electron transfer
reaction essential to anaerobic and protozoal energy metabolism. Activity has been
demonstrated against a variety of protozoa, including Cryptosporidium parvum,
Giardin, Isospora, and Enta moeba. It also has activity against intestinal helminths,
such as Ascaris, Ancylostomn, Trichnris, and Taenia. It also may be active against
some anaerobic bacteria, including Helicobacter. One of the active metabolites is
tizoxanide.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Nitazoxanide (NTZ) is used to treat equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM). It
has had only limited use in other veterinary species, but there is a form approved for
use in people for treatment of protozoal infections, such as C. porvnm and Giardio.

548 Nitroglycerin
Nitroglycerin
nye-troe-glih'ser-in
Trade and other names: Nitrol, Nitro-bid, and Nitrostat
Functional classification: Vasodilator
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Nitrate. Nitrovasodilator. Like other nitrovasodilators, it relaxes vascular smooth
muscle (especially venous) via generation of nitric oxide. Nitric oxide stimulates
guanylate cyclase to produce cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP) in vascular
smooth muscle and relax smooth muscle. Nitric oxide-generating compounds may
also help decrease gastric adverse effects associated with nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
Indications and Clinical Uses
Nitroglycerin, like other nitrovasodilators, is used primarily in heart failure or
pulmonary edema to reduce preload or decrease pulmonary hypertension. Use in
animals has been primarily derived from empirical use and experience in humans.
There are no well-controlled clinical studies or efficacy trials to document clinical
effectiveness. In people, they are used to treat angina pectoris. In horses,
nitroglycerin has been used to improve blood flow to the feet in the management of
laminitis. However, in experiments, this treatment was not effective in horses and
did not increase blood flow to the feet.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
The most significant adverse effect is hypotension. Methemoglobinemia can
occur with accumulation of nitnites, but it is a rare problem. Tolerance can
develop with repeated use. Because of tolerance it is advised to use the drug
intermittently.

Indications and Clinical Uses
Norfloxacin has been replaced by other veterinary fluoroquinolones because they
it has been used to treat a variety of infections, including respiratory, urinary tract,
skin, and soft tissue infections.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
High concentrations may cause CNS toxicity, especially in animals with renal
failure. Norfloxacin may cause some nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea at high doses.
All of the fluoroquinolones may cause arthropathy in young animals. Dogs are
most sensitive at 4 to 28 weeks of age. Large, rapidly growing dogs are the most
susceptible.
Contraindications and Precautions
Avoid use in young animals because of risk of cartilage injury. Use cautiously in
animals that may be prone to seizures. Norfloxacin may increase concentrations
of theophylline if used concurrently. Coadministration with divalent and tnivalent
cations, such as products containing aluminum (e.g., sucralfate), may decrease

5540lsalazine Sodium
Olsalazine Sodium
ole-sal'ah-zeen soe^dee-um
Trade and other names: Dipentum
Functional classification: Antidiarrheal
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Anti-inflammatory dnug composed of two molecules of aminosalicylic acid joined by
an azo bond. Each component is released in the colon by bacterial enzymes. The
released drug is also known as mesalamine (see separate entry for Mesalamine).
Mesalamine is also the active component of sulfasalazine, which is commonly
administered for treatment of colitis. The action of mesalamine is not precisely
known, but it appears to suppress the metabolism of arachidonic acid in the intestine.
It inhibits both cyclo-oxygenase- and lipoxygenase-mediated mucosal inflammation.
Systemic absorption is small; most of the action is believed to be local. Olsalazine has
a similar effect as sulfasalazine but without the sulfonamide component. Other
formulations of mesalamine include Asacol, Mesasal, and Pentasa. The others are
coated tablets designed to release the active component in the intestine.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Olsalazine, like other forms of mesalamine, is used for treatment of inflammatory
bowel disease, including colitis in animals. In small animals, most often sulfasalazine
is used; however, in some animals olsalazine may be indicated. Use in animals has
been primarily derived from empirical use and experience in humans. There are no
well-controlled clinical studies or efficacy trials to document clinical effectiveness.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
No adverse effects reported in animals.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not administer to patients sensitive to salicylate compounds.
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions have been reported for animals.
Instructions for Use
Olsalazine is used in patients that cannot tolerate sulfasalazine.

oh-mep'rah-zole
Trade and other names: Prilosec (formerly Losec; human preparation),
GastroGard, and UlcerGard (equine preparations)
Functional classification: Antiulcer agent
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Omeprazole inhibits gastric acid secretion by inhibiting
the Kt /H* pump (potassium pump). Omeprazole is more potent and longer acting
act via similar mechanism and are equally effective. PPIs also have some effect for
inhibiting Helicobacter organisms in the stomach when administered with antibiotics.
Omeprazole is decomposed in the acid environment of the stomach. Oral absorption is
decreased if administered with food. Formulations are designed to protect from acid to
improve oral absorption (e.g., some capsules contain bicarbonate) and should not be
modified (i.e., crushing of capsules) or the stability will be compromised.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Omeprazole, like other PPIs,is used for treatment and prevention of GI ulcers. It has
been used in dogs, cats, and exotic species, but most efficacy data for animals have
been produced in horses, in which it has been shown that omeprazole is effective
for treating and preventing gastric ulcers. In foals, 4 mg/kg q24h suppressed acid
secretion for 22 hours (by comparison, ranitidine suppressed acid up to 8 hours at a

(l mg/kg) and famotidine (0.5 mg/kg ql2h) for maintaining stomach pH >3-4.
Repeated doses may be necessary (2-5 doses) for complete inhibition of acid secretion.
Because of the long duration of effect, PPIs may be more effective than other drugs
(e.g.,histamine H blockers). In studies performed in horses, omeprazole was more
effective than ranitidine for treating gastric ulcers. Efects were observed within 14
days, but recurrence was observed after treatment was discontinued. Omeprazole,
like other PPIs, may be effective for preventing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug
(NSAID)-induced ulcers. Omeprazole has been used in combination with other drugs
(antibiotics) for treatment of Helicoba cterinfections in animals.

Contraindications and Precautions
 One of the human formulations (Zegerid) is a packet to be mixed with water for
oral administration. This formulation contains xylitol, which can be toxic to dogs
if administered at high doses, or with other medications that contain xylitol. No
contraindications have been reported for animals.
Drug Interactions
PPIs may inhibit some drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP-450 enzymes). In
people metabolism of clopidogrel to the active metabolite has been a concern.
Omeprazole may also inhibit metabolism of other drugs. Because of stomach acid
suppression, do not administer with drugs that depend on stomach acid for
absorption (e.g., ketoconazole and itraconazole).
Instructions for Use
Omeprazole is the most common drug of this class used in animals. Other PPIs
include pantoprazole (Protonix), lansoprazole (Prevacid), and abeprazole (Aciphex).
No experience with these other products is reported for veterinary medicine. They
 are all considered equally effcacious. Pantoprazole and rabeprazole have the
advantage in that they are available as tablets that can be crushed, and pantoprazole
studied in horses but has produced low and inconsistent response. Because there are
no small animal formulations available, the human forms have been admimistered to
dogs and cats and the equine formulation has been diluted in oil to 40 mg/mL for
administration to small animals. Preliminary studies have shown that the equine
fomulation administered orally to dogs can be effcacious.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Omeprazole and PPIs are generally considered safe. No routine tests for monitoring
adverse effects are recommended.
Formulations

capsules with 1l00 mg sodium bicarbonate. Zegerid is also available either as 40 mg
 or 20 mg single-dose packets of powder for oral suspension with 1680 mg sodium
bicarbonate.
Stability and Storage
Omeprazole should be maintained in the manufacturer's original formulation
(capsules or paste) for optimum stability and effectiveness. It is stable at pH ll but
rapidly decomposes at pH <7.8. There are no small animal formulations available
and either the human formulation or equine fomulation has been administered to
small animals. The equine fomulation should be diluted (e.g., in oil) for small
animal use because it is very concentrated. It has been diluted to 40 mg/mL by
suspending the approved equine oral paste formulation in sesame oil at a ratio of
1:9 and stored at controlled cold temperature (7"C) and protected from light.
However, the stability of extemporaneously prepared mixtures has not been
evaluated. Intravenous forms of omeprazole have been formulated in sterile water

Trade and other names: Zofran
Functional classification: Antiemetic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antiemetic drug from the class of drugs called serotonin antagonists. Like other drugs
used primarily as an antiemetic during chemotherapy, for which it has been effective
by blocking emetic stimuli that release serotonin. During chemotherapy, or following
GI injury, there may be 5-HT released from the GI tract that stimulates vomiting
centrally. This stimulus is blocked by this class of drugs. These drugs also have been
used to treat vomiting from other foms of gastroenteritis, pancreatitis, and
inflammatory bowel disease. Serotonin antagonists used for antiemetic therapy include
granisetron, ondansetron, dolasetron, azasetron, and tropisetron.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Ondansetron, like other serotonin antagonists, is used to prevent vomiting. Although
it may be effective for treating nausea and vomiting from other sources, the most
common use is for preventing vomiting from chemotherapy. There is only limited
efficacy information available for ondansetron effectiveness in animals. Oncologists
have found it to be effective for managing vomiting from chemotherapy in animals.

Orbifloxacin559
spectrum of activity. Spectrum includes staphylococci, gram-negative bacilli, and
some Psendomonas species. In dogs the half-life is 5.6 hours; in cats the half-life is
5.5 hours. In both species the oral absorption is nearly l00%. However, oral
below). In horses, it has a half-life of 5 hours and oral absorption of 68%.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Orbifloxacin is registered for use in dogs and cats. Like other fluoroquinolones, itis used
to treat susceptible bacteria in a variety of species. Treatment ofinfections has included
skin, soft tissue, and U'TIs in dogs and cats and soft tissue infections in horses.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
High concentrations may cause CNS toxicity, especially in animals with renal
failure. It may cause some nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea at high doses. All of
the fluoroquinolones may cause arthropathy in young animals. Dogs are most
sensitive at 4 to 28 weeks of age. Large, rapidly growing dogs are the most
susceptible. Blindness in cats has been reported from administration of some
quinolones (nalidixic acid and enrofloxacin), but at doses up to 15 mg/kg
(higher than approved label dose) orbifloxacin has not produced this effect.
Contraindications and Precautions
Avoid use in young animals because of risk of cartilage injury. Use cautiously in
animals that may be prone to seizures.
Drug Interactions
Fluoroquinolones may increase concentrations of theophylline if used
concurently. Coadministration with divalent and trivalent cations, such as
products containing aluminum (e.g., sucralfate), iron, and calcium, may decrease
absorption. Do not mix in solutions or in vials with aluminum, calcium, iron, or
zinc because chelation may occur.
Instructions for Use
At the registered label dose, orbifloxacin is active against most susceptible bacteria.
Within the approved dose range, higher doses are needed for organisms with higher
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values. In the cat, orifloxacin oral
suspension and orbifloxacin tablets are not bioequivalent. On a mg/kg basis,
orbifloxacin oral suspension provides lower and more variable plasma levels of
orbifloxacin than the tablets. The dose of orbifloxacin oral suspension in the cat is
7.5 mg/kg of body weight administered once daily, but tablet dose can be lower.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Susceptibility testing: CLSI break point for sensitive organisms is ≤l mcg/mL.
Other fluoroquinolones may be used in some cases to estimate susceptibility to this
fluoroquinolone. However, other drugs may have lower MIC values for Psendomonas
Formulations
Orbifloxacin is available in 5.7-, 22.7-, and 68-mg tablets. Oral suspension is

Ormetoprim + Sulfadimethoxine
or-met'oe-prim + sul-fa-dye-meth-oks'een
Trade and other names: Primor
Functional classification: Antibacterial
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antibacterial drug. Ometoprim sulfadimethoxine is a synergistic combination
similar to trimethoprim sulfonamide combinations. Ormetoprim inhibits bacterial
dhydrofolate reductase, and sulfonamide competes with para-aminobenzoic acid
(PABA) for synthesis of nucleic acids. Bactenicidal/bacteniostatic. It has a broad
antibacterial spectrum that includes common gram-positive and gram-negative
bacteria. It also is active against some coccidia.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Ormetoprim + sulfadimethoxine is used in small animals to treat a variety of bacterial
 infections caused by susceptible organisms, including pneumonia, skin, soft tissue, and
UTIs in dogs and cats. In horses, it may be administered orally for infections caused by
susceptible gram-positive bacteria ( Actinomyces, Streptococcus spp., and Staphylococcns
SPp.), but higher doses may be needed for gram-negative infections.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with sulfonamides include allergic reactions, Type II
hypothyroidism (with prolonged therapy), keratoconjunctivitis sicca, and skin
reactions. Dogs may be more sensitive to sulfonamides than other animals
because dogs lack the ability to acetylate sulfonamides to metabolites. Other,
more toxic metabolites may persist. Ormetoprim has been associated with some
CNS effects in dogs, which include behavioral changes, anxiety, muscle tremors,
and seizures. In horses when IV doses were administered to experimental horses
(IV formulation not commercially available), nervous system reactions such as
tremors and muscle fasciculations were observed.
Oxacillin Sodium 561
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not administer to animals sensitive to sulfonamides.
Drug Interactions
Sulfonamides may interact with other drugs, including warfarin, methenamine,
 and etodolac. They may potentiate adverse effects caused by methotrexate and
 pyrimethamine.
Instructions for Use
Doses listed are based on manufacturer's recommendations. Controlled trials have
demonstrated efficacy for treatment of pyoderma on a once-daily schedule.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor tear production with long-term use. For susceptibility testing, break point
ranges have not been determined for ormetoprim + sulfadimethoxine. Use a test
for trimethoprim-sulfonamide as a guide for susceptibility to ormetoprim +
sulfadimethoxine. CLSI break point for susceptible organisms is <2/38 mcg/mL
(trimethoprim/sulfonamide).
Formulations

Oxacillin Sodium
oks-ah-sill'in soe'dee-um
Trade and other names: Pro-staphlin and generic brands
Functional classification: Antibacterial
562Oxacillin Sodium
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Beta-lactam antibiotic. Oxacillin, like other beta-lactam antibiotics, binds penicillin-
binding proteins (PBP) that weaken or interfere with cell wall formation. After
binding to PBP, the cell wall weakens or undergoes lysis. Like other beta-lactams,
this drug acts in a time-dependent manner (i.e., it is more effective when drug
concentrations are maintained above the minimum inhibitory concentrations
[MIC] during the dose interval). Oxacillin has a limited spectrum of activity that
includes primarily gram-positive bacteria. Resistance is common, especially among
       - s
pharmacokinetic data are available for animals. Because of a short half-life and low
oral absorption, there are limitations to its use in animals.
Oxacillin is not valuable therapeutically but is used as a marker to test for
mec-A-mediated resistance of PBP2a in Staphylococcns. Methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus (e.g., MRSA or MRSP) are usually identified by using oxacillin break
points (see Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests section).
Indications and Clinical Uses
Oxacillin has been used in small animals for treating soft tissue infections caused by
gram-positive bacteria. The most common use has been for pyoderma in dogs. Use
has diminished because of limited pharmacokinetic information to guide oral dosing
and the increased availability of other drugs, such as oral cephalosporins and
amoxicillin-clavulanate.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects of penicillin-like drugs are most commonly caused by drug
allergy. This can range from acute anaphylaxis when administered or other signs
of allergic reaction when other routes are used. When administered orally,
diarrhea is possible, especially with high doses.
Contraindications and Precautions
 Use cautiously in animals allergic to penicillin-like drugs.
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions are reported. Food may inhibit oral absorption.
Instructions for Use
Doses are based on empiricism or extrapolation from human studies. No clinical
efficacy studies are available for dogs or cats. Administer, if possible, on empty
stomach.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Culture and sensitivity testing: CLSI break points to define mec-A-mediated
resistance in Staphylococcns awreus is a MIC ≥4 mcg/mL, and the zone size is
<10 mm. All other Staphylococcns spp. with mec-A-mediated resistance, including S.
psendintermedius (e.g., MRSP), are disk diffusion ≤17 mm and MIC ≥0.5 mcg/mL.
If staphylococi are resistant to oxacillin, they should be interpreted as being
resistant to all cephalosporins and penicillins regardless of sensitivity result. Oxacillin
resistance is usually interpreted as equivalent to methicillin resistance; therefore
oxacillin-resistant staphylococci are also referred to as methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcns anrens(MRSA)or Staphylococcns psendintermedius(MRSP).

Oxazepam
oks-ay/zeh-pam
Trade and other names: Serax
Functional classification: Anticonvulsant
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Benzodiazepine. Oxazepam is a central-acting CNS depressant with action similar
to diazepam. Its mechanism of action appears to be via potentiation of GABA-
receptor-mediated effects in the CNS. Oxazepam is one of the active products of
metabolism from diazepam. In contrast to diazepam, oxazepam does not undergo
extensive hepatic metabolism in animals, but it is glucuronidated before excretion.
In dogs, oxazepam has a half-life of 5-6 hours, but these values were derived from
administration of the parent drug diazepam. Oxazepam is eliminated by direct
conjugation with glucuronide, without other intermediate metabolites produced,
whereas diazepam and other benzodiazepines may produce other intermediate active
metabolites.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Oxazepam is used for sedation and to stimulate appetite. The appetite-stimulating
effects have been used, particularly in cats that may have diminished appetites caused
by other primary diseases. As a benzodiazepine it also may be considered for
behavior problems and anxiety disorders in animals, but it has not been used as
commonly as other drugs.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Sedation is the most common side effect. It may also produce polyphagia. Some
animals may experience paradoxical excitement. Chronic administration may lead
to dependence and a withdrawal syndrome if discontinued.
564 0xazepam
Contraindications and Precautions
Oral administration of another benzodiazepine—diazepam—has caused severe
idiosyncratic liver injury in cats. It is not known if the same concern applies to
from oxazepam have been reported.
Drug Interactions
Use cautiously with other drugs that may cause sedation.
Instructions for Use
Doses based on empiricism. There have been no clinical trials in veterinary medicine,
although it is widely believed to increase the appetite in cats.

Oxymetholone
oks-ih-meth'oh-lone
Trade and other names: Anadrol
Functional classification: Hormone, anabolic agent
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Anabolic steroid. Oxymetholone is a derivative of testosterone. Anabolic agents are
designed to maximize anabolic effects while minimizing androgenic action. Anabolic
agents have been used for reversing catabolic conditions, increasing weight gain,
increasing muscling in animals, and stimulating erythropoiesis. Other anabolic agents
include boldenone, nandrolone, stanozolol, and methyltestosterone.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Anabolic agents have been used for reversing catabolic conditions, increasing weight
gain, increasing muscling in animals, and stimulating erythropoiesis. Although other
anabolic agents have been used in animals (methyltestosterone and stanozolol)
there are no differences in efficacy among the anabolic steroids demonstrated in
animals.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects from anabolic steroids can be attributed to the pharmacologic
action of these steroids. Increased masculine effects are common. Increased
incidence of some tumors have been reported in people. The 17a-methylated
oral anabolic steroids (oxymetholone, stanozolol, and oxandrolone) have been
associated with hepatic toxicity.

Oxymorphone Hydrochloride
oks-ih-mor'fone hye-droe-kloride
Trade and other names: Numorphan
Functional classification: Analgesic, opioid
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Opioid agonist and analgesic. Action is similar to morphine, except that
oxymorphone is more lipophilic than morphine and 10 to 15 times more potent
than morphine. Action is to bind to mu-opiate and kappa-opiate receptors on nerves
and inhibit release of neurotransmitters involved with transmission of pain stimuli
(such as Substance P). Central sedative and euphoric effects related to mu-receptor
effects in brain. Other opiates used in animals include hydromorphone, codeine,
morphine, meperidine, and fentanyl. In dogs the half-life is 0.8 hours (IV) and 1
hour (SQ), with high clearance rates (>50 mL/kg/min). Effective concentrations
are not established for animals, but in people they range from 2.5 to 4.5 ng/mL.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Oxymorphone is indicated for short-term analgesia, for sedation, and as an adjunct
to anesthesia. It is compatible with most anesthetics and can be used as part of a
for dogs, other opiates are used more commonly such as hydromorphone and
morphine. Administration of oxymorphone may lower dose requirements for other
anesthetics and analgesics used. Duration of action in dogs is short (2-4 hours). The
oral dose fomulations are only l0% absorbed in people but should not be relied on
for treating severe pain in dogs.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Like all opiates, side effects from oxymorphone are predictable and unavoidable.
Side effects from opiate administration include sedation, vomiting, constipation,
urinary retention, and bradycardia. Panting may occur in dogs as a result of
changes in thermoregulation. Histamine release, known to occur from
administration of morphine, may be less likely with oxymorphone. Excitement
572 Oxymorphone Hydrochloride
can occur in some animals, but it is more common in cats and horses.
Respiratory depression occurs with high doses. As with other opiates, a slight
decrease in heart rate is expected. In most cases this decrease does not have to be
treated with anticholinergic drugs (e.g., atropine), but it should be monitored.
Tolerance and dependence occurs with chronic administration. In horses,
undesirable and even dangerous behavior actions can follow rapid intravenous
opioid administration. Horses should receive a preanesthetic of acepromazine or
an alpha2-agonist.
Contraindications and Precautions
Oxymorphone is a Schedule II controlled substance. Cats and horses may be
more sensitive to opiates.
Drug Interactions
Like other opiates, it will potentiate other drugs that cause CNS depression.
Instructions for Use
There is some evidence that oxymorphone may have fewer cardiovascular effects
compared to morphine. Because oxymorphone is more lipophilic than morphine,
it is readily absorbed from epidural injection. Oxymorphone may be used with
acepromazine and other sedatives; together they have synergistic effects.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor patient's heart rate and respiration. Although bradycardia rarely needs to be
treated when it is caused by an opioid, atropine can be administered if necessary. If
srious respiratory depression occurs, the opioid can be reversed with naloxone.
Formulations
Oxymorphone is available in 1.5- and l-mg/mL injection. Five- and 10-mg tablets
are available but have not been shown to be absorbed in animals.
Stability and Storage
The pH of solution is 2.7-4.5. Oxymorphone is compatible with most fluid
solutions. Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room
temperature.

Oxytetracycline  573
Oxytetracycline
oks'ih-tet-rah-sye'kleen
Trade and other names: Terramycin, Terramycin Soluble Powder, Terramycin
Scours Tablets, Biomycin, Oxy-Tet, and Oxybiotic Oxy 500 and Oxy 1000.
Long-acting formulations include Liquamycin-LA 200 and Biomycin 200.
Functional classification: Antibactenial
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Tetracycline antibiotic. Mechanism of action of tetracyclines is to bind to 30S
ribosomal subunit and inhibit protein synthesis. Oxytetracycline is usually
bacteriostatic. It has a broad spectrum of activity including gram-positive and
gram-negative bacteria, some protozoa, Rickettsiae, and Ehrlichiae. The spectrum
also includes Chlamydia, spirochetes, Mycoplasmn, L-form bacteria, and some
protozoa ( Plasmodium and Entameba). Resistance is common among gram-negative
bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae(e.g.,Escherichin coli).Oxytetracycline has been
available in a variety of formulations to control the release rate from an injection
Vehicles include polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, povidone, or pyrrolidine.
Although oral preparations are available, oral absorption is poor. For example, oral
absorption of 44 mg/kg in dogs was variable and too low to produce therapeutic
effects. In pigs oral absorption was only 4% (compared to chlortetracycline, which
 is 13%). Most pharmacokinetic studies have been performed with injectable
 i     i n    
with a maximum concentration (Cmax) of 5.6 mcg/mL. In horses, the half-life

4-6 hours.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Oxytetracycline is used to treat infections of the respiratory tract (pneumonia),
urinary tract, soft tissues, and dermis. It is used for infections caused by a wide
of entenic onigin and staphylococci. One of the most common uses is in cattle for
treatment of bovine respiratory disease (BRD) caused by Pastewrelln mnltocida,
Mannheimin haemoiytica,and Histophiius somni(formerly Haemophilns somnns).In
pigs, tetracyclines have been used to treat atrophic rhinitis, pneumonic pasteurellosis,
and Mycopiasma infections. In small animals, doxycycline, rather than
oxytetracycline, is used as a treatment for Rickettsiae and Ebrlichiae. In newborn
horses, oxytetracycline has been administered at high doses for the purpose of
correcting angular limb deformities. The doses have been as high as 50-70 mg/kg
IV q48h. There is no known explanation for the effect of oxytetracycline on tendon
or ligament laxity in horses.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Tetracyclines may cause renal tubular necrosis at high doses, but this is rare with
recommended doses. Tetracyclines can affect bone and teeth formation in young
animals. Tetracyclines have been implicated in drug fever in cats. Hepatoxicity
may occur at high doses in susceptible individuals. Oxytetracycline administration
to horses has been associated with colic and diarrhea
574 Oxytetracycline
Contraindications and Precautions
 Use cautiously in young animals because teeth discoloration is possible. Avoid
injection volumes for IM greater than 1o mL per site in cattle and greater than
5 mL in pigs.
Drug Interactions
Tetracyclines bind to compounds containing calcium, which decreases oral
absorption, Do not mix with solutions that contain iron, calcium, aluminum, or
magnesium.
Instructions for Use
Oral dose forms are for large animal use. Use of injectable long-acting forms have
not been studied in small animals. Use of tetracyclines in small animals has primarily
 relied on doxycycline. For large animals, there is both a conventional and long-
acting formulation. The long-acting formulation contains a viscosity excipient
used to prolong the absorption from the injection site. One such excipient is
apply to intramuscular use, not intravenous administration. When products that are
products usually allow for longer dose intervals. However, in pigs, there were no
differences in duration of plasma concentrations when equivalent doses were
administered.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Susceptibility testing: CLSI break point for sensitive cattle respiratory pathogens is
≤2 mcg/mL, and <0.5 mcg/mL for swine respiratory pathogens. For other
organisms the break point is ≤2 mcg/mL for streptococci and ≤4 for other
organisms. Tetracycline is used as a marker to test susceptibility for other drugs in
this class, such as doxycycline and minocycline.
Formulations
Oxytetracycline is available in 250-mg tablets; 500-mg bolus; 100- and 200-mg/mL
injection; and 25-, 166-, and 450-g/lb of powder. Long-acting formulations

Oxytocin
oks-ih-toe'sin
Trade and other names: Pitocin, Syntocinon (nasal solution), and generic
brands
Functional classification: Labor induction
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Oxytocin stimulates uterine muscle contraction via action on specific oxytocin
receptors. When administered around the time of luteolysis it stimulates PGF2-alpha
secretion and disrupts luteolysis. When administered prior to luteolysis, it does not
induce PGF2-alpha, and disrupts luteolysis and prolongs CL function.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Oxytocin is used to induce or maintain normal labor and delivery in pregnant
animals. In surgery it may be used postoperatively following cesarean section to
oxytocin is used to augment uterine contractions and stimulate lactation. It will
contract smooth muscle cells of the mammary gland for milk letdown if the udder is
in a proper physiological state. It is also used to expel the placenta after delivery.
However, efficacy for retained placenta is questionable, and some experts believe
that estrogen should be administered in addition to oxytocin. Oxytocin does not
increase milk production, but it will stimulate contraction leading to milk ejection.
Oxytocin administered prior to luteolysis (prior to day l0 post ovulation in horses)

578  Pamidronate Disodium
Pamidronate Disodium
pam-ih-droe'nate dye-soe'dee-um
Trade and Other Names: Aredia
Functional Classification: Antihypercalcemic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Bisphosphonate drug. Drugs in this class include pamidronate, etidronate,
fludronate, and pyrophosphate. These drugs are a group of drugs characterized
by a germinal bisphosphonate bond. They slow the formation and dissolution of
hydroxyapatite crystals. Their clinical use resides in their ability to inhibit bone
resorption. These drugs decrease bone tumover by inhibiting osteoclast activity,
inducing osteoclast apoptosis, retard bone resorption, and decrease rate of
osteoporosis. Inhibition of bone resorption is via inhibition of the mevalonate
pathway. Pamidronate, like other bisphosphonates, is not metabolized by the liver.
It is primarily eliminated by the kidneys in animals, and preferentially remains in
the bone for prolonged periods.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Pamidronate, like other bisphosphonate drugs, is used in people to treat
osteoporosis and treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy. In animals, pamidronate
is used to decrease calcium in conditions that cause hypercalcemia, such as cancer
and vitamin D toxicosis. It is helpful for managing neoplastic complications and
patients with pathologic bone disease and may reduce glucocorticoid-induced
osteoporosis. Experimental work performed in dogs has shown it to be effective for
 treating cholecalciferol toxicosis, but it did not prevent decreases in renal function.
  s ih si a ga  ar so u  y a 
weeks (median 8.5 weeks). Some bisphosphonates, such as pamidronate, have been
used to treat navicular disease in horses, but this work is only preliminary.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Fever, joint pain, and myalgias have been observed, but otherwise no serious
adverse effects have been identified. However, the use in animals has not been
common enough to identify a wider range of adverse effects. One study in dogs
reported a slight decrease in food intake. In humans, acute renal necrosis after
intravenous administration has been reported. Because pamidronate is eliminated
Jo ysu aun pue aiqissod st Ayedonydau suapusdap-asop e 'saop ul siaup aun Aq
renal injury is more likely with doses exceeding 3 mg/kg IV. In people, there is
some concern that the use of bisphosphonates produces excessive mineralization
and hardening of the bone, which may result in a greater risk of fractures.
However, this effect has not been reported for animals.
Contraindications and Precautions
Although SQ administration is listed in dose protocols, the IV route is preferred.
No contraindications have been identified in animals.
Drug Interactions
Do not mix with solutions containing calcium (e.g., lactated Ringer's solution).
Pancrelipase 579
Instructions for Use
For intravenous infusion, dilute in fluid solution (0.9% saline) and administer over 2
hours. (Dilute 30 mg pamidronate in 250 mL fluids.) Infusion can be repeated
every 7 days. Although the SQ route is listed for some veterinary applications, it is
not recommended and IV infision is the preferred route.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor serum calcium and phosphorus. Treatment of vitamin D toxicosis with
 pamidronate may result in decreased renal function. Monitor urea nitrogen,
creatinine, unine-specific gravity, and food intake in treated animals.
Formulations
Pamidronate is available in 30-, 60-, and 90-mg vials for injection and 1 mg/mL in
single-use vials for injection.
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature.

Pancrelipase
pan-kreh-lye'pase
Trade and Other Names: Viokase, Pancrezyme, Cotazym, Creon, Pancoate,
Pancrease, and Ultrase
Functional Classification: Pancreatic enzyme
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Pancreatic enzyme. Pancrelipase provides lipase, amylase, and protease. Pancrelipase
is a mixture of enzymes (lipase, amylase, and protease) obtained from the pancreas
580  Pancrelipase
of pigs. These enzymes enhance digestion of fats, proteins, and starches in the upper
duodenum and jejunum. They are more active in alkaline environment. There are
coated and uncoated tablets. The uncoated tablets are not as bioavailable because
degradation may occur in the acid of the stomach. Each milligram contains 24 units
lipase, 100 units amylase, and 100 units of protease activity.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Pancrelipase is used to treat pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. It provides enzymes
lacking for digestion. It should be administered before meals. It is inactivated in
gastric acid and should be administered with a drug to suppress stomach acid (e.g.
Hz-receptor blocker or proton pump inhibitor [PPI]) to improve activity.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Oral bleeding has been reported from administration of tablets. The tablets
contain potent enzymes and contact with mucosal membranes may cause lesions
and mucosal ulcers. Ensure that tablets are not trapped in the esophagus, or
esophageal erosions may occur. Wam owners that if they handle tablets, avoid
hand-to-mucosa contact (e.g., contact with eyes).
Contraindications and Precautions
Enteric-coated tablets may not be as effective as mixing powder with
food.
Drug Interactions
If antacids are used concurrently, magnesium hydroxide and calcium carbonate
may reduce effectiveness.
Instructions for Use
Mix pancrelipase with food when administering approximately 20 minutes prior to
feeding. After successfil results are obtained, the dose may be reduced gradually
to identify the minimum effective dose. Pancreatic enzymes are more effective if
administered with acid-suppressing drugs (H, blockers, PPIs, bicarbonate, or some
antacids). If delayed-release capsules are used (granules), do not crush. Different
brands have varying activity. If switching from one brand to another, not all
products will result in the same therapeutic results.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
No specific monitoring is necessary.
Formulations
Pancrelipase is available in a composition of l6,800 units of lipase, 70,000 units of
protease, and 70,000 units of amylase per 0.7 g. It is also available in capsules and
tablets. Various formulations contain a variety of activity. For example, Viokase
powder contains 16,000 units/70,000 units/70,000 units (lipase/protease/amylase)
per 0.7 g of powder. Tablets range from 8000/30,000/30,000 units (lipase/
protease/amylase) to 11,000/30,000/30,000 units (lipase/protease/amylase) per

Pancuronium Bromide
pan-kyoo-roe'nee-um bro'mide
Trade and Other Names: Pavulon
Functional Classification: Muscle relaxant
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Neuromuscular blocking agent (nondepolarizing). Pancuronium, like other drugs in
this class, competes with acetylcholine at the neuromuscular end plate to produce
paralysis. Sensory nerves are intact.
Indications and Clinical Uses
P
Pancuronium is a paralytic agent used during anesthesia or for mechanical
ventilation. It is used primarily during anesthesia or other conditions in which it is
necessary to inhibit muscle contractions. It is sometimes used as an alternative to
 atracunium because it is longer acting.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Pancuronium produces respiratory depression and paralysis. Neuromuscular
blocking drugs have no effect on analgesia.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not use in patients unless mechanical ventilation support can be provided.
Drug Interactions
 Some drugs may potentiate the action (e.g., aminoglycosides) and should not be
used concurrently.
Instructions for Use
Administer only in situations in which careful control of respiration is possible.
Doses may need to be individualized for optimum effect. Do not mix with
alkalinizing solutions or lactated Ringer's solution.

Pantoprazole
pan-toe-pray zole
Trade and Other Names: Protonix
Functional Classification: Antiulcer agent
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Pantoprazole inhibits gastric acid secretion by
inhibiting the Kt/H pump. Pantoprazole, like other PPIs, has potent and long-
acting effects. Acid suppression may have a duration >24 hours in animals. Other
PPIs that are administered orally (e.g., omeprazole) have been used in animals.
Pantoprazole is the first PPI that can be administered IV. After a dose, it inhibits
acid secretion for >24 hours.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Pantoprazole is used for treatment and prevention of GI ulcers. Other PPIs include
omeprazole, lansoprazole (Prevacid), and rabeprazole (AcipHex). All PPIs act via
a similar mechanism and are equally effective. However, there has been more
pantoprazole (l mg/kg) maintained stomach pH >3-4 when administered IV.
Pantoprazole, being the only one in an IV formulation, is often used when an
intravenous drug is preferred for treatment.
Pantoprazole 583
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Side effects have not been reported in animals. However, in people there is
concern about hypergastrinemia with chronic use. Overgrowth of Clostridiwm
bactenia has been a concern from chronic use because of chronic gastnic acid
suppression, but the clinical importance of this concern in animals has not been
established.
Contraindications and Precautions
No known contraindications.
Drug Interactions
Do not mix intravenous solution with other drugs. Do not administer with drugs
that depend on acid stomach for absorption (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole,
enzymes), although in people there was low risk of drug interactions caused by
enzyme inhibition.
Instructions for Use
tumors use higher dose (l mg/kg) twice daily. Other PPIs include omeprazole
(Prilosec), lansoprazole (Prevacid), and rabeprazole (AcipHex). They all act
via a similar mechanism and are equally effective. The primary difference with
 pantoprazole is that it is available in an intravenous dosage formulation and can be
mixed with fluid solutions. For intravenous use, mix a 40-mg vial with 10 mL saline
and further dilute with saline, lactated Ringer's solution, or 5% dextrose to 0.4 mg/
mL for intravenous infusion. Administer intravenous infusion over at least
15 minutes.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
P
 No specific monitoring is necessary. When treating ulcers, monitor hematocrit or
CBC to detect bleeding. Monitor for signs of vomiting and diarrhea.
Formulations
Pantoprazole is available in a 40-mg vial for intravenous use (diluted to 4 mg/mL)
and 20- and 40-mg delayed-release tablets. Threre are also granules for oral
administration in people.

Paromomycin Sulfate
pare-oe-moe-mye'sin sul' fate
Trade and Other Names: Humatin
Functional Classification: Antiparasitic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
P
Antibiotic drug of the aminoglycoside class. The mechanism of action of
paromomycin is similar to other aminoglycosides: It inhibits the ribosomal 30S
subunit with subsequent inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis. Spectrum of
activity is similar to other aminoglycosides. However, because paromomycin is
administered orally and generally not absorbed systemically, its activity is limited to
intestinal pathogens.
Indications and Clinical Uses
The use of paromomycin is limited to intestinal infections. It is not absorbed
systemically and should not be used for extraintestinal infections. Paromomycin has
been used to treat intestinal infections, such as cryptosporidiosis. The use is based
on limited accounts in animals and extrapolation from humans. Efficacy in animals
has not been tested in controlled studies.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Paromomycin has been associated with renal failure and blindness when used in
cats. Although systemic absorption is not expected to be high, cats treated with
high doses for intestinal organisms developed problems.
586   Paroxetine
Contraindications and Precautions
Extreme caution is recommended when administering this drug to animals that
may have a compromised bowel resulting from intestinal disease because
increased systemic absorption may occur.
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions have been reported in animals.
Instructions for Use
In cats, doses of 125-165 mg/kg every 12 hours have been administered for 5-7
days, PO. However, there are reports in the veterinary literature that these doses
have produced toxicity in cats, including renal injury. It is suggested to use lower
doses to avoid toxicity and monitor the patient's renal parameters carefully. When
there is a compromised integrity of the intestinal mucosa as may occur with
diarrhea, use of paromomycin is discouraged.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor patient's renal function, such as urine-specific gravity, serum creatinine, and
BUN, during treatment.
Formulations

Paroxetine
par-oks'eh-teen 
Trade and Other Names: Paxil
Functional Classification: Behavior modification
Paroxetine 587
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antidepressant drug. Paroxetine, like other drugs in this class, is classified as a
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). It resembles fluoxetine (Reconcile,
Prozac) in action. Its mechanism of action appears to be via selective inhibition of
serotonin reuptake and downregulation of 5-HT receptors. SSRI drugs are more
(TCAs).
Indications and Clinical Uses
Paroxetine, like other SSRI drugs, is used to treat behavioral disorders such as
compulsive disorders (canine compulsive disorder), anxiety, and dominance
aggression. In cats it has been effective for decreasing urine spraying.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Some effects similar to fluoxetine, but in some animals paroxetine is better
tolerated. Adverse effects observed in dogs and cats include constipation and
decreased appetite.
Contraindications and Precautions
 Use cautiously in patients with heart disease. Do not use in pregnant animals.
There is a risk of fetal malformations if used early in pregnancy.
Drug Interactions
Do not use with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), such as selegiline.
Do not use with other behavior-modifying drugs, such as other SSRIs
or TCAs.

Penicillamine
pen-ih-sill ah-meen
Trade and Other Names: Cuprimine and Depen
Functional Classification: Antidote
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Penicillamine is also called 3 mercaptovaline. It is a chelating agent for lead copper,
iron, and mercury. When used to treat copper toxicity, it helps to solubilize copper
in the cells to allow for more rapid urinary excretion. Treated animals should have
agents include tetrathiomolybdate, trientine, and zinc. Penicillamine also has
anti-inflammatory properties. It inhibits collagen cross-linking by making it more
susceptible to enzyme degradation. This antifbrotic property may contribute to its
 positive effect for treating animals with hepatitis.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Penicillamine has been used in people to treat rheumatoid arthritis. In animals it
is used primarily for treatment of copper toxicity and hepatitis associated with
disease may require 2-4 months. It also has been used to treat cystine calculi.
Although it may inhibit collagen and reduce fibrosis in patients with hepatic
disease, this effect has been disappointing in clinical patients. There is no clear
demonstration that it is efficacious for this indication.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
The most common effect is anorexia and vomiting. In people, allergic reactions,
cutaneous reactions, agranulocytosis, and anemia have been reported. It has also
produced proteinuria and hematuria and in cats has caused neutropenia. In dogs
treated for liver disease, corticosteroid-like hepatopathy has been observed.
Therefore it may produce steroid-like effects in the liver.

Penicillin G
?
Trade and Other Names: Penicillin G potassium or sodium, Penicillin G
benzathine (Benza-Pen), Penicillin G, Procaine, and generic Penicillin V
(Pen-Vee)
Functional Classification: Antibacternia
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Beta-lactam antibiotic. Penicillin G is also called benzyl penicillin. Its action is
similar to other penicillins. It binds penicilin-binding proteins (PBP) to weaken or
cause lysis of the cell wall. Penicillin G is bactericidal with a time-dependent action.
An increased bactericidal effect is observed when drug concentrations are maintained
above minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values. The spectrum of penicillin
G is limited to gram-positive bacteria, anaerobic bacteria, and a few highly
susceptible gram-negative bacteria (e.g., Pastewrella spp.). Practically all bacteria of
the Enteroba cteriacene and beta-lactamase-producing Staplrylococcus spp. are
resistant. Penicillin sodium or penicillin potassium when injected IV has a half-life
of 1 hour or less in most animals. However, the same dose of procaine penicillin
given IM may produce more prolonged concentrations and a half-life of 20-24
hours because of slow absorption from the injection site.
Fomulations of penicillin G are designed to control the absorption from site of
injection. Fomulations include:
590 Penicillin G
· Sodium or potassium penicillin G (crystallin penicillin), which is water soluble and
can be administered IV or IM. It may also be mixed with fluids for IV administration.
· Penicillin G benzathine, which is insoluble and available as a suspension. It is
slowly absorbed from an injection site to produce low but prolonged (several
days of) penicillin concentrations. All benzathine penicillin G forms are
combined with procaine penicillin G in commercial formulation (l :l ratio).
subcutaneous administration. It is absorbed slowly, producing concentrations
for 12-24 hours after injections
parison with other penicillin derivatives.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Penicillin G is administered by injection either IV (potassium or sodium penicillin)
or IM (procaine or procaine/benzathine penicillin G). Penicillin G is indicated for
winary tract infections. Many staphylococci are resistant because of beta-lactamase
synthesis. Streptococci are usually susceptible. Other susceptible organisms include
gram-positive bacilli and anaerobic bacteria. Most gram-negative bacilli, especially
those of enteric origin, are resistant. Some gram-negative respiratory pathogens such
as Pasteurella multocida andMannheimia haemolytica are susceptible.
Penicillin concentrations in the urine are at least l00-fold higher than plasma
concentrations in treated animals; therefore, some urinary pathogens may be more
susceptible.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Penicillin G is usually well tolerated. Allergic reactions are possible. Diarrhea is
common with oral doses. Pain and tissue reactions may occur with IM or SQ
injections. Formulations of procaine penicillin G contain varying amounts of free
procaine (depending on the fomulation). Free procaine in the formulation may
elicit a CNS reaction after injection in some horses. Large doses of sodium
penicillin IV can decrease potassium concentrations.
Contraindications and Precautions
Use cautiously in animals allergic to penicillin-like drugs. Avoid injection volumes
greater than 30 mL per site. Administration of the long-acting benzathine form
of penicillin G will increase the risk of residues in food-producing animals.
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions have been reported in animals.
Instructions for Use
The approved dose listed on the injectable product labels are outdated and do not
reflect the current clinical use of penicillin. Penicillin G benzathine is not
therapeutic drug concentrations. A possible exception is for treatment of
streptococcal infections. Avoid SQ injection with procaine penicillin G because of
tissue injury and food animal residue problems. Penicillin V should be administered
on an empty stomach for maximum absorption.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Susceptibility testing: CLSI break points for sensitive organisms are ≤8 mcg/mL for
enterococci and ≤0.12 mcg/mL for staphylococci and streptococci.

recommended. Procaine penicillin G is available in 300,000 units/mL suspension.
Penicillin is one of the few antibiotics that is still measured in tems of units rather
than weight in milligrams or micrograms. One unit of penicillin represents the
specific activity in 0.6 mcg of sodium penicillin. Thus, 1 mg of penicillin sodium

Pentastarch
Trade and Other Names: Pentaspan
Functional Classification: Fluid replacement
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Pentastarch is a synthetic colloid volume expander that is used to maintain vascular
volume in animals with circulatory shock. It is prepared from hydroxyethyl starch
hetastarch and pentastarch. Hetastarch (6%) has an average molecular weight of
450,000 and colloid osmotic pressure of 32.7. Pentastarch (10%) has an average
molecular weight of 280,000 and colloid osmotic pressure of 40. Because hetastarch
is a larger molecular weight compound than pentastarch, it tends to remain in
the vasculature and prevent loss of intravascular volume and tissue edema. After
administration, pentastarch will be retained in the vasculature and prevent loss of
intravascular volume and tissue edema. Other colloids used are dextrans {Dextran 40
and Dextran 70). Hetastarch and the dextrans are discussed in other sections.
Indications and Clinical Uses
administered IV in acute situations. Pentastarch has a duration of effective volume
expansion of 12-48 hours. Pentastarch is used in similar situations as hetastarch, but
it is used less frequently.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
There has only been limited use in veterinary medicine; therefore adverse
effects have not been reported. However, it may cause allergic reactions and
hyperosmotic renal dysfunction. Coagulopathies are possible but are rare and less
likely than with hetastarch.
Contraindications and Precautions
No contraindications are reported for animals.
Drug Interactions
Pentastarch is compatible with most fluid solutions.
Instructions for Use
Pentastarch is used in critical care situations and is infused via constant rate infusion
(CRI). Pentastarch may be more effective and produce fewer side effects than
Dextran. Because of lower molecular weight, it can be infused more quickly than
hetastarch.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor patient's hydration status and blood pressure during administration.

Pentazocine
 pen-taz'oh-seen
Trade and Other Names: Talwin-V
Functional Classification: Analgesic, opioid
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Synthetic opiate analgesic. The action of pentazocine results from its effect as a
mu-opiate receptor partial agonist and a kappa-receptor agonist. Most of the
sedative and analgesic effects are believed to be caused by the kappa-receptor effects.
Pentazocine may partially reverse some mu-receptor agonist effects. Its effects are
s   i     s   s
Indications and Clinical Uses
Pentazocine has been used for sedation and analgesia, primarily in horses. However
because of the availability of other opioids with better efficacy, the use of
pentazocine has declined.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects are similar to other opioid analgesic drugs and include
constipation, ileus, vomiting, and bradycardia. Sedation is common at analgesic
doses. Respiratory depression can occur with high doses. Dysphoric effects are
possible in some sensitive individuals and in some species (e.g., horses).
Contraindications and Precautions
Pentazocine is a Schedule IV controlled substance.
Drug Interactions
Pentazocine may potentiate other sedative drugs such as alphaz-agonists.
Pentazocine may interfere with mu-opiate effects of other drugs, such as
morphine or fentanyl
594 Pentobarbital Sodium
Instructions for Use
Pentazocine is a mixed agonist/antagonist. It is relatively modest to weak in efficacy
for pain control, and other opioids should be considered for better pain management.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor patient's heart rate and respiration. Although bradycardia rarely needs to be
 treated when it is caused by an opioid, atropine can be administered if necessary. If
senious respiratory depression occurs, the opioid can be reversed with naloxone.

Pentoxifylline
pen-toks'ih-fill-in
Trade and Other Names: Trental, Oxpentifylline, and generic brands
Functional Classification: Anti-inflammatory agent
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Methylxanthine. Pentoxifylline is used primarily as a rheological agent in people
(increases blood flow through narrow vessels). An improved rheological effect has
also been demonstrated with equine red blood cells but not neutrophils. As a
phosphodiesterase inhibitor (PDE 4 inhibitor) it produces anti-inflammatory
effects. It may have anti-inflammatory action via inhibition of cytokine synthesis.
Pentoxifylline suppresses synthesis of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1
(IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha and may inhibit
lymphocyte activation
 In horses the half-life is only 23 minutes and oral absorption has been 45% but
variable and inconsistent. Pentoxifylline undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism in
dogs, and systemic availability after oral administration is 50% but can be highly
variable and inconsistent. In other studies the oral absorption is only 20%-30% with
a short elimination half-life (less than l hour). Seven metabolites are produced in
animals, with some being biologically active.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Most of pentoxifylline's use in animals (including doses) is based on anecdotal
experience. Pentoxifylline is used in dogs for some dermatoses, vasculitis, contact
allergy, atopy, familial canine dermatomyositis, increased survival of skin flaps,
increased healing of radiation injury, and erythema multifome. In horses,
pentoxifylline is used for a variety of conditions in which suppression of inflammatory
cytokines or increased blood perfusion is desired. Such conditions have included
intestinal ischemia, colic, sepsis, laminitis, and navicular disease. However, the efficacy
for treating these diseases has not been shown. It may have improved effcacy for sepsis
f combined with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID; e.g., flunixin).
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Pentoxifylline may cause effects similar to other methylxanthines, such as nausea,
vomiting, and diarhea. Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and headache have been
reported in people. Vomiting is reported in dogs. Broken tablets taste unpleasant
when administered to cats. If crushed tablets are used, plasma concentration will
increase more rapidly than with intact tablets, leading to headaches, nausea, and
possible vomiting. In horses, IV doses have caused muscle fasiculations, increased
heart rate, and sweating.
Pentoxifylline  597
Contraindications and Precautions
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions are reported. However, as a methylxanthine, adverse
reactions are possible from coadministration with a cytochrome P450 inhibitor
(see Appendix).
Instructions for Use
Although pharmacokinetic studies in dogs and horses have been reported, results of
clinical studies in animals have been limited. Based on pharmacokinetic studies that
show a short half-life in dogs, higher doses than those listed in the dosing section
have been advocated. For example, the most effective dose may be as high as
every 12 hours, but a frequency of every 8 hours may be considered to get an
optimum response in some patients.

598 Pergolide, Pergolide Mesylate
Pergolide, Pergolide Mesylate
per'goe-lide
Trade and Other Names: Permax
Functional Classification: Dopamine agonist
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Dopaminergic agonist. Pergolide is a potent dopamine agonist that
stimulates postsynaptic dopamine receptors (D and D2 receptors). It is used to
stimulate dopamine receptors in conditions in which dopamine is deficient,
regardless of the state of the presynaptic dopamine stores. Other drugs that may
share similar effects are selegiline, apomorphine, and lisunide (previously called
lysuride). In horses the half-life is 5.9 hours and is rapidly absorbed from oral
administration.
Indications and Clinical Uses
In people, pergolide has been used for neurodegenerative disease in which
dopamine is deficient, such as Parkinson's disease, in which pergolide is used with
   q s d ao do  edo
humans and its use has diminished because of reports of cardiac valve damage
associated with pergolide. In animals it also has been used for dopamine-deficient
states. It is believed that horses and some dogs develop hyperadrenocorticism
(Cushing's disease)—pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism (PDH)—-because
of a loss of dopamine antagonism of adrenocorticotropic homone (ACTH) release.
In horses it is used successfully to treat pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction ( PPID
Or equine Cushing's syndrome) and has controlled the disease in horses for longer
than 2 years. Most horses with Cushing's disease have hyperplasia or adenoma of
the pars intermedia of the pituitary. This adenoma is deficient in dopamine and
normal states. The benefits of pergolide administration have not been established for
dogs. Because of adverse effects produced, pergolide is not used for treating PDH
indogs.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Pergolide was withdrawn from the human market because of evidence that drugs
that activate the 2b-serotonin receptor (5-HT2b) are associated with a distinct
form of fibrotic valvulopathy. These effects have not been observed in animals.
Pergolide inhibits secretion of prolactin and will increase growth hormone. It
may inhibit lactation. CNS effects may include ataxia and dyskinesia. In horses,
adverse effects include anorexia, diarrhea, and colic. Worsening of laminitis from
pergolide (it is theoretically a vasoconstrictive drug) has not been proved. In
dogs, at doses of l00 mcg/kg it produced significant reactions that included
vomiting, tremors, anorexia, restlessness, and diarrhea.
Contraindications and Precautions
Unlike bromocriptine, pergolide can be used in pregnant animals.
Pergolide, Pergolide Mesylate 599
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions have been reported in animals. It may interact with
droperidol and phenothiazines (e.g., acepromazine), and it will exacerbate the
effects of selegiline. Do not administer with monoamine oxidase inhibitors
(MAOIs).
Instructions for Use
Use in horses is often accomplished by compounding the preparation for
horses and administering daily. Start with the low dose listed for 4-6 weeks and
gradually increase the dose until desired results are obtained. It may be possible to
obtain better efficacy when pergolide is used concurrently with cyproheptadine.

Indications and Clinical Uses
Phenobarbital is widely used as a drug of choice for treating seizure disorders,
such as idiopathic epilepsy, in dogs, cats, horses, and exotic animals.
Phenobarbital also has been used as a sedative. Phenobarbital has been effective for
the treatment of sialadenosis in dogs caused by submandibular salivary gland
enlargement.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Most adverse effects are dose related. Phenobarbital causes polyphagia, sedation,
ataxia, and lethargy. Some tolerance develops to side effects after initial therapy.
Liver enzyme elevations, particularly alkaline phosphatase, are common but may
been reported in some dogs and is more likely with high doses. Neutropenia,
in dogs. These reactions are likely to be idiosyncratic and recovery may occur if
phenobarbital is discontinued. Combinations of phenobarbital and potassium
bromide have increased the risk of pancreatitis in dogs. In dogs, superficial
necrolytic dermatitis has been associated with phenobarbital administration
without concurrent liver pathology. Affected dogs may have high serum
concentrations of phenobarbital.
Contraindications and Precautions
Administer with caution to animals with liver disease. Phenobarbital may
induce its own metabolism, which shortens the half-life. Therefore, chronic
increase in dose may be necessary.
Phenobarbital, Phenobarbital Sodium  601
Drug Interactions
Phenobarbital is one of the most potent drugs for inducing hepatic microsomal
metabolizing enzymes. Therefore, many drugs administered concurently will
have lower (and perhaps subtherapeutic) concentrations because of more rapid
clearance. Drugs affected may include theophylline, digoxin, corticosteroids,
anesthetics, and many others {see Appendix for a list of drugs that affect
cytochrome P450 enzymes). Phenobarbital will shorten the half-life of
levetiracetam (Keppra) in dogs, which may require higher doses or more frequent
I4 thyroid concentrations, but thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and T3
concentrations are unaffected. Solutions are alkaline (pH 9-ll); therefore avoid
mixing with acidic solutions or drugs that will become unstable at alkaline pH.
Instructions for Use
Adjust dose based on blood levels of phenobarbital. If bromide is used concurrently
(sodium or potassium bromide) lower doses of phenobarbital may be used.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Phenobarbital doses should be carefully adjusted via monitoring serum/plasma
concentrations. Collect a sample at any time during the dose interval because the timing
be stored (these devices will cause a false lowering of concentrations). The therapeutic
range in dogs is considered 15-40 mcg/mL (65-180 mmol/L). If dogs are also
receiving bromide, phenobarbital concentrations in the range of 10-36 mcg/mL have
been considered therapeutic. To convert from mmol/L to mcg/mL use a
 4.3. In cats the optimum range for therapeutic effect is 23-28 mcg/mL
(99-120 mmol/L). In horses the optimum range for therapeutic effect is
15-20 mcg/mL (65-86 mmol/L). Monitor liver enzymes periodically in animals
P
receiving phenobarbital because of risk of hepatopathy. However, some liver enzyme
elevations may occur—especially with alkaline phosphatase—-without liver pathology.
Other liver tests may be needed to rule out hepatotoxicity. Liver enzymes usually return
 to baseline levels 1-5 weeks after discontinuing treatment. Phenobarbital can increase
serum triglycenides because of delayed clearance of chylomicrons from the blood and
decreased LPL activity. Monitor CBC periodically in animals treated with phenobarbital
because of risk of neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Phenobarbital
administration will lower other drug concentrations. Phenobarbital did not interfere
with the ACTH stimulation test or low-dose dexamethasone suppression test in dogs. It
will lower thyroid T4 and free T4 but not T3 and TSH concentrations in dogs.
Formulations
Phenobarbital is available in 15-, 30-, 60-, and 100-mg tablets; 30-, 60-, 65-, and
130-mg/mL injection; and 4-mg/mL oral elixir solution. Because of the bitter taste

RCI Classification: 3
Phenylbutazone 605
Phenylbutazone
fen-ill-byoo'tah-zone
Trade and Other Names: Butazolidin, PBZ, and generic brands
Functional Classification: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Phenylbutazone and other NSAIDs produce analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects
by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins. The enzyme inhibited by NSAIDs is
the cyclo-oxygenase enzyme (COX). The COX enzyme exists in two isoforms:
COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is primarily responsible for synthesis of prostaglandins
important for maintaining a healthy GI tract, renal fuinction, platelet function,
and other normal functions. COX-2 is induced and responsible for synthesizing
prostaglandins that are important mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever.
However, it is known that there is some crossover of COX-1 and COX-2 effects
in some situations, and COX-2 activity is important for some biological effects.
Phenylbutazone, using in vitro assays, is a nonselective inhibitor of COX-l and
COX-2. Phenylbutazone has a half-life of 36-65 days in cattle, 5 hours in horses,
and 4-6 hours in dogs.
Indications and Clinical Uses
The major use of phenylbutazone is in horses for musculoskeletal pain and
inflammation, arthritis, soft tissue injury, and racing injuries. It is approved in both
dogs and horses. The duration of action in horses after a single administration is
in Europe); however, the use in small animals is not common because of the
availability of other drugs.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
In horses, GI ulcers have been documented. Ulcers are more likely as the dose
increases and in animals undergoing extensive training. Phenylbutazone is
generally well tolerated in dogs, but there are no data for cats. In these animals,
adverse effects possible are GI toxicity such as gastritis and gastric ulcers.
Phenylbutazone is also associated with renal injury. In horses that are dehydrated
or have renal compromise, phenylbutazone can cause ischemia and renal papillary
necrosis. Phenylbutazone is rarely used in people because it has caused bone
marrow depression. This effect also has been observed in dogs. In experimental
horses, phenylbutazone (4.4 mg/kg ql2h for 14 days) decreased proteoglycan
synthesis in articular cartilage.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not administer injectable formulation IM. Do not administer to animals
prone to GI ulcers or with compromised renal finction. Do not administer with
other ulcerogenic drugs, such as corticosteroids.
Drug Interactions
The use with other NSAIDs or with corticosteroids should be done cautiously
because of the risk of GI injury. Corticosteroids have been shown to exacerbate
the GI adverse effects. Phenylbutazone has been used in some horses in
606   Phenylbutazone
combination with flunixin meglumine {NSAID “stacking"), but this combination
may increase risk of hypoalbuminemia and decreased total serum protein.
Phenylbutazone will interfere with the action of furosemide in horses. Some
NSAIDs also may interfere with the action of angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE) inhibitors.
Instructions for Use
Doses are based primarily on manufacturer's recommendations and clinical
experience. Although a range of 4.4-8.8 mg/kg per day has been administered
to horses, studies have not shown an advantage for the higher dose, and
the higher dose of 8.8 mg/kg per day is more likely to cause GI injury,
hypoalbuminemia, and neutropenia. Combining other NSAIDs with
phenylbutazone, such as flunixin (referred to as “stacking"), may improve response
when treating lameness and other musculoskeletal problems when compared to
phenylbutazone alone. However, this practice must be weighed against an increased
risk of GI injury.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor CBC for signs of bone marrow toxicity with chronic use.
Formulations
Phenylbutazone is available in 100-mg, 200-mg, 400-mg and 1-g tablets (bolus);
Stability and Storage
 Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature.
 Phenylbutazone is not water soluble. It should not be compounded in aqueous
vehicles.

fen-ill-proe-pah-nole'ah-meen hye-droe-klor'ide
Trade and Other Names: PPA, Proin-ppa, UniCon, and Propalin (veterinary
preparations)
Functional Classification: Adrenergic agonist
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Adrenergic agonist. Sympathomimetic. Phenylpropanolamine nonselectively
These receptors are found throughout the body, such as on sphincters, blood
vessels, smooth muscle, and heart. The most profound effects observed with
phenylpropanolamine are on vascular smooth muscle (vasoconstriction) and urethral
smooth muscle (increased tone of urethra). The half-life in dogs is 4-7 hours.
However, the duration of effect may be at least 8-12 hours and as long as 24 hours
in some animals. A longer interval of administration may prevent some down-
regulation of alpha receptors.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Phenylpropanolamine (PPA) has been used as a decongestant, as a mild
bronchodilator, and to increase tone of the urinary sphincter. Pseudoephedrine and
phedrine are related drugs that produce similar alpha-receptor and beta-receptor
effects. The most common use in animals is for treating urinary incontinence. The
mechanism for this action appears to be via stimulating receptors on the sphincter.
and adverse effects have limited the routine use as a decongestant and appetite
suppressant in human medicine. Most of the human preparations have been
removed from the market and the only forms readily available are those marketed
for veterinary medicine.
Phenylpropanolamine Hydrochloride 609
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects are attributed to excess stimulation of adrenergic (alpha and beta)
receptors. Side effects include tachycardia, cardiac effects, CNS excitement,
restlessness, and appetite suppression. There are reports of adverse effects caused
by PPA in people. In particular, it has caused problems with blood pressure and
increased risk of strokes. Such a concem should also apply to animals, but there
Contraindications and Precautions
Use cautiously in any animal with cardiovascular disease. PPA has been abused by
people and used as a recreational drug.
Drug Interactions
 PPA and other sympathomimetic drugs can cause increased vasoconstriction and
changes in heart rate. Use cautiously with other vasoactive drugs and alpha-2
agonists such as dexmedetomidine and xylazine. Use cautiously with other drugs
that may lower seizure threshold. Use of inhalant anesthetics with PPA may
increase cardiovascular risk. Do not use with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or
monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs; e.g., selegiline or amitraz).
Instructions for Use
Although frequency of administration has been every 8-12 hours in most cases,
there is evidence that an interval of every 24 hours in dogs at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg
is just as effective. In some animals, pseudoephedrine has been substituted for PPA
with good success.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor heart rate and blood pressure in animals receiving treatment. Animals with
uninary incontinence should be checked periodically for presence of UTIs.
Formulations
 Phenylpropanolamine is available in 25, 50, and 75 favored tablets; 25-mg vanilla-
flavored liquid, and 50-mg scored tablets (veterinary preparations). Human
formulations of 15-, 25-, 30-, and 50-mg tablets are no longer available, but

RCI Classification: 3
Phenytoin, Phenytoin Sodium
fen-ih-toe-in
Trade and Other Names: Dilantin
Functional Classification: Anticonvulsant, antiarrhythmic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Anticonvulsant. Depresses nerve conduction via blockade of sodium channels.
Phenytoin is also classified as a Class I cardiac antiarrhythmic. In cardiac tissue,
phenytoin increases the threshold for triggering ventricular arrhythmias. It also
decreases conduction velocity and does not shorten the refractory period as much as
idocaine.
Indications and Clinical Uses
 Phenytoin is commonly used as an anticonvulsant in people, but it is not effective in
dogs and not used in cats. In dogs, elimination is so rapid that dosing is impractical.
Phenytoin is used in horses for treating ventricular arrhythmias, controlling
myotonia, rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemic periodic paresis, and stringhalt.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects include sedation, gingival hyperplasia, skin reactions, and CNS
toxicity. In horses, at high doses recumbency and excitement have been observed.
Sedation in horses may be an initial sign of high plasma concentrations.
Monitoring plasma concentrations in horses can prevent adverse effects.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not administer to pregnant animals.
Drug Interactions
Phenytoin will interact with drugs undergoing hepatic metabolism. Phenytoin is a
potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducer. When used with cytochrome P450
inhibitors, increased levels of phenytoin may occur.
Instructions for Use
Because of short half-life and poor efficacy in dogs and questionable safety in cats,
other anticonvulsants are used as the first choice before phenytoin.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Therapeutic drug monitoring can be performed; however, therapeutic concentrations
have not been established for dogs and cats. In horses, effective plasma
Physostigmine 611
concentrations are 5-20 mcg/mL (average 8.8 mcg/mL). Therapy should be aimed
at producing concentrations above 5 mcg/mL in horses.
Formulations

612  Phytonadione
treatment of ileus and urinary retention (such as postoperative urine retention) by
increasing the tone of the bladder smooth muscle.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects caused by the cholinergic action result from inhibition of
cholinesterase. These effects can be seen in the GI tract as diarrhea and increased
secretions. Other adverse effects can include miosis, bradycardia, muscle twitching
or weakness, and constriction of bronchi and ureters. Adverse effects can be
treated with anticholinergic drugs such as atropine.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not administer with choline esters such as bethanechol.
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions have been reported in animals.
Instructions for Use
Physostigmine is indicated primarily only for treatment of intoxication. If longer-
tem or routine systemic use of an anticholinesterase drug is needed, neostigmine
and pyridostigmine are used because they have fewer adverse effects. When used,
frequency of dose may be increased based on observation of effects.

Phytonadione 613
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Vitamin K supplement. Phytonadione and phytomenadione are synthetic lipid-
soluble forms of vitamin K,. (Phytomenadione is the British spelling of
Phytonadione.) Menadiol is vitamin K4, which is a water-soluble derivative converted
in the body to vitamin Ks (menadione).
Vitamin K, is a fat-soluble vitamin used to treat coagulopathies caused by
anticoagulant toxicosis (warfanin or other rodenticides). These anticoagulants
deplete vitamin K in the body, which is essential for synthesis of clotting factors.
Administration of vitamin K, in its various formulations, can be used to reverse the
effect of anticoagulant toxicity.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Phytonadione is used to treat coagulopathies caused by anticoagulant toxicosis
poisoning.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
In people, a rare hypersensitivity-like reaction has been observed after rapid
intravenous injection. Signs resemble anaphylactic shock. These signs also have
Contraindications and Precautions
Accurate diagnosis to rule out other causes of bleeding is suggested. Other forms
of vitamin K may not be as rapidly acting as vitamin Ky; therefore consider using
a specific preparation. To avoid anaphylactic reactions, do not administer IV.
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions are reported.
Instructions for Use
P
Consult poison control center for specific protocol if specific rodenticide is
identified. Use vitamin K, for acute therapy of toxicity because it is more highly
bioavailable. Administer with food to enhance oral absorption. If an injection is
used, it can be diluted in 5% dextrose or 0.9% saline but not other solutions. The
preferred injectable route is SQ, but IM can also be used. Although vitamin K,
veterinary labels have listed the intravenous route for administration, these labels
have not been approved by the FDA. Therefore, avoid intravenous administration of
vitamin K.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitoring bleeding times in patients is essential for accurate dosing of vitamin K,
preparations. When treating long-acting rodenticide poisoning, periodic monitoring
of the bleeding times is suggested.

Pimobendan
pim-oh-ben'dan
Trade and Other Names: Vetmedin
Functional Classification: Cardiac inotropic agent
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Pmobendan is both a positive inotrope and a vasodilator. The vasodilator effects
that degrades cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP); therefore, its action is
to increase intracellular concentrations of cAMP. There may be some inhibition
of phosphodiesterase V in the pulmonary circulation. The inotropic effects of
pimobendan are attributed to its action as a calcium sensitizer rather than the
phosphodiesterase inhibition. By acting as a calcium sensitizer, it increases the
interaction of troponin C with contractile proteins and acts as a inotropic agent. The
benefits in heart failure are caused by both positive inotropic effects and vasodilating
properties. There may be other beneficial effects that include anti-inflammatory
activity, increased sensitivity of baroreceptors, increased lusitropy, and decreased
platelet aggregation. The cardiovascular effects occur after l hour and persist
for 8-l2 hours after administration. Pimobendan is absorbed best in an acidic
environment. Fluctuating pH conditions in stomach and administration with food
may produce inconsistent oral absorption.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Pimobendan is indicated for use in dogs for treatment of CHF. It has been used in
dogs with either valvular insufficiency or cardiomyopathy. It is considered by many
cardiologists as an essential initial treatment for dilated cardiomyopathy in dogs.
Pimobendan 615

furosemide). When administered at l.25 mg/cat ql2h, it has been well tolerated.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Pmobendan is potentially arrhythmogenic, but this effect (e.g., atrial fibrillation
or ventricular arrhythmias) has been rare and seen primarily in animals with
severe underlying cardiac disease. At doses of 0.25-0.5 mg/kg in dogs,
pimobendan did not activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS),
but if furosemide is added to treatment, some activation of the RAAS may occur.

Piperacillin Sodium
pih'per-ah-sill'in soe'dee-um
Trade and Other Names: Pipracil and Zosyn
Functional Classification: Antibacterial, beta-lactam
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Beta-lactam antibiotic of the acylureidopenicillin class. Like other beta-lactams,
piperacillin binds penicillin-binding proteins (PBP) that weaken or interfere with
cell wall formation. After binding to PBP, the cell wall weakens or undergoes lysis.
Like other beta-lactams, this drug acts in a time-dependent manner (i.e., it is more
effective when drug concentrations are maintained above the minimum inhibitory
concentration [MIC] values duning the dose interval). Compared to other beta-
lactam antibiotics, piperacillin has good activity against Psendom onas aeruginosa. It
also has good activity against streptococci, but is not active against methicillin-
resistant Staphylococcus. Piperacillin has a short half-life in animals and must be
given by injection (usually IV), which limits its usefulness. Some fommulations of
increases the spectrum to include beta-lactamase strains of gram-negative and
gram-positive bacteria.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Piperacillin has similar activity as ampicillin, but it is extended to include many
organisms that otherwise are resistant to ampicillin, such as Psewdomonas aeruginoso
and other gram-negative bacilli. The in vitro activity against some gram-negative
bacteria is enhanced when administered with an aminoglycoside (e.g., gentamicin or
amikacin).
Precautionary Information

Piroxicam
peer-oks'ih-kam
Trade and Other Names: Feldene and generic brands
Functional Classification: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Piroxicam is an NSAID of the oxicam class. Clinical effects are similar to other
 NSAIDs (see meloxicam). These drugs appear to have analgesic and anti-
inflammatory effects by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins. The enzyme
inhibited by NSAIDs is the cyclo-oxygenase enzyme (COX). The COX enzyme
Piroxicam  619
exists in two isofoms: COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is primarily responsible for
synthesis of prostaglandins important for maintaining a healthy GI tract, rena
function, platelet function, and other normal functions. COX-2 is induced and
responsible for synthesizing prostaglandins that are important mediators of pain,
inflammation, and fever. However, it is known that there is some crossover of
COX-1 and COX-2 effects in some situations, and COX-2 activity is important for
some biological effects. Piroxicam, using in vitro assays, is somewhat more selective
for COX-2 than COX-1. In animals, it is not certain that the specificity for COX-1
or COX-2 is related to efficacy or safety. Piroxicam also may have some antitumor
or tumor-preventative effects and is used in some anticancer protocols. Piroxicam
has a longer half-life than other NSAIDs in dogs, with a halflife of 35-40 hours and
near l00% oral abosrption. The half-life is shorter in other species, with a half-life
in cats of l3 hours and average oral absorption of 89% and a half-life in horses of
3-4 hours.
Indications and Clinical Uses
 Proxicam is primarily used to treat pain and inflammation associated with arthritis
and other musculoskeletal conditions. It is not used as much for these conditions as
other approved NSAIDs for animals. Another use in dogs and cats has been as an
adjunct for treating cancer. This use is based on reports of its activity for treating
or suppressing some tumors, including transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder,
squamous cell carcinoma, and mammary adenocarcinoma. Piroxicam has been used
in combination with cisplatin to treat oral malignant melanoma and oral squamous
cell carcinoma in dogs (0.3 mg/kg).
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Elimination of piroxicam is slow. At 0.3 mg/kg q24h, PO, adverse reactions
P
have been observed in dogs, and an administration interval of every 48 hours
should be considered. Adverse effects are primarily GI toxicity (e.g-, gastric
ulcers). Renal toxicity also is a risk, especially in animals prone to dehydration or
that have compromised renal function. Toxic epidermal necrolysis has been

treatment for cancer with few adverse effects, but GI erosions and ulcers are
possible.
Contraindications and Precautions
Use cautiously in dogs because the long half-life may increase nisk of GI ulcers if
administered once daily. The human fomulation is too large a dose for most
dogs and should be reformulated to avoid overdose. Warn pet owners about
overdoses that could produce GI ulceration. Do not administer to animals prone
to GI ulcers. Do not administer to pregnant animals. Use cautiously in any
animal with renal disease or if administered with other drugs that may injure the
kidney, such as cisplatin.
Drug Interactions
Do not administer with other NSAIDs or with corticosteroids. Corticosteroids
have been shown to exacerbate the gastrointestinal adverse effects. Some NSAIDs
may interfere with the action of diuretic drugs and angiotensin-converting
enzyme {ACE) inhibitors
620 Plicamycin
Instructions for Use
 Most experience with dosing has been accumulated from studies in which dogs
were treated with piroxicam for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Some of
these dogs tolerated piroxicam better, with respect to GI toxicity, if the drug was
administered with misoprostol. Piroxicam has also been used in dogs for treatment
of squamous cell carcinoma.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests

Polymyxin B Sulfate 623
Polymyxin B Sulfate
poly mix-in bee
Trade and Other Names: Generic
Functional Classification: Antibacterial agent
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antibiotic, antibacterial agent. Polymyxin B is from a group of polypeptide
antibiotics. Polymyxins are basic surface-active cationic detergents that interact with
membrane of bacteria and disrupting the structure. This action subsequently induces
permeability changes within the cell that result in cell death, giving polymyxins
bactericidal properties. Polymyxins contain seven amino acids in a cyclic configuration
and have a molecular weight of more than l000. Other polymyxins have been named
A, B, C, D, E, and M, but only B and E in their sulfate salt forms are used clinically.
Polymyxin B sulfate is a mixture of polymyxin Bl and polymyxin B2. Polymyxin
E is more commonly known as colistin, which is also used systemically for some
infections. Polymyxin B has a pKa ranging from 8 to 9 derived from the organism
Bacillus polymyxa. It is available in many topical formulations, often in formulations
a sulfate salt of two forms: Polymyxins Bl and B2. It is available in formulations of
q s n s  d s  od   s
Polymyxins are not absorbed from the GI tract when administered orally but are
rapidly absorbed when given parenterally and have 70%-90% plasma protein binding.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Polymyxin B for injection is in powder form suitable for preparation of sterile
solutions for intramuscular, intravenous drip, intrathecal, or ophthalmic use.
Polymyxin B is most often administered as a topical ointment for managing infections.
It is one of the components of “triple antibiotic” ointments used for topical use.
Systemically, polymyxin has been used to treat infections that are resistant to other
drugs. Bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter may develop
resistance to other drugs that can be treated only with drugs such as colistin and
polymyxin. In people, polymyxin B is used to treat UTI, meningitis, and septicemia.
There are no well-controlled clinical studies or efficacy trials to document clinical
effectiveness in animals for treating bactenial infections. In veterinary medicine-
particularly horses—polymyxn has been used because of its property to bind bacterial
endotoxin in the blood and prevent signs of bacterial septicemia. Infusions ranging
from 1000 to 10,000 units per kg (a common dose is 6000 units/kg, equivalent to
1 mg/kg) administered every 8 hours have been shown to be safe and effective for
treating endotoxemia in horses. The action is attributed to the cationic portion of
polymyxin B binding to the anionic lipid A portion of this endotoxin. This effectively
renders the endotoxin inactive, thereby preventing most of the adverse effects that
gram-negative endotoxin has on the mammalian body.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
IM injections will cause pain. Because of its ability to bind to phospholipid
membranes and cause injury, the most severe adverse reaction is caused by renal
injury. At the dose used for treating bacterial endotoxemia in horses, renal injury
624 Polymyxin B Sulfate
has not been observed. However, at higher doses (18,000-36,000 units/kg) or
for longer treatment protocols, renal injury risk increases. Allergic reactions are
also possible.
Contraindications and Precautions
Use cautiously, if at all, in patients with renal disease. Animals receiving
renal perfusion.
Drug Interactions
Use cautiously with other potentially nephrotoxic agents such as aminoglycosides
 Do not administer with curariform muscle relaxant and other neurotoxic drugs
because of risk of respiratory depression. Polymyxin antibacterial activity is
decreased in the presence of pus, in tissues containing acidic phospholipids, and
in the presence of anionic detergents.
Instructions for Use
 Use in veternary medicine has been primarily confined to topical use, and the use in
horses to treat endotoxemia. Doses and regimens have been derived from
experimental studies. Route of administration have been topical IM, IV infusion,
intrathecal, or ophthalmic.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
 Monitor patient hydration and electrolyte status. Monitor renal parameters (e.g
creatinine and BUN) for evidence of renal disease.
Formulations
Polymyxin B is available in vials containing 500,000 polymyxin B units. In some
dosage protocols, the dose is listed in milligrams instead of units. One milligram of
polymyxin B base is equivalent to 10,000 units of polymyxin B, and each microgram
of pure polymyxin B base is equivalent to l0 units of polymyxin B.
Stability and Storage
Store at room temperature 20*C to 25"C (68*F to 77"F), protected from light.
Polymyxin B is soluble in water at 0.5% solution with a pH of 5-7.5. Aqueous

Functional Classification: Antifungal
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antifungal drug. Posaconazole is a relatively new antifungal of the azole group,
similar to itraconazole in structure and activity. Action against fungi is similar to
other azoles, which is to inhibit ergosterol synthesis in the fungal cell membrane and
produce fungistatic activity. It is active against the same fungal organisms as
itraconazole, but in vitro activity is twice as great. The most important difference in
activity is that posaconazole has better activity against Mwcor and Zygomycetes
628 Posaconazole
compared to other azoles. In dogs, there is a food effect on absorption with oral
systemic availability of 1l% and 27% in fasted and fed dogs, respectively. It is highly
protein bound with binding greater than 97% in dogs.
Indications and Clinical Uses
drugs such as Aspergillosis and Mwcor infections. In humans it is used for invasive
fungal infections, including those caused by Aspergillus and Candida. It is also
active against dermatophytes,Histoplasmn capsnlatum, Blastomyces dermatitidis,
Coccidioides immitis,and Cryptococcus neoformans.Its advantage over other azole
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
The use has been relatively infrequent, and information regarding the full range
of adverse effects possible from clinical use is not available. In people, similar
adverse effects have been observed as with other azole antifingal drugs:
headache, diarrhea, nausea, and increased liver enzymes. In toxicity studies, dogs
have tolerated 30 mg/kg/day for l year without any clinical signs. However,
histologically some neuronal vacuolation was observed at this dose. It should not
be used during pregnancy because of inhibition of steroidogenesis.
Contraindications and Precautions
Drug Interactions
Drugs that decrease stomach acid (proton pump inhibitors, H, blockers) will
reduce oral absorption of posaconazole. Like other azole antifungal drugs,
posaconazole is a strong inhibitor of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP3A4) and
may increase concentrations of other drugs metabolized by these enzymes.

Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Potassum supplement. Potassium is used for treatment of hypokalemia. A dose
1.9 g of potassium chloride is equivalent to l g of potassium. One gram of
include potassium gluconate, potassium acetate, potassium bicarbonate, and
potassium citrate.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Potassium supplements are indicated for treating hypokalemia. Hypokalemia may
occur with some diseases or as a consequence of diuretic use. Hypokalemia may also
occur as a consequence of beta-2 adrenergic agonist overdose. In most patients,
potassium chloride is the supplement of choice for hypokalemia. It is better
absorbed than other supplements, and the chloride ion may be helpful because
hypochloremia may also occur in some patients.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Toxicity from high potassium concentrations can be dangerous. Hyperkalemia

can lead to cardiovascular toxicity (bradycardia and arrest) and muscular
weakness. Oral potassium supplements can cause nausea and stomach
irritation.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not exceed a rate of 0.5 mEq/kg/hr IV infusion. Use cautiously in animals
with renal disease. Do not use potassium chloride if metabolic acidosis and
hyperchloremia are present. Use another potassium supplement instead.
Intravenous use should be done cautiously because of risk of hyperkalemia. Use
potassium cautiously in digitalized patients. Do not use with potassium penicillin
or potassium bromide (use sodium salts of these drugs instead).

been used as an adjunctive treatment for zygomycosis, conidiobolomycosis, and
fungal granuloma. Iodide is also important for thyroid gland function and has been
used to treat some thyroid disorders. Potassium iodide also may irritate the
Indications and Clinical Uses
Potassium iodide has been used to treat fungal granulomatous disease and infections
associated with zygomycetes. In small animals it has been used for sporotrichosis.
The antifungal treatment has been questioned for animals because the effcacy is not
established. Because it may increase respiratory secretions, it has been used as an
expectorant, but the efficacy has not been established. In people, iodide has been
used to treat hyperthyroidism, but effectiveness for this use in cats has not been
established. Potassium iodide is also used to protect the thyroid gland from radiation
injury in the event of a radiation emergency (accidental exposure to radiation) or
following administration of radioactive iodide.
Ethylenediamine dihydroiodide (EDDI) is another source of iodide that is used
as a nutritional source of iodine in cattle. Sodium iodide also is used, particularly in
large animals. See Sodium Iodide and Iodide monograph for more information.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
High doses can produce signs of iodism, which include lacrimation, irritation of
mucous membranes, swelling of eye lids, cough, dry scruffy coat, and hair loss.
Potassium iodide has a bitter taste and can cause nausea and salivation. Potassium

Functional Classification: Antibacterial
P
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
fluoroquinolones. This new generation of fluoroquinolones, with substitutions
spectrum that includes anaerobic bacteria and gram-positive cocci. The difference in
spectrum of activity is largely caused by increased activity against the DNA-gyrase
of gram-positive bacteria, rather than activity against topoisomerase IV, which is the
target in gram-positive bacteria for the older quinolones (e.g., enrofloxacin,
marbofloxacin, orbifloxacin, difloxacin). These newer fluoroquinolones (referred to
by some authors as the third-generation fluoroquinolones) include gatifloxacin,
gemifloxacin, and moxifloxacin. Susceptibility data indicate that it is more active
than other fluoroquinolones against bactenial isolates from dogs and cats, including
Escherichia coli, Staphylococcns, and anaerobes. At the time of this writing (20l0)
pradofloxacin was approved for small animal use in Europe, but not in the U.S.
Another drug with a similar spectrum of activity is the human drug, moxifloxacin,
which has been used in clinical situations where pradofloxacin would be a rational
choice.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Pradofloxacin has been evaluated in dogs and cats, with efficacy studies published in
research abstracts and clinical reports in which it has been used for treating skin and

soft tissue infections in dogs and cats, respiratory infections in cats, and urinary tract
infections. At a dose of 3 mg/kg orally it was effective for treatment of urinary tract
infections in dogs, and at 3 or 5 mg/kg it was effective for canine pyoderma. At a
dose of 5 mg/kg in a 2.5% oral suspension it was effective for urinary tract

rhinitis caused by Mycopiasma, Bordetella, streptococi, or staphylococci at a dose of
5 mg/kg once daily for 7 doses.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
A complete range of adverse reactions is not available because of the limited
clinical use. It is anticipated that some of the adverse effects seen with other
fluoroquinolones may also be possible with pradofloxacin. However, compared to
Contraindications and Precautions
 No contraindications or precautions are available. Because it is similar to other
fluoroquinolones, use cautiously in young dogs that may be susceptible to
articular cartilage injury.
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions have been reported in animals.
Instructions for Use
The uses are based on the clinical reports in dogs and cats currently available. At the
time of marketing the drug sponsor may release additional data to guide dosing.

Prednisolone Sodium Succinate 641
Prednisolone Sodium Succinate
pred-niss-oh'lone soe'dee-um suk'sih-nate
Trade and Other Names: Solu-Delta-Cortef
Functional Classification: Corticosteroid
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Prednisolone sodium succinate is the same as prednisolone, except that this is a
water-soluble formmulation intended for acute therapy when high intravenous doses
are needed for rapid effect.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Prednisolone sodium succinate has similar uses as prednisolone in other forms,
except this is used when prompt response is needed from injection, especially at high
doses. Methylprednisolone sodium succinate (Solu-Medrol) has also been used for
similar indications. Uses include treatment of immune-mediated diseases (e.g-
pemphigus and hemolytic anemia), spinal cord trauma, and adrenocortical
treatment of recurrent airway obstruction (RAO) in horses. In cattle, corticosteroids
have been used in the treatment of ketosis. The use of prednisolone for treatment of
shock, snakebites, and head trauma is discouraged because of lack of proven efficacy
or high risk of adverse effects.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects are not expected from single administration. However, with
repeated use, other side effects are possible. Side effects from corticosteroids are
many and include polyphagia, polydipsia/polyuria, and hypothalamic-pituitary-
adrenal (HPA) axis suppression. Adverse effects include GI ulceration, diarrhea,
steroid hepatopathy, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, decreased thyroid
homone, decreased protein synthesis, impaired wound healing, and
immunosuppression. In cats, polyuria is less common than in dogs and it has not
increased calcium excretion or calcium-containing calculi. With high doses of
prednisolone sodium succinate, there is a risk of GI bleeding. In horses, in
addition to the previously listed adverse effects, there may be an increased risk of
laminitis, although documentation of this effect has been controversial.
Contraindications and Precautions
Use cautiously in patients with a risk of GI ulcers and bleeding or infection or in
animals in which growing or healing is necessary. Use prednisolone sodium
succinate cautiously in patients with renal disease because it may cause azotemia.
Use cautiously in pregnant animals because fetal abnormalities have been
reported in laboratory rodents.
Drug Interactions
Administration of corticosteroids with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) will increase the risk of GI injury. Do not mix prednisolone sodium
succinate with solutions containing calcium.
Instructions for Use
 Doses for prednisolone are based on severity of underlying condition. Use of
prednisolone sodium succinate is often at high doses for acute treatment.

Prednisone 645
Prednisone
pred'nih-sone
Trade and Other Names: Deltasone, Meticorten, and generic brands
Functional Classification: Corticosteroid
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Glucocorticoid anti-inflammatory drug. The effect of prednisone is attributed to
prednisolone. After administration, prednisone is converted to prednisolone.
Anti-inflammatory effects are complex, but via binding to cellular glucocorticoid
receptors, prednisolone acts to inhibit inflammatory cells and suppresses expression
of inflammatory mediators. Prednisolone is approximately four times more potent
to be well absorbed and converted to active drug in dogs. However, in horses and
cats, administration of prednisone results in low systemic levels of the active drug
prednisolone, either because of poor absorption of prednisone or because of a
Indications and Clinical Uses
Prednisone, like other corticosteroids, is used to treat a variety of inflammatory and
immune-mediated diseases. In cats, prednisone may produce therapeutic failures, and

Pregabalin  647
Pregabalin
Pree ga' bah-lin
Trade and Other Names: Lyrica
Functional Classification: Analgesic, Anticonvulsant
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Analgesic and anticonvulsant. Pregabalin is similar in action to gabapentin, which is
an analogue of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. However, like gabapentin, it is
not an agonist or antagonist for the GABA receptor. The anticonvulsant effect occurs
via inhibition of calcium channels in neurons. Pregabalin inhibits the alpha-2-delta
inhibition, it reduces calcium influx that is needed for release of neurotransmitters-
specifically excitatory amino acids—from presynaptic neurons. Blocking the channels
has little effect on normal neurons but may suppress simulated neurons involved in
[o nq sey uqiaid 'suny un 'ued jo say sos pue aae ainzis
absorption and a longer half-life than gabapentin. Pregabalin half-life in dogs is
approximately 7 hours, comparted to 3-4 hours for gabapentin, and it remained above
the estimated effective levels for ll hours after dosing. In cats, after 4 mg/kg oral,
plasma concentrations were above the levels estimated to be effective for over
12 hours, with a half-life of l0 hours. Pregabalin relies on renal excretion, probably to
a greater extent than gabapentin.
Indications and Clinical Uses
 In people, pregabalin is popular for treating neuropathic pain syndromes associated
with diabetes, postherpetic neuralgia, and fbromyalgia. Pregabalin is also used as an
It may be combined with those agents. When used to treat epilepsy, pregabalin has
reduced seizure frequency in refractory patients when combined with phenobarbital
and potassium bromide. Therefore, it is considered when the seizures have become
refractory to other drugs in conjunction with other anticonvulsants. For treating
pain, regimens have been mostly derived from anecdotal evidence or extrapolation
from human medicine.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
as 3-4 mg/kg. As dose increases in dogs sedation is more likely. In people a
withdrawal syndrome from abrupt discontinuation has been described, but it is
not reported in animals.
Contraindications and Precautions
No known contraindications. Pregabalin, like gabapentin, is excreted in the urine,
and liver disease or drug metabolism interactions are not expected to affect the
pharmacokinetics. Protein binding is low. In people it has been used with other
 anticonvulsants and anesthetics without producing a pharmacokinetic drug
interaction.
Drug Interactions
648  Primidone
Instructions for Use
Pregabalin may be administered with or without food. Pregabalin has been used in
some animals with other drugs such as phenobarbital and bromide. It also has been
used to treat neuropathic pain syndromes and can be used with NSAIDs and
opioids.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
No specific monitoring is necessary. Routine measurement of plasma concentrations
is not widely available, but therapeutic concentrations in people (2.8-8.2 mcg/mL)
have been used as a guideline. In some dogs, mild increases in liver enzymes may be
observed during treatment.
Formulations
Pregabalin is available in 25-,50-, 75-, 100-, 150-, 200-, 225-, and 300-mg
capsules and oral solution of 20 mg/mL.

Primidone
prih'mih-done
Trade and Other Names: Mylepsin, Neurosyn, and Mysoline (in Canada)
Functional Classification: Anticonvulsant
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Anticonvulsant. Primidone is converted to phenylethylmalonamide (PEMA) and
phenobarbital, both of which have anticonvulsant activity, but most of the activity
(85%) is probably because of the phenobarbital. Phenobarbital acts to potentiate the
inhibitory effects of GABA-mediated chloride channels.
Primidone 649
Indications and Clinical Uses
Primidone is used for treating seizure disorders in animals, including epilepsy. The
effects of primidone are primarily produced by the presence of the active metabolite,
refractory to phenobarbital alone will respond better to primidone, the number of
such cases is low. Primidone is approved for use in dogs, but its use has declined in
favor of administration of phenobarbital, bromide, or other anticonvulsants.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Because pnimidone is converted to phenobarbital, adverse effects are the same as
for phenobarbital. Primidone has been associated with idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity
in dogs. Although some labels caution its use in cats, one study in experimental
cats determined that it is safe if used at recommended doses.
Contraindications and Precautions
There may be a higher risk of hepatic toxicity with primidone as compared to
other anticonvulsants. Primidone should be avoided in animals with liver disease.
Drug Interactions
 Primidone is converted to phenobarbital, which is one of the most potent drugs
for inducing hepatic microsomal metabolizing enzymes. Therefore, many drugs
administered concurrently will have lower (and perhaps subtherapeutic)
concentrations because of more rapid clearance. Drugs affected may include
theophylline, digoxin, corticosteroids, anesthetics, and many others (see Appendix
list for drugs that affect cytochrome P450 enzymes).
Instructions for Use
 Recommendations are similar to those for phenobarbital. When monitoring therapy
with primidone, phenobarbital plasma concentrations should be measured to
estimate anticonvulsant effect. When converting a patient from primidone therapy to
phenobarbital, the conversion is as follows: 60 mg phenobarbital is approximately
250 mg of primidone.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Doses should be carefilly adjusted via monitoring serum/plasma phenobarbital
concentrations. Collect a sample at any time during the dose interval because the
timing of the sample is not critical. Avoid the use of plasma separation devices if the
tube is to be stored. The therapeutic range in dogs is considered 15-40 mcg/mL
(65-180 mmol/L). The optimum range in cats for therapeutic effect is 23-28 mcg/
mL. Monitor liver function with bile-acid determinations.

procainamide (NAPA), which produces other antiarrhythmic actions (Class III drug:
potassium channel-blocking effects). However, dogs do not form this metabolite
because of an inability to acetylate some drugs.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Procainamide is used in small animals to suppress ventricular ectopic beats and treat
ventricular arrhythmias. Studies in experimental dogs with induced arrhythmias have
documented effcacy, but clinical use is based primarily on anecdotal experience.
It is used primarily during acute treatment and can be administered by injection or
tablet. Rarely is long-term treatment used. Procainamide has occasionally been used
 in horses to suppress ventricular arrhythmias.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects include cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac depression, tachycardia, and
reactions), but these have not been reported in animals.
Contraindications and Precautions
Procainamide can suppress the heart and produce proarrhythmic effects. Use
cautiously in animals receiving digoxin because it may potentiate arrhythmias.
Drug Interactions
Drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes (e.g., cimetidine) can potentially
increase procainamide concentrations.
Instructions for Use
Because dogs do not produce active metabolite N-acetyl procainamide (NAPA), the
dose may be higher compared to dosage for people to control some arrhythmias. In

preanesthetic. The approved label use indicates that it is “intended for
administration to dogs as a tranquilizer. It is used as an aid in handling difficult,
excited, and unruly dogs, and in controlling excessive kennel barking, car sickness,
and severe dermatitis. It is also indicated for use in minor surgery and prior to
routine examinations, laboratory procedures, and diagnostic procedures." Despite
this labeling, some of these indications are outdated and there are better treatments
to manage these conditions.

Propofol
proe'poe-fole
Trade and Other Names: Rapinovet, Propoflo (veterinary preparations), and
Diprivan (human preparation)
Functional Classification: Anesthetic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Anesthetic. Mechanism of action is not well-defined but may be barbiturate-like.
Propofol produces a short-acting (l0 minutes) anesthesia, followed by a rapid and
smooth recovery. The original formulation contained propofol in castor oil and
other formulations containing soybean oil, glycerol, and purified egg phosphatide
The newest formulation contains l% propofol in an emulsion mixture of medium-
and long-chain triglycerides that produces greater encapsulation and lower
concentration of free propofol.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Propofol is used as a short-term injectable anesthetic. It may be used as an induction
agent followed by inhalation with halothane or isoflurane. The advantage of
propofol over other agents is smooth, rapid recovery. It can be used with
acepromazine, diazepam, alpha-2 agonists (e.g., dexmedetomidine), butorphanol,
and inhalant anesthetics. An additional use of propofol is treatment of status
qpilepticus. It has been used safely and effectively for short-term induction and
anesthetic episodes in dogs and cats without producing adverse effects.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Apnea and respiratory depression are the most common adverse effects, which are
more likely when the dose is increased. Propofol can induce a dose-dependent
cardiovascular depression, but the severity of cardiac adverse events is generally
low. However, propofol can induce vasodilation, which can be minimized by
movements (paddling, tremors, muscle ridgidity), panting , nystagmus, salivation,
Propofol 659
and retraction of tongue in some animals (incidence 3%-7%). Less frequent
adverse reactions include vomiting during recovery and pain. Pain upon injection

caused by the free propofol in the formulation and is decreased with newer
formulations. Phenolic drugs such as propofol may potentially cause oxidative
damage to hemoglobin in cats because of higher concentration of oxidizable
sulfhydral groups in feline RBCs {leading to Heinz-body formation and
methemoglobinemia). However, this has not been a consistent problem with
rputine clinical use, and repeated anesthetic episodes have been performed safely
in cats.
Contraindications and Precautions
Propofol can induce apnea, hypoxia, and cyanosis upon induction. Supplemental
oxygen should be available to prevent adverse effects. Do not administer to
hypotensive animals. When propofol has been used to sedate animals for
 intradermal skin testing, it may produce a greater number of positive reactions.
Drug Interactions
Propofol can be used with several other anesthetics and adjuncts safely. Propofol
 has been mixed with thiopental sodium (2.5%) in a l: 1 mixture without loss of
effectiveness. However, it should not be mixed in a syringe with other anesthetics
unless compatibility is known
Instructions for Use
     s s    s
may be diluted in 5% dextrose, lactated Ringer's solution, and 0.9% saline but not
to less than 2 mg/mL concentration. Delay in penetration to brain is approximately
3 minutes; therefore there is a delayed CNS effect during injection. When using
with other drugs, (acepromazine, barbiturates, opiates, etc.) lower doses should be
administered. A mixture of l :1 thiopental (2.5%) and propofol can be used in dogs
and results in a smooth induction.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor respiration rate and character during anesthesia with propofol.
Formulations
Propofol is available in 1% (10 mg/mL) injection in 20-mL ampules.
Stability and Storage
Shake well before use. Once an ampule has been opened, discard within 6 hours.
 Use careful technique to prevent microbial contamination of vial. Propofol has 
been mixed with thiopental sodium in a l :l mixture, and they are physically and
chemically compatible. However, do not mix with other drugs unless compatibility
(4°C-22"C). Do not freeze.

Propranolol Hydrochloride
proe-pran'oh-lole hye-droe-klor'ide
Trade and Other Names: Inderal and generic brands
Functional Classification: Beta blocker
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Beta-adrenergic blocker. Nonselective for betaj- and betaz-adrenergic receptors.
Class II antiarrhythmic. Propranolol is a lipophilic beta blocker and relies on the
iver for clearance. Lipophilic beta blockers such as propranolol undergo high
frst-pass clearance, which reduces oral bioavailability and causes high interpatient
variability in plasma concentrations and effects. Drug concentrations may be higher
when there is impaired liver blood flow.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Propranolol is used primarily to decrease heart rate, decrease cardiac
conduction, control tachyarrhythmias, and decrease blood pressure. Propranolol
is effective in controlling the response from adrenergic stimulation. Beta

Propranolol Hydrochloride 661
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects related to betaj-blocking effects on heart. Propranolol causes
cardiac depression and decreases cardiac output. Betaz-blocking effects can cause
bronchoconstriction and decrease insulin secretion. Weakness and fatique can be
caused by beta blockers, which can indicate that a reduction in dose is needed.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not administer to animals with low cardiac reserve, bradycardia, or poor
systolic function. Use cautiously in animals with respiratory problems;
bronchoconstriction can occur from betaz effects. Hyperthyroid cats may have
reduced clearance and increased risk of toxicity.
Drug Interactions
Lipophilic beta blockers, such as propranolol, rely on the liver for clearance. These
drugs are subject to interactions from drugs that affect liver blood flow and interact
with hepatic enzymes. Decreased liver blood flow will reduce propranolol clearance.
Instructions for Use
Usually dose is titrated according to patient's response. Start with low dose and
increase gradually to desired effect. Clearance relies on hepatic blood flow; use
consider reducing the dose to prevent adverse effects. Cats with hyperthyroidism
may have decreased clearance or increased oral absorption compared to other cats.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor heart rate during treatment. Monitor respiratory function in patients prone
to bronchoconstniction.
Formulations
Propranolol is available in 10-, 20-, 40-, 60-, 80-, and 90-mg tablets; 1-mg/mL
injection; and 4- and 8-mg/mL oral solution.
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature.
Propranolol is soluble in water and ethanol. Suspensions prepared in various syrups
and flavorings were stable for 4 months, but some settling may occur (shake before
administration). pH of fomulations should be kept at 2.8-4 for maximum stability.

Propylthiouracil
pro-pil-thye-oh-yoo'rah-sil
Trade and Other Names: Propyl-Thyracil, PTU, and genenic brands
Functional Classification: Antithyroid
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antithyroid drug. Propylthiouracil inhibits synthesis of thyroid hormones;
specifically, it interferes with conversion of T4 to T3.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Propylthiouracil has been used for the treatment of feline hyperthyroidism. Because
of adverse effects, use of propylthiouracil in most cats has been replaced with
methimazole or carbimazole. The only remaining indication for propylthiouracil in
animals is to treat an acute “thyroid storm” because it rapidly inhibits conversion of
T3 to T4, which methimazole does not.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects in cats include hepatopathy, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia,
and other signs of immune-mediated disease. If these signs are observed, the
medication should be changed to another antithyroid agent.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not use in cats with low platelet counts or bleeding problems
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions have been reported in animals.
Instructions for Use
Avoid the use of propylthiouracil because of the frequency of adverse effects. Other
drugs can be used as a replacement such as methimazole or carbimazole.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor CBC to look for evidence of hematologic abnormalities. Monitor T4 levels
to assess therapy.

Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Prostaglandin F2 (PGF2) alpha simulates the action of endogenous PGF2 alpha in
animals. It induces luteolysis and will terminate pregnancy. It is also called
Dinoprost.
Indications and Clinical Uses
 PGF2 alpha has been used to treat open pyometra in animals. In cattle, Dinoprost
has been used for treatment of chronic endometritis. Use for inducing abortion
in small animals has been questioned and other drugs are usually used instead.
However, in large animals, Dinoprost is used to induce abortion in the first 100

Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
PGF2 alpha causes increased smooth muscle tone, resulting in diarrhea,
abdominal discomfort, bronchoconstriction, and an increase in blood pressure. In
small animals, other side effects include vomiting. Induction of abortion may
cause retained placenta.
Contraindications and Precautions
 Do not administer IV. PGF2 alpha induces abortion in pregnant animals. Use
caution when handling this drug. It should not be handled by pregnant women.

Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride
soo-doh-eh-fed'rin hve-droe-klor'ide
Trade and Other Names: Sudafed and generic brands
Functional Classification: Adrenergic agonist
Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride 665
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Adrenergic agonist. Pseudoephedrine is a sympathomimetic. It nonselectively
acts as an agonist for the alpha-adrenergic and beta-adrenergic receptors. These
receptors are found throughout the body, such as on sphincters, blood vessels, smooth
muscle, and heart. Pseudoephednine produces a similar effect as ephedrine and
phenylpropanolamine. However, compared to ephedrine it may have fewer CNS effects.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Pseudoephednine has been used as a decongestant, as a mild bronchodilator, and to
increase tone of urinary sphincter. Pseudoephedrine, phenylpropanolamine, and
ephedrine have similar alpha-receptor and beta-receptor effects. The most common
use in animals is for treating uninary incontinence. The mechanism for this action
appears to be via stimulating receptors on the sphincter. In people, it has been
used as a decongestant. However, because pseudoephedrine is easily diverted to
manufacture of methamphetamine, the availability in human medicine has
diminished unless available by prescription. Most of the over-the-counter forms
and combination products for people have been removed. For animals,
phenylpropanolamine will produce similar effects and may be substituted.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects are attributed to adrenergic effects. These include excitement,
rapid heart rate, increased blood pressure, and arrhythmias.
Contraindications and Precautions
Pseudoephedrine may cause some effects that are similar to phenylpropanolamine.
Use cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disease. Use cautiously, or not at
all, with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs; e.g., selegiline). Beta agonists
such as pseudoephedrine may increase blood glucose. Pseudoephedrine has been
P
Therefore, the availability of pseudoephednine has been limited in most states.
Drug Interactions
Pseudoephedrine, like other sympathomimetic agents, is expected to potentiate
other alpha- and beta-receptor agonists. It may cause increased vasoconstriction
and changes in heart rate. Use cautiously with other vasoactive drugs. Use
cautiously with other drugs that may lower seizure threshold. Use of inhalant
anesthetics with PPA may increase cardiovascular risk. Do not use with tricyclic
antidepressants (TCAs) or MAOIs (e.g., selegiline or amitraz).
Instructions for Use
Although clinical trials have not been conducted for comparison, it is believed that
the action and efficacy of pseudoephednine is similar to ephedrine and
phenylpropanolamine.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor heart rate in patients. If possible, monitor blood pressure and ECG in
patients that may be susceptible to cardiovascular problems.
Formulations Available
Pseudoephedrine is available in 30- and 60-mg tablets, 120-mg capsules, and 6-mg/

Psyllium
sill' ee-um
Trade and Other Names: Metamucil and generic brands
Functional Classification: Laxative
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Bulk-forming laxative. The action of psyllium is to absorb water and expand to
provide increased bulk and moisture content to the stool, which encourages normal
peristalsis and bowel motility. Psyllium also may have antilipidemia effects.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Psyllium is administered orally for treatment of constipation and bowel evacuation.
In horses, it has been used for treating sand colic, but the effectiveness for this
indication has not been shown.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects have not been reported in animals. Intestinal impaction can occur
with overuse or in patients with inadequate fluid intake. In horses, it may be
diffcult to administer via stomach tube because it is prone to forming a gel when
mixed with water.
Contraindications and Precautions

class include morantel. Pyrantel acts to interfere with ganglionic neurotransmission
via blocking with acetylcholine receptors and other sites. This causes paralysis of the
Sd   is s   se s  sd
Pyrantel is poorly water soluble and not absorbed systemically in ruminants,
although some absorption occurs in monogastric animals. Most of the activity is
confined to the intestinal lumen.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Pyrantel is indicated for treatment of intestinal nematodes. In horses,
pyrantel is used for treatment and prevention of nematodes, including pinworms
(Oxynris eqwi), large roundworms ( Parascaris eqworwm), large strongyles
(Strongylus edentatus, S. eqwinns, and S. vuigaris), and small strongyles. When
added to medicated feed it is used to control nematodes, including pinworms
(O. equi), large roundworms (P. eqnorum), large strongyles (S. edentatus,
S. vulgaris, and Triodontophorws species), and small strongyles. In pigs it is used for
prevention of large roundworm ( Ascaris suwm) and prevention of the nodular
worm, Oesophagostomnm species. In dogs and cats, it is used for treatment of
nematodes, including hookworms (Ancylostoma species) and roundworms
(Toxocara cati, T. canis and Toxascaris leonina). There is some evidence that it is
effective for control of some tapeworms, but ordinarily other drugs should be used
for tapeworms.

Pyridostigmine Bromide 669
Pyridostigmine Bromide
peer-id-oh-stig'meen broe'mide
Trade and Other Names: Mestinon and Regonol
Functional Classification: Anticholinesterase, antimyasthenic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Cholinesterase inhibitor and antimyasthenic drug. This drug inhibits the enzyme
that breaks down acetylcholine. Therefore it prolongs the action of acetylcholine at
the synapse. The major difference between physostigmine and neostigmine or
others do not. Compared to neostigmine, pyridostigmine has a longer duration of
action.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Pyridostigmine is used as an antidote for anticholinergic intoxication and treatment
(antidote) for neuromuscular blockade. It is also used as a treatment of myasthenia
bladder smooth muscle. Most often, pyrnidostigmine is the frst drug of choice for
myasthenia gravis and is preferred over neostigmine.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects are caused by the cholinergic action resulting from inhibition of
cholinesterase. These effects can be seen in the GI tract as diarrhea and increased
secretions. Other adverse effects can include miosis, bradycardia, muscle twitching
or weakness, and constriction of bronchi and ureters. Pyridostigmine may be
associated with fewer adverse effects than neostigmine, but the effects of
P
pyridostigmine may persist longer. If adverse effects are observed, treat with
anticholinergic drugs such as 0.125 mg of hyoscyamine sulfate. Atropine also
may be used.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not use in these conditions: urinary obstruction, intestinal obstruction,
asthma or bronchoconstriction, pneumonia, and cardiac arrhythmias. Do not use
in patients sensitive to bromide. Consider the amount of bromide in dose in any
patient also receiving bromide (KBr) for treatment of seizures.
Drug Interactions
Bromide concentration in the formulation should be considered for animals also
receiving bromide (e.g., potassium bromide) for treatment of epilepsy. (Sodium
bromide may be used as an alternative.)
Instructions for Use
Pyridostigmine is used for treatment of myasthenia gravis. Neostigmine and
pyridostigmine have fewer side effects than physostigmine. When used, frequency
of dose may be increased based on observation of effects. After administration,
pyridostigmine benefits should be observed in approximately 15-30 minutes. The
duration of action may be 3-4 hours.

Pyrimethamine
peer-ih-meth'ah-meen
Trade and Other Names: Daraprim
Functional Classification: Antibactenial
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antibacterial and antiprotozoal drug. Pyrimethamine blocks the dihydrofolate
reductase enzyme, which inhibits synthesis of reduced folate and nucleic acids.
Activity of pyrimethamine is more specific against protozoa than bacteria.
Pyrimethamine is often combined with a sulfonamide to produce a synergistic effect.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Pyrimethamine is used to treat protozoal infections in animals. It is most often
combined with a sulfonamide, either separately, or in a combined formulation. See
 pyrimethamine + sulfadiazine monograph for additional information.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
There is a risk of folic acid anemia when pyrimethamine and sulfonamide
combinations are administered. This has been observed in l2% of treated horses
to prevent anemia, but benefit of this treatment is unclear. Bone marrow
suppression usually resolves after discontinuation of treatment. Diarrhea may
Pyrimethamine 671
occur after oral administration. Multiple adverse effects have been documented
from administration of sulfonamides. These include allergic reactions, Type II
and III hypersensitivity, arthropathy, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatopathy,
hypothyroidism (with prolonged therapy), keratoconjunctivitis sicca, and skin
reactions. Dogs may be more sensitive to sulfonamides than other animals
tecause dogs lack the ability to acetylate sulfonamides to metabolites.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not administer to animals sensitive to sulfonamides.
Drug Interactions
Drug interactions are not reported for animals. However, a combination of
 pyrimethamine with trimethoprim/sulfonamides will enhance the bone marrow
toxicity.
Instructions for Use
Pyrimethamine is used either alone or in combination with sulfonamides. (See
Pyrimethamine + sulfadiazine combination for further details.)
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor CBC periodically in animals receiving treatment.

protozoa.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Pyrimethamine + sulfadiazine is used to treat horses with equine protozoal
myeloencephalitis (EPM). Although not registered for use to treat other animals, the
equine formulation has been administered to small animals to treat protozoal
infections caused by Toxoplasmn, Neosporn, and Sarcocystis species.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
When administered with trimethoprim sulfonamide combinations, anemia has
been observed. Folic or folinic acid has been supplemented to prevent anemia,
but benefit of this treatment is unclear.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not administer to animals that may be prone to anemia or in which a CBC
cannot be monitored.
Drug Interactions
 Drug interactions are not reported for animals. However, a combination of
 pyrimethamine with trimethoprim/sulfonamides will enhance the bone marrow
toxicity.
Instructions for Use
Use of pyrimethamine sulfadiazine has been primarily for treatment of protozoal
infections in horses. However, there is anecdotal evidence that pyrimethamine +
sulfadiazine may be indicated for treatment of some protozoa (e.g., Toxoplasma,
Neosporn, or Sarcocystis) in small animals.

Quinidine, Quinidine Sulfate
Kwin-ih-deen
Trade and Other Names: Quinidine gluconate: Quiniglute, Duraquin and
Quinidine polygalacturonate: Cardioquin, and Quinidine sulfate: Cin-Quin, and
Quinora
Functional Classification: Antiarrhythmic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antiarrhythmic drug. Class I antiarrhythmic. Like other Class I antiarrhythmic
drugs, its action is to inhibit sodium influx via blockade of sodium channels.
Therefore it suppreses cardiac Phase O action potential and decreases ectopic
arrhythmic foci.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Quinidine is used to treat ventricular arrhythmias and occasionally to convert atrial
fibrillation to sinus rhythm. In small animals it is rarely used because there are other
more effective and safer alternatives available. In horses and cattle, quinidine has
been the drug of choice to treat atrial fibrillation. However, other alternatives
are considered because of frequency of adverse effects in horses and decreased
availability of commercial foms of quinidine. Alternatives include diltiazem and
electrical cardioversion.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Side effects with quinidine are more common than procainamide and include
nausea and vomiting. Adverse effects include hypotension and tachycardia
(because of vagolytic effect). With intravenous dosing, adverse effects such as
hypotension and tachyarrhythmias are common in cattle. In horses, adverse
Q
supraventricular tachycardia. Sudden cardiac death is possible but uncommon in
horses.
Contraindications and Precautions
Quinidine may increase heart rate. Use cautiously in animals with heart disease.
Drug Interactions
Quinidine is a well-known multidrug resistance (MDRl) membrane pump
(P-glycoprotein) inhibitor. It will interfere with membrane channels and increase
P-glycoprotein substrates.
Instructions for Use
Quinidine has a rapid clearance in cattle (half-life is 2.25 hours), which results in the
need for frequent administration. Equine doses are usually administered orally via
stomach tube. Because of decreased availability of commercial forms and frequency
of adverse effects, quinidine is not used as commonly as other Class I antiarrhythmic
dnugs. If quinidine is administered, calculate the dose to the amount of quinidine
base in each formulation: 324 mg of quinidine gluconate has a 202-mg quinidine

base; 275 of mg quinidine polygalacturonate has a 167-mg quinidine base; 300 mg
of quinidine sulfate has a 250-mg quinidine base.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Quinidine can be hypotensive and vagolytic. Monitor patient's ECG for arrhythmias
and monitor blood pressure.
Formulations
In some countries, quinidine is being discontinued and may be diffcult to obtain.
 Older fomulations include quinidine gluconate 324-mg tablets and 80-mg/mL
injection; quinidine polygalacturonate in 275-mg tablets; and quinidine sulfate in
100-, 200-, and 300-mg tablets, 200- and 300-mg capsules, and 200-mg/mL
injection.
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature.
Quinidine is slightly soluble in water. Quinidine salts may form a dark color when
exposed to light and should not be used. Quinidine has been compounded for oral
use in syrups (e.g., Ora-Sweet) and is stable for 60 days.

678 Ramipril
Ramipril
ram'ih-pril 
Trade and Other Names: Vasotop
 Functional Classification: Vasodilator, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
inhibitor
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Like other ACE inhibitors, ramipril inhibits conversion of angiotensin I to
sympathetic stimulation, renal hypertension, and synthesis of aldosterone. The ability
of aldosterone to cause sodium and water retention contributes to congestion.
Ramipril, like other ACE inhibitors, will cause vasodilation and decrease aldosterone-
 induced congestion. ACE inhibitors also contribute to vasodilation by increasing
concentrations of some vasodilating kinins and prostaglandins. There is evidence for
a cardioprotective effect when used to treat dogs with heart disease caused by
cardiomyopathy or valvular disease.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Ramipril is used to treat hypertension and congestive heart failure (CHF). It has
not been studied as much as other ACE inhibitors in animals (e.g., enalapril or
benazepril), but it is expected to have similar pharmacodynamic effects. It has been
primarily used in dogs. It has also been used safely in cats to control hypertension
but has not been effective for treating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
It has not been used as often as other drugs in this class; therefore, a full range
of potential adverse effects has not been reported. Ramipril was well tolerated in
clinical studies in dogs.
Contraindications and Precautions
necessary when administering ramipril in dogs with impaired renal function.
 Discontinue use of ACE inhibitors in pregnant animals; they cross the placenta
and have caused fetal malformations and death of the fetus.
Drug Interactions
Use cautiously with other hypotensive drugs and diuretics. Nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may decrease vasodilating effects.
Instructions for Use
Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in dogs with dilated cardiomyopathy. Other
drugs used for treatment of heart failure may be used concurrently. Dogs also may
receive pimobendan, digoxin and/or furosemide with ramipril.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor patients carefilly to avoid hypotension. With all ACE inhibitors, monitor
thereafter.

Ranitidine Hydrochloride
rah-nit'ih-deen hye-droe-klor'ide
Trade and Other Names: Zantac
Functional Classification: Antiulcer agent
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Histamine2 antagonist (H blocker). Ranitidine, like other H blockers, suppresses
histamine stimulation of gastric parietal cell to decrease gastric acid secretion.
Ranitidine will increase stomach pH. Ranitidine is longer acting and 4 to l0 times
more potent than cimetidine. The half-life of ranitidine is longer than cimetidine,
which results in decreased frequency of administration for ranitidine. When adjusting
doses, ranitidine hydrochloride is 89% ranitidine.
Indications and Clinical Uses
R
 Ranitidine is used to treat ulcers and gastritis. It does not produce as much of a
sustained increase in stomach pH as proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole).
Ranitidine (6.6 mg/kg PO) in foals suppressed acid for 6 hours, but omeprazole
suppressed acid for 22 hours at 4 mg/kg. It is used to prevent nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced ulcers in animals, although efficacy
has not been demonstrated for this effect. In horses, ranitidine did not improve
healing of ulcers induced by NSAIDs, and it was not as effective as omeprazole
for treating ulcers. Ranitidine may stimulate stomach emptying and colon
motility via anticholinesterase action. In horses, the effect on gastric emptying is
minimal.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects are usually seen only with decreased renal clearance. In people,
CNS signs may occur with high doses. Ranitidine may have fewer effects on
endocnine function and drug interactions compared to cimetidine.
680RanitidineHydrochloride
Contraindications and Precautions
 Fewer drug interactions are possible with ranitidine compared to cimetidine
because ranitidine does not inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Drug Interactions
Ranitidine and other Hz-receptor blockers block secretion of stomach acid.
Therefore, they will interfere with oral absorption of drugs dependent on acidity,
such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, and iron supplements. Unlike cimetidine,
ranitidine is not known to inhibit microsomal P450 enzymes.
Instructions for Use
less often than cimetidine to achieve continuous suppression of stomach acid
secretion. Use in horses and foals is based on experimental studies and
pharmacokinetic data.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
No specific monitoring is necessary.
Formulations
Ranitidine is available in 75-, 150-, and 300-mg tablets; 50- and 300-mg capsules;
and 25-mg/mL injection. Some forms are available over the counter (OTC).
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature.

Remifentanil Hydrochloride 681
Remifentanil Hydrochloride
Rem-i-fen'  ta-nil
Trade and Other Names: Ultiva
Functional Classification: Anesthetic, analgesic, opioid
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Remifentanil is a potent opioid similar in potency and activity to fentanyl. Like
fentanyl, remifentanil has activity primarily at the mu-opiate receptor. The difference
between remifentanil and other opioids is that it has an ultrashort action. The rapid
disposition. Remifentanil is quickly metabolized by hydrolysis of the propanoic
acid-methyl ester by blood and tissue esterases. Therefore it is rapidly metabolized
in the blood, does not depend on liver metabolism, and can be used safely in
patients with liver or kidney disease. It also is rapidly delivered to tissues with an
octanol:water partition coefficient of 17.9 at pH 7.3. However, it does not
accumulate in tissues or blood even after prolonged IV infusions. Because of the
has a fast onset of activity after IV injection. The half-life in dogs is approximately
3-6 minutes and does not change with increasing doses. Recovery occurs rapidly
(within 5 to l0 minutes), and when using constant rate infusions, new steady-state
rate. Because of rapid equilibration with tissues, it can be casily titrated to the
desired depth of anesthesia/analgesia by changing the continuous infusion rate or by
administering an IV bolus injection.
Indications and Clinical Uses
 Remifentanil is used as an anesthetic agent, often in combination with other agents.
Because of its rapid metabolism and short half life, it should be administered via
constant rate infusion (CRI) to maintain a balanced anesthetic effect. It is used for
induction and maintenance of anesthesia. It can be administered with other drugs,
including inhalant anesthetics, alpha-2 agonists, sedatives, and tranquilizers. Because
it does not require hepatic metabolism or renal elimination, it can be administered
R
safely to patients that have liver or kidney disease. Remifentanil use in dogs is
from humans (human starting dose is 0.l mcg/kg/min CRI). Remifentanil has
been infused safely in cats, and over a wide range of doses (0.06-16 mcg/kg/min)
IV it did not affect isoflurane MAC.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Like other opioids and opiates, remifentanil has adverse effects that are attributed
to the binding to opiate receptors. These effects include reduced heart rate and
occurs. In cats, remifentanil induced dysphoria at high infusion rates
(>8 mcg/kg/min). Adverse effects will quickly dissipate when the infusion is
discontinued because of the drug's rapid metabolism in the plasma and tissues
The opioid activity of remifentanil is antagonized by opioid antagonists such as
naloxone.
682Remifentanil Hydrochloride
Contraindications and Precautions
Remifentanil will potentiate the effects of other anesthetics. Use cautiously in
animals sensitive to opiates.
Drug Interactions
Other anesthetics will be potentiated when used with remifentanil. Lower doses
of other anesthetic agents may be used when combined with remifentanil.
Instructions for Use
Administer IV as a constant rate infusion (CRI).
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor patients during anesthetic protocol. Monitor ECG, heart rate, and
breathing character.
Formulations
Remifentanil is available in a l-mg/mL solution and in vials of 1, 2, or 5 mg of
remifentanil base. Add l mL of diluent per milligram of remifentanil to produce a
solution of l mg/mL. This solution can be fuirther diluted for intravenous use to a
concentration of 20, 25, 50, or 250 mcg/mL.
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature.
Remifentanil HCl has a pKa of 7.07, but the pH of reconstituted solutions ranges
from 2.5 to 3.5. The pH of solutions should be considered when combining with
other drugs or fluid solutions. Remifentanil is compatible with sterile water, lactated
Ringer's solution, 5% dextrose, 0.9% sodium chloride, and 0.45% sodium chloride.
Once mixed in solution, it is stable for 4 hours at room temperature. It can be

Regulatory Information
Because of the low risk of harmful residues in animals intended for food, no
withdrawal time is necessary.
Rifampin
rih-fam'pin 
Trade and Other Names: Rifadin, Rimactane, and Rifampicin
Functional Classification: Antibacterial
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antibacterial. Action of nifampin is to inhibit bacterial RNA synthesis. Rifampin is a
smisynthetic antibiotic derived from rifamycin B to produce rifampin (US and
Canadian name), also known as rifampicin in Europe. Rifampin has a high activity
against gram-positive bacteria (Staplylococcws spp.), Mycobacterium spp., Haemophilus
SPP., Neisseria spp., and Chlamydin spp. but more limited activity against the
gram-negative bacteria because it penetrates the gram-positive organism cell wall
d A s d lm   - ar  a a
soluble and has the characteristic of entering cells to concentrate in leukocytes to
inhibit intracellular bacteria. This is a therapeutic advantage for treating intracellular
organisms(Brucella,Mycobacterium,Rhodococcus, Chlamydia)and chronic
granulomatous diseases. Rifampin enters the microbial cell and forms stable
complexes with the beta subunit of DNA-dependent RNA polymerases of micro-
organisms. This binding results in inactive enzymes and inhibition of RNA synthesis
by preventing chain initiation. Resistance occurs via a single mutation of the amino
acid sequence of the beta subunit of the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzyme.
Rifampin is rapidly absorbed from the GI tract after oral administration in humans,
dogs, calves, horses, and foals. Pharmacokinetics in adult horses shows rapid oral
absorption of nifampin and a half-life of approximately 5-7 hours and a volume of
distribution (VD) of 0.7 L/kg, but the half-life is longer in foals at approximately
18 hours. The half-life in dogs is approximately 8 hours.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Rifampin is used in people primarily for treatment of tuberculosis. In veterinary
medicine, rifampin has been used to treat susceptible gram-positive and intracellular
bacteria, including Staphylococcws species (including methicillin-resistant strains);
Streptococcns spp.;Rhodococcus equi,Corynebacterinm psendotnberenlosis,and most
strains of Bacteroides spP, Clostridium spp, Neisserin spP., and Listerin spp.
Gram-negative organisms are not affected at typical doses. In small animals, it is
occasionally used to treat staphylococcal infections, particularly methicillin-resistant
develop rapidly, but this has not been well-documented among veterinary isolates.
Nevertheless, to prevent the emergence of resistance, many clinicians advise using
nifampin in conjunction with another antibiotic to decrease the emergence of
resistant strains. One of the most common uses of rifampin is for treating infections
caused by Rhodococcns eqwi in horses. For this treatment, it is frequently combined
with erythromycin, azithromycin, or clarithromycin. Rifampin also may have activity
against bacteria in biofilms. However, there are insuffcient reports to confirm the
clinical effectiveness for treating biofilm bacteria.
Rifampin 685
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
higher). Hepatic enzyme elevations may be observed. Urine will be colored
orange to reddish-orange in treated patients. It will also discolor saliva, tears,
feces, sclera, and mucous membranes to a reddish-orange color. Rifampin is
unpalatable and may be difficult to administer to some animals. Pancreatitis has
been associated with rifampin administration.
Contraindications and Precautions
When administered with other drugs, consideration for more rapid elimination
of other drugs should be considered. Use cautiously in animals that are at risk
for pancreatitis. Because of risk of hepatitis, use cautiously with any other drug
acetaminophen). Avoid use in pregnant animals.
Drug Interactions
Multiple drug interactions are possible. Rifampin is a potent inducer of
cytochrome P450 hepatic enzymes. Drugs that may have decreased levels when
administered with rifampin include barbiturates, chloramphenicol, progestins,
digitalis, warfarin, corticosteroids, and potentially many other drugs concurrently
administered with rifampin. Rifampin is also an inducer of membrane eflux
pump (P-glycoprotein), which may have the consequence of decreasing oral
absorption of other drugs.
Instructions for Use
Most of the documented clinical experience has been in horses when rifampin was
combined with a macrolide antibiotic for use in foals. When selecting a dose, the
10 mg/kg PO dose was adequate for susceptible gram-positive infections in the
adult horse. Use in small animals (and doses) is based on experience in people or
anecdotal experience in animals. It is often administered in combination with other
R
drugs to decrease emergence of resistance. Administer on an empty stomach
whenever possible.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Susceptibility testing: CLSI break point for sensitive organisms is <l.0 mcg/mL.
MICs for gram-positive organisms generally occur at 0.1 mcg/mL, whereas gram
negatives have MIC values ranging from 8 to 32 mcg/mL.
Formulations
Rifampin is available in 150-mg and 300-mg capsules and 600-mg Rifadin IV
injectable solution.
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature.
Rifampin is slightly soluble in water and ethanol. It is more soluble at acidic pH.
Acid should be added to solutions (e.g., ascorbic acid) to prevent oxidation and
improve solubility. Rifampin has been mixed with syrups and flavorings for oral
administration and was stable for 4-6 weeks. The injectable solution is prepared by
adding 10 mL of saline to a 600-mg vial and mixing (60 mg/mL). It may be

Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Intravenous solution for fluid replacement. Ringer's solution contains 147 mEq/L
sodium, 4 mEq/L potassium, 155 mEq/L chloride, and 4 mEq/L calcium.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Ringer's solution is used as a fluid replacement and for maintenance. It has a
balanced electrolyte concentration, but it does not contain any bases (see Lactated
Ringer's for solutions that contain bases).
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Ringer's solution is considered an acidifying solution because with prolonged
administration the chlonide will increase renal excretion of bicarbonate. Fluid
overload occurs at high infusion rates.
Contraindications and Precautions
 Do not exceed fluid rates of 80 mL/kg/hr. Consider supplementing with
potassium because this fluid will not meet maintenance potassium needs.
Drug Interactions
 Ringer's solution contains calcium; do not mix with drugs that may bind to
calcium.
Romifidine Hydrochloride 687
Instructions for Use
When administering intravenous fluid solution, monitor rate and electrolyte
concentrations carefully. Add bicarbonate to fluids, if necessary, based on calculation
of base deficit.
Fluid administration rates are as follows: normal maintenance rates: 40-65 mL/
kg/24 hr (approximately 2-2.5 mL/kg/hr). For replacement fluid use the following
calculation:
Liters needed = % dehydration × body weight (kg)
10
mL needed = % dehydration × body weight (kg) × 1000
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor pulmonary pressure when infusing high doses. Monitor electrolyte balance,
especially potassium during treatment.

Romifidine Hydrochloride
roe-mif"ih-deen hye-droe-klor'ide
Trade and Other Names: Sedivet
Functional Classification: Analgesic, alphaz-agonist
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Alphaz-adrenergic agonist. Alphaz-agonists decrease release of neurotransmitters from
the neuron. The proposed mechanism whereby they decrease transmission is via
688 Romifidine Hydrochloride
binding to presynaptic alpha2 receptors (negative feedback receptors). The result is
decreased sympathetic outflow, analgesia, sedation, and anesthesia. Romifidine is
structurally similar to clonidine. Other drugs in this class include xylazine,
detomidine, dexmedetomidine, and medetomidine. Medetomidine,
dexmedetomidine, romifidine, and detomidine are more specific for the alpha2
receptor than xylazine. Romifidine has an onset of effect of 2 minutes and a
duration of l-1.5 hours.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Romifidine, like other alpha2-agonists, is used as a sedative, anesthetic adjunct, and
for analgesia. Romifidine produces the longest duration of sedative effects, followed
by detomidine, medetomidine, and xylazine. Its use is primarily limited to horses
in which it is used as a sedative and analgesic to facilitate handling, clinical
examinations, clinical procedures, and minor surgical procedures and for use as a
preanesthetic prior to the induction of general anesthesia.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Romifidine, like other alpha2-agonists, decreases sympathetic output. Bradycardia
 is common and cardiovascular depression may occur. Cardiac effects can include
sinoatrial block, first-degree and second-degree AV block, bradycardia, and sinus
arrhythmia. In horses it causes effects similar to other alphaz-agonists, including
ataxia, head drooping, sweating, and bradycardia. Facial edema is common,
especially with higher doses. Even at at high doses in experimental horses (up to
600 mcg/kg), there were no deaths.
Contraindications and Precautions
Romifdine, like other alphaz-agonists, should be used cautiously in animals with
heart disease. Use may be contraindicated in older animals with pre-existing
cardiac disease. Xylazine causes problems in pregnant animals, and this also
should be considered for other alpha2-agonists. Use cautiously in animals that are
 pregnant; it may induce labor. In addition, it may decrease oxygen delivery to the
fetus in late gestation. In case of overdose, reverse with atipamezole or
yohimbine.
Drug Interactions
Do not use with other drugs that may cause cardiac depression. It may be used
 in horses with diazepam or ketamine. Do not mix in vial or syringe with other
anesthetics. Use with opioid analgesic drugs will greatly enhance the CNS
depression. Consider lowering doses if administered with opioids.
Instructions for Use
Romifidine, like other alphaz-agonists, can be administered with ketamine or
benzodiazepines. It can be reversed with alphaz-antagonists such as atipamezole or
yohimbine. A range of doses is used in horses for romifidine; 40 and 120 mcg/kg
IV have been compared, which showed that sedation, cardiac effects, and analgesia
are all dose-dependent effects. Deeper sedation occurs with higher doses. Each dose
produced effects for at least 60 minutes, and some were observed for l80 minutes.
Duration of 180 minutes is more likely with higher doses.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor vital signs during anesthesia. Monitor heart rate, blood pressure, and ECG
if possible during anesthesia.

Ronidazole
roe'nid'ah-zole
Trade and Other Names: Generic
Functional Classification: Antibacterial, antiparasitic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antibacterial and antiprotozoal drug. It is a nitroimidazole in which the activity
involves generation of free nitroradicals via metabolism within protozoa and bacteria.
Ronidazole disrupts DNA in an organism via reaction with intracellular metabolite.
Its action is specific for anaerobic bacteria and protozoa. Like other nitroimidazoles,
it is active against some protozoa, including Trichomonns, and Giardin, and
intestinal protozoal parasites. After oral administration in cats, it was rapidly and
completely absorbed. The half-life in cats is approximately l0 hours.
Indications and Clinical Uses
R
Ronidazole is currently not a registered drug, but it has been used in cats to treat
intestinal protozoal parasites. Studies for treatment of other organisms are not
available. For treatment of feline Tritricbomonas foetns intestinal infections, it
Pharmacokinetic data indicate that 30 mg/kg, once daily, may be equally effective,
but this dose has not been tested for effcacy. Effcacy for long-tem remission has
not been established, but temporary resolution of feline Tritrichomonas foetus
intestinal infections has been observed.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Like other nitroimidazoles, the most severe adverse effect is caused by toxicity
to CNS. High doses may cause lethargy, CNS depression, ataxia, tremors,
hyperesthesia, seizures, vomiting, and weakness. The CNS signs are related to
inhibition of action of GABA and are responsive to benzodiazepines (diazepam).
Adverse CNS effects are dose related. Dogs show neurotoxicity at doses of
690   Ronidazole
mutagenic changes in cells, but this has not been demonstrated in vivo. Like
other nitroimidazoles, it has a bitter taste and can cause vomiting and anorexia.
Contraindications and Precautions
Fetal abnormalities have not been demonstrated in animals with recommended
doses, but use cautiously during pregnancy.
Drug Interactions
Like other nitroimidazoles, it may potentiate the effects of warfarin and
cyclosporine via inhibition of drug metabolism.
Instructions for Use
Ronidazole is currently not a marketed drug but has been prepared from bulk
powder in compounding pharmacies.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor for neurologic adverse effects.
Formulations
 No available formulation exists; it is compounded from bulk chemical. Intravenous
formulations have been prepared by dissolving ronidazole pure powder in 5%
dextrose in water (D5W) to a concentration of 3.2 mg/ml. This formulation has
been safely administered to research animals.
Stability and Storage

S-Adenosylmethionine (SAMe)
ess'ah-den'oh-sill-meh-thye'oh-neen
Trade and Other Names: Denosyl, Denamarin, and SAMe
Functional Classification: Nutritional supplement
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Nutritional supplement. S-Adenosylmethionine, usually abbreviated as SAMe, is
found naturally and is formed from methionine and ATP. It has been associated
been beneficial according to isolated reports in veterinary medicine. It serves as a
methyl donor, catalyzed by methyltransferase. It also is a substrate for a
transsulfuration reaction in which demethylated SAMe is metabolized to glutathione
(GSH). Glutathione may conjugate certain drug metabolites to enhance excretion.
Cats and dogs have low levels of GSH, and SAMe may help restore GSH in animals
that have been intoxicated and perhaps in animals that have liver disease. It is a
methyl donor for neurotransmitter metabolism in the synthesis and turnover of
biogenic monoamines (CNS neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, and
norepinephrine). In dogs, the half-life after oral administration is approximately 2
hours.
Indications and Clinical Uses

Selamectin
sel-ah-mek'tin
Trade and Other Names: Revolution
Functional Classification: Antiparasitic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antiparasitic. Microflaricide for heartworm prevention in dogs and cats. Selamectin
is a semisynthetic avermectin. Avermectins (ivermectin-like drugs) and milbemycins
(milbemycin, doramectin, and moxidectin) are macrocyclic lactones. Avermectins
and macrocyclic lactones share similanities, including mechanism of action. These
channels in parasites. Paralysis and death of the parasite are caused by increased
 permeability to chloride ions and hyperpolarization of nerve cells. These drugs also
potentiate other chloride channels, including ones gated by GABA. Mammals
ordinarily are not affected because they lack glutamate-gated chloride channels, and
there is a lower affinity for other mammalian chloride channels. Because these drugs
ordinarily do not penetrate the blood-brain barrier, GABA-gated channels in the
CNS of mammals are not affected. After topical application selamectin has high
affinity for sebaceous glands and skin. The terminal half-life of selamectin is ll days
in dogs and 8 days in cats.
Selegiline Hydrochloride  693

Selegiline Hydrochloride
se-leh'jeh-leen hye-droe-klor'ide
Trade and Other Names: Anipryl (also known as deprenyl and l-deprenyl),
Eldepryl (human preparation), and Emsam transdermal patch
Functional Classification: Dopamine agonist
694Selegiline Hydrochloride
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Dopamine agonist. Selegiline has been known by many names. Selegiline
hydrochlonide is the official USP drug name, but most clinicians know it by the
older name, l-deprenyl. (l-deprenyl is distinguished from its steroisomer d-deprenyl.)
A related drug is rasagiline. Selegiline has been used in humans for treatment of
Parkinson's disease and occasionally for Alzheimer's disease with the trade name
Eldepryl. (Efficacy for Alzheimer's disease has not been established.)
(and other MAOs at higher doses). The proposed mechanism of action is
to inhibit the metabolism of dopamine in the central nervous system. The action
for pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism may be through increased dopamine
levels in the brain, which decreases ACTH release, resulting in lower cortisol levels.
Secondary effects are related to inhibition of the metabolism of phenylethylamine
(Phenylethylamine in laboratory animals produces amphetamine-like effects.) Two
active metabolites are l-amphetamine and l-methamphetamine, but it is not known
to what extent these contribute to pharmacologic effects. In horses, the metabolism
to amphetamine-like metabolites is low.
Indications and Clinical Uses
In dogs, selegiline is approved to control clinical signs of pituitary-dependent
hyperadrenocorticism (PDH; Cushing's disease) and to treat cognitive dysfunction
in older dogs. However, the efficacy for Cushing's disease may not be as high as for
other drugs such as mitotane or trilostane. Selegiline effects may be limited PDH
caused by lesions of the pars intermedia and may not be effective for other forms of
PDH (most cases of canine PDH have lesions of the pars distalis). It may improve
   s  sia n   s  n
1.0 mg/kg once daily. For canine cognitive dysfunction (dementia) in old
dogs, treatment with selegiline inhibits MAO type B and increases dopamine
concentrations in the brain, which restores dopamine and balance and may improve
cognitive ability. It has been administered to some older cats with age-related
behavior problems, but clinical results in cats have not been reported. It does not
appear to produce any clinical effects in horses from oral administration.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects are rare in dogs but have included vomiting, diarrhea, and
hyperactive and restless behavior. Amphetamine-like signs can be produced in
experimental animals. At high doses in dogs, hyperactivity has been observed
(doses >3 mg/kg) that included salivation, panting, repetitive movements,
decreased weight, and changes in activity level. At doses of 30 mg per horse IV
or oral, there were no behavior effects.
Two active metabolites are l-amphetamine and l-methamphetamine. Even
though there were increases in amphetamine concentrations in dogs, they were not
high enough to produce adverse effects. However, at high doses (>3 mg/kg) it
may produce behavioral changes. The l-isomer metabolites are not as active as their
d-forms, and studies have not supported a potential for amphetamine-like abuse or
dependency from selegiline compared with other amphetamine-like drugs.
Contraindications and Precautions
Not indicated for adrenal tumors. Use cautiously with other drugs. (See the
following list of interactions.)
Senna 695

Sevoflurane
see-voe-floo'rane
Trade and Other Names: Aerrane
Functional Classification: Anesthetic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Inhalant anesthetic. Like other inhalant anesthetics, the mechanism of action is
Wmcertain. Sevoflurane produces a generalized, reversible depression of the CNS.
The inhalant anesthetics vary in their solubility in blood, their potency, and the rate
Sevoflurane 697
of induction and recovery. Those with low blood/gas partition coefficients are
associated with the most rapid rates of induction and recovery. Sevoflurane has a
vapor pressure of 160 mm Hg (at 20°C), a blood/gas partition coefficient of 0.65,
and a fat/blood coeffcient of 48. Sevoflurane is similar to isoflurane in many
respects, except that it has lower solubility, resulting in faster induction and recovery
times.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Sevoflurane is used as an inhalant anesthetic. There are not any significant
advantages over the use of isoflurane and it is more expensive than isoflurane. It has
a minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) value of 2.58%, 2.36%, and 2.31% in cats,
dogs, and horses, respectively. Sevoflurane, like other inhalant anesthetics, can be
used with preanesthetics, opioids, alpha-2 agonists, and tranquilizers.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects are related to anesthetic effects (e.g., cardiovascular and
respiratory depression). Sevoflurane can produce byproducts of fluonide ions and
Compound A, which can be toxic to the kidneys.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not use unless there is an adequate facility to monitor patients.
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions have been reported for animals.
Instructions for Use
 Use of inhalant anesthetics requires careful monitoring. Dose is determined by
depth of anesthesia.

698 Sildenafil Citrate
Sildenafil Citrate
sill-den'-ah-fil
Trade and Other Names: Viagra, Revatio
Functional Classification: Vasodilator
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Vasodilator. Sildenafl is a vasodilator, specific for phosphodiesterase V. Sildenafl
and similar drugs act to increase cyclic GMP by inhibiting its breakdown by
phosphodiesterase-V (PDE-V). There are two important locations of
phosphodiesterase V: (1) vascular smooth muscle of the lungs, and (2) corpus
cavernosum. The second effect produces the desired clinical effects that have caused
the popularity in human medicine. The effect on vascular smooth muscle of the
lungs produces vasodilation of the pulmonary vascular bed in patients with
pulmonary hypertension. Other drugs that have been used for this effect are tadalafil
(Cialis) at a dose of 1-2 mg/kg ql2h PO in dogs.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Sildenafil and related drugs are used in people for treating erectile dysfunction via
the effect on the corpus cavernosum. This effect has not been explored in veterinary
medicine. The use in veterinary medicine has been limited to the treatment of
patients with pulmonary hypertension.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Cutaneous flushing of the inguinal area has been observed in dogs. Otherwise,
adverse effects have not been reported with clinical use in dogs. Potential effects
are attributed to the vasodilator action. If high doses or other vasodilators are
administered—especially those that increase cyclic-GMP levels—hypotension can
occur.
Contraindications and Precautions
Use cautiously in conjunction with other vasodilator drugs.
Drug Interactions
 No drug interactions reported for animals, but in people there are precautions
about use with other vasodilators such as alpha blockers and nitrates
Instructions for Use
The use in veterinary medicine has been based on studies in dogs with pulmonary
hypertension. The dosages and clinical use are based on these limited reports.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
 No specific monitoring is necessary, but monitor the patient's cardiovascular function
(blood pressure and heart rate) in animals at risk for cardiovascular complications.
Formulations
Sildenafil is available as 20-, 25-, 50-, and 100-mg tablets.
Stability and Storage

Silymarin
sill-ih-mare'in 
Trade and Other Names: Silybin, Marin, Milk Thistle, and generic brands
Functional Classification: Hepatic protectant
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Silymarin contains silybin as the most active ingredient. It is also known as milk
thistle, from which it is derived. Silymarin is a mixture of antihepatotoxic
flavonolignans (derived from the plant silybum). Silymarin has three components that
are considered flavonolignans: silidianin, silcristin, and silybin (which is the major
component and also called silymarin and silibinin). Silymarin has been used for the
treatment of a variety of liver disorders in humans. The mechanism of silymarin's
action is thought to be as an antioxidant inhibiting both peroxidation of lipid
membranes and glutathione oxidation. Experimental data have supported the 
hepatoprotective properties of silymarin as an antioxidant and a free radical scavenger.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Silymarin has been used to treat hepatic disease, including hepatotoxic reactions in
people and animals. In cats it may provide antioxidant activity. Silymarin is used as a
complementary treatment in canine and feline liver disease. However, there is no
scientific information on the oral absorption, correct dose, or evidence of effcacy of
silymarin treatment. Silymarin can be used with S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe)
There are preparations that include both silymarin and SAMe (Denamarin).

Sodium Bicarbonate
Trade and Other Names: Baking soda, Soda mint, Citrocarbonate, and Arm &
Hammer pure baking soda
Functional Classification: Alkalinizing agent
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Alkalizing agent. Antacid. It increases plasma and urinary concentrations of
bicarbonate. One gram sodium bicarbonate is equal to 12 mEq sodium and
bicarbonate ions; 3.65 g sodium bicarbonate is equal to 1 g sodium.
Indications and Clinical Uses
 Sodium bicarbonate is a typical alkalinizing solution. It is the most frequent
alkalinizing solution used for intravenous therapy of systemic acidosis and to treat
severe hyperkalemia. When adding to fluid therapy, the goal is to maintain PaCO2
within 37-43 mm Hg. It also has been administered to alkalize urine.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects have been attributed to alkalizing activity. Hypokalemia may
occur with excessive administration. Hyperosmolality, hypernatremia, paradoxical
CNS, and intracellular acidosis may occur.
Sodium Bicarbonate 701
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not administer to animals with hypocalcemia (may exacerbate tetany). Do not
administer to animals with excessive chloride loss because of vomiting. Do not
administer to animals with alkalosis. Administration of sodium bicarbonate may
increase risk of hypernatremia, paradoxical CNS acidosis, and hyperosmolality.
Drug Interactions
Sodium bicarbonate should not be mixed with drugs that require an acidic
medium for stability and solubility. Such drugs may include solutions containing
hydrochloride (HCl) salts. When mixing intravenous solutions, do not mix
bicarbonate with solutions containing calcium (chelation may result). When
administered orally, interaction may occur to decrease absorption of other drugs
(partial list includes anticholinergic drugs, ketoconazole, fluoroquinolones, and
tetracyclines).
Instructions for Use
When used for systemic acidosis, doses should be adjusted on the basis of blood gas
measurements or assessment of acidosis. The following cquation may be used to
estimate requirement:
mEq Bicarbonate =body weight (kg) ×base deficit (mEq/L)x 0.3.
Initially, administer 25%-50% of this dose in intravenous fluids over 20-30
minutes. In calves or neonates, use a factor of 0.5 instead of 0.3. Twelve mEq of
bicarbonate = 1 g of sodium bicarbonate. Note: 1.4% solution = 0.17 mEq/mL and
provides 13 g of bicarbonate per L. 8.5 % solution = 1 mEq/mL of NaHCO. One
teaspoon of baking soda is approximately 2 g of NaHCOs. When used during
cardiac resuscitation, caution is advised because of risk of hyperosmolality,
hypernatremia, and paradoxical CNS acidosis.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor acid-base status.
Formulations
Sodium bicarbonate is available in 325-, 520-, and 650-mg tablets. Per teaspoonful
(3.9 g) of Citrocarbonate, there is 780 mg sodium bicarbonate and 1l.82 grams
sodium citrate. It is also available in injections of various strengths: 4.2% is
S
0.5 mEq/mL (11.5 mg/mL sodium) and 8.4% is 1 mEq/mL (23 mg/mL
sodium).
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container at room temperature. Alkaline solution with
pH of 7-8.5. Do not mix with acid solutions. Sodium bicarbonate is soluble in
water. If exposed to air, it may decompose to sodium carbonate, which is more
alkaline.

Sotalol Hydrochloride
soe'tah-lole hye-droe-kloride
Trade and Other Names: Betapace
Functional Classification: Beta blocker, antiarrhythmic
s
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Nonspecific beta-receptor (Betaj and Betaz) adrenergic blocker (Class II
antiarrhythmic). Action is similar to propranolol (one-third potency); however, its
beneficial effect may be caused more by the other antiarrhythmic effects. In addition
to being a Class II antiarrhythmic drug, sotalol may have some Class III (potassium-
channel-blocking) activity. The Class II activity prolongs the refractory period by
decreasing potassium conduction in delayed rectifier currents. Sotalol is a water-
soluble beta blocker and relies less on the liver for clearance than other beta
blockers. Plasma levels and interindividual differences in clearance are expected to be
less than other beta blockers.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Sotalol is indicated for control of refractory ventricular arrhythmias. It has also been
used for refractory atrial fibrillation. Although sotalol is commonly administered to
small animals, particularly dogs, the use and doses are derived primarily from
anecdotal and clinical experience.
706Sotalol Hydrochloride
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects have not been reported for animals but are expected to be similar
to propranolol. Like many antiarrhythmics, sotalol may have some proarrhythmic
activity. Negative inotropic effects may cause concem in some animals with poor
cardiac contractility.
Contraindications and Precautions
Administer cautiously to patients with heart failure or atrioventricular block. Use
cautiously in patients with poor cardiac reserve.
Drug Interactions
Use cautiously with other drugs that may decrease cardiac contractility or lower
heart rate.
Instructions for Use
The beta-blocking effects occur at low doses; Class IlI antiarrhythmic effects occur
at higher doses. In people, it may be a more effective maintenance agent for
controlling arrhythmias than other drugs.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor heart rate during treatment.
Formulations
Sotalol is available in 80-, 120-, 160-, and 240-mg tablets.
Stability and Storage
 Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature.

Spectinomycin, Spectinomycin Dihydrochloride
Pentahydrate
spek-tih-noe-mye'sin
Trade and Other Names: Spectam, Spectogard, Prospec, and Adspec
Functional Classification: Antibiotic, aminocyclitol
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Spectinomycin is an aminocyclitol antibiotic, which shares similar features with an
aminoglycoside. However, it differs in that it does not contain amino sugars or
glycosidic bonds. It has a broad spectrum of activity. It is highly water soluble and is
easily mixed in aqueous solutions. Spectinomycin, like aminoglycosides, inhibits
activity against gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria, and mycoplasma but
little anaerobic activity. It is not absorbed orally but is administered either in
drinking water for treatment of enteritis or by injection for other infections. After
injection the half-life in animals is 1-2 hours.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Spectinomycin has in vitro activity against some gram-negative bacteria and has also
been administered orally for treatment of bacteria enteritis caused by E. coli and as
cattle to treat respiratory infections caused by Pastewrella, Mannbeimin, and
Histophilus somni (formerly Haemophilus somnns). It also has activity against
Mycopiasma. It has been used in dogs but not commonly. Spectinomycin has been
withdrawn by the original drug sponsor and may not be commercially available.

Spinosad
Spin-oh'-sad
Trade and Other Names: Comfortis
Functional Classification: Antiparasitic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Spinosad is a member of the spinosyns class of insecticides. These resemble
tetracycline macrolides but are not antibactenial. Spinosad is a combination of
spinosyn A and spinosyn D, derived from bacteria (Saccharopolyspora spinosa). The
action of spinosad in fleas is activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors but not
other nicotinic receptors or GABA receptors. The actions in insects treated with
spinosad are muscle contractions and tremors in motor neurons, paralysis, and flea
death. It does not affect mammals because of differences in the suseptibility of
micotinic acetylcholine receptors.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Spinosad is used as a monthly treatment for flea infestations. After administration,
pinosad can kill fleas within 30 minutes and has complete kill within 4 hours.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
 In safety studies, administration of high doses (l00 mg/kg once daily for 10
days) did not produce any serious adverse effects other than vomiting and mild
elevation of liver enzymes. Oral administration of spinosad (300 mg/kg) to
Collie dogs with the MDR gene mutation (p-glycoprotein deficient) did not

Spironolactone
speer-one-oh-lak'tone
Trade and Other Names: Aldactone
Functional Classification: Diuretic
710Spironolactone
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Potassium-sparing diuretic. Action of spironolactone is to interfere with sodium
reabsorption in distal renal tubule by competitively inhibiting the action of
aldosterone. It binds directly to the aldosterone receptor, but at usual doses it does
not block the action of other steroid receptors. It is more properly referred to as an
aidosterone antagonist rather than a diuretic. It does not produce a significant diuretic
action. There are minor antiandrogenic effects produced, but in animals these have
 not been clinically relevant. A related drug, eplerenone (Inspra) has been used in
people because it produces fewer antiandrogenic effects compared to aldosterone.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Spironolactone is used for treating high blood pressure and congestion caused by
heart failure. It is approved in Europe (Prilactone) for dogs, to be used with
standard therapy for the treatment of congestive heart failure caused by valvular
disease. Spironolactone may be used with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
inhibitors to achieve a synergistic effect for treatment of heart failure in animals. The
proposed benefit is via aldosterone antagonism and can be used to inhibit the
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activation that occurs from diuretic
administration (e.g., furosemide) or with some diseases that produce congestion.
Spironolactone has also been used for managing hepatic cirrhosis because it will
inhibit ascites formation caused by excess aldosterone. It has not been beneficial for
treatment in cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (see also Adverse Reactions and
Side Effects section for cats).
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
long-term use may produce some steroid-like side effects. There are concerns
about adverse effects that have been reported from spironolactone use in cats.
Facial dermatitis has been reported from administration to cats. The mechanism
of these reactions is not known. In humans, treatment with spironolactone has
been associated with antiandrogenic effects such as gynecomastia, hirsuitism, and
impotence. Antiandrogenic effects have not been reported from its use in
'sop ale sos un pasqo usaq sy Aydoe sueisoid ieun idxa 'siee
Contraindications and Precautions
 Do not use in patients that are dehydrated. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) may interfere with action. Avoid concurrent use of supplements that
are high in potassium. Do not administer to patients with gastric ulcers or who
may be prone to GI disease such as gastritis or diarrhea.
Drug Interactions
Spironolactone is often used together with ACE inhibitors, such as enalapril. It
acts synergistically with those drugs. Risk of hyperkalemia may increase when
used with an ACE inhibitor, but this has not been a clinical problem in dogs.
Use cautiously with other drugs that can increase potassium concentrations such
as trimethoprim and NSAlDs.
Instructions for Use
Spironolactone usually is administered with other drugs (e.g., ACE inhibitors,
inotropic agents, vasodilators) for treating congestive heart failure.
Stanozolol  711
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor serum potassium concentration when administering with an ACE inhibitor
(e.g., enalapril maleate). Administration of spironolactone may cause a slightly
false-positive result for digoxin assay.
Formulations
Spironolactone is available in 25-, 50-, and 100-mg tablets. Tablets can be split
casily.
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature.
Spironolactone is insoluble in water, but it is slightly more soluble in ethanol. It has
been mixed with syrups for an oral suspension (after first mixing with ethanol) and
found to be stable for 90-160 days.
Small Animal Dosage
Dogs
·2-4 mg/kg/day (or 1-2 mg/kg q12h) PO. In dogs, start with 2 mg/kg/day and
increase gradually, not to exceed 4 mg/kg/day. In Europe, the approved dose for
dogs is 2 mg/kg per day.
Cats
· Use in cats is controverisal because it may produce dermatitis and because the
efficacy is questionable. However, doses in the range of 2-4 mg/kg/day (or
1-2 mg/kg ql2h) PO have been administered for some conditions.
Large Animal Dosage
No dose has been reported for large animals.

Stanozolol
stan-oh'zoe-lole
Trade and Other Names: Winstrol-V
Functional Classification: Hormone, anabolic agent
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Anabolic steroid. Stanozolol is a derivative of testosterone. Anabolic agents are
designed to maximize anabolic effects while minimizing androgenic action. Other
anabolic agents include boldenone, nandrolone, oxymetholone, and
methyltestosterone.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Anabolic agents, such as stanozolol, have been used for reversing catabolic
conditions, increasing weight gain, increasing muscling in animals, and stimulating
erythropoiesis. It has been used in horses during training. Stanozolol has been used
712 Stanozolol
in animals with chronic renal failure and there is some evidence of an improvement
in the nitrogen balance in dogs with renal disease treated with stanozolol. Use in
cats is associated with toxicity.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects from anabolic steroids can be attributed to the pharmacologic
action of these steroids. Increased masculine effects are common. Increased
incidence of some tumors has been reported in people. Some 17-alpha-
methylated oral anabolic steroids (oxymetholone, stanozolol, and oxandrolone)
are associated with hepatic toxicity. Stanozolol administration in cats with renal
disease has been shown to consistently produce increased hepatic enzymes and
hepatic toxicosis.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not administer to cats with renal disease. Use cautiously in dogs that have
other pre-existing disease such as liver failure. Do not administer to pregnant
animals. Stanozolol, like other anabolic steroids, has a high potential for abuse in
humans. This drug is abused by humans to enhance athletic performance.
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions have been reported in animals.
Instructions for Use
However, for many indications, use in animals (and doses) is based on experience in
people or anecdotal expenience in animals.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor liver enzymes for signs of hepatic injury (cholestatic) during treatment.
Formulations
Stanozolol is available in a 50-mg/mL injection as a sterile suspension and 2-mg
tablets. However, there has been limited availability of veterinary injectable
formulations. Commercial forms have been withdrawn from the market, but some

Streptozocin  713
Streptozocin
strep-toe-zoe'sin
Trade and Other Names: Streptozotocin and Zanosar
Functional Classification: Antihyperglycemic agent
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Streptozocin (also known as streptozotocin) is an agent with specific effects on
pancreatic beta cells. It is a nitrosourea alkylating agent with a specific cytotoxic
effect on the pancreatic cells. There is selective uptake into pancreatic beta cells. It
can produce diabetes mellitus in normal animals, but it is used primarily for treating
insuloma tumors in animals. Occasionally it has been used as a cytotoxic agent for
treating other tumors in humans (e.g., lymphoma, sarcomas), but these uses are not
reported for animals. Streptozocin has a rapid half-life in animals but metabolites
may be active. Metabolites rapidly cross the blood-brain barrier.
Indications and Clinical Uses
 In animals, streptozocin is used primarily for treating insulin-secreting tumors
(insulinoma). It has been used in experimental animals to create models of diabetes
mellitus.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Diabetes mellitus is anticipated in treated animals. In humans the major adverse
effect is renal injury caused by tubular necrosis. Renal injury has been reported in
dogs at doses of >700 mg/m?. Other adverse effects include vomiting, nausea,
and diarrhea. Increases in hepatic enzymes and hepatic injury have been reported
 in dogs; however, hepatotoxicity appears to be reversible. Bone marrow

Contraindications and Precautions
Streptozocin may produce diabetes mellitus in treated animals. In addition,
there may be a sudden release of insulin after intravenous administration and
intravenous dextrose should be available to treat acute hypoglycemia. Monitor
5
animals for evidence of renal and hepatic injury. Do not administer to pregnant
animals.
Drug Interactions
No specific drug interactions are reported for animals; however, use with any
other nephrotoxic, hepatotoxic, or myelotoxic drug will exacerbate toxicity.
Instructions for Use
of fluid diuresis. The diuresis should consist of administration of fluids {e.g., 0.9%
saline) IV prior to drug administration. Antiemetics should be administered with
each infusion because vomiting is common. Treatment is continued every 3 weeks
until signs of tumor recurrence occur or until toxicosis limits the continuation of
treatments. Reconstitute vial prior to use by adding 9.5 mL of 5% dextrose or 0.9%
saline to vial. Resulting solution is l00 mg per mL. Further dilute this vial with 5%
dextrose or 0.9% saline for intravenous infusion.

Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Gastric mucosa protectant. Antiulcer agent. Sucralfate dissociates in the stomach to
form sucrose octasulfate and aluminum hydroxide. Sucrose octasulfate polymerizes
to a viscous, sticky substance that creates a protective effect by binding to ulcerated
mucosa. It has an affinity for negatively charged injured tissue. It protects the
adsorbs bile acid. There is some evidence that sucralfate may act as a cytoprotectant
7l6 Sucralfate
(via increasing prostaglandin synthesis), but it is not certain that this is relevant to
the clinical effects in dogs and cats.
Indications and Clinical Uses
 Sucralfate is used to prevent and treat gastric ulcers. However, in clinical use, there
is little evidence that it will prevent ulcers from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs), although experimental evidence is available for horses. Sucralfate is
administered orally and may protect ulcerated tissue and promote healing. Dosage
regimens for sucralfate have been extrapolated from human dosages.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Because sucralfate is not absorbed, it is virtually free of adverse effects. The most
common side effect associated with its use in people has been constipation.
Contraindications and Precautions
No contraindications have been listed for animals.
Drug Interactions
Sucralfate may decrease absorption of other drugs administered orally via
chelation with aluminum (such as fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines). Administer
these other drugs at least 30 minutes before sucralfate. If mixed with other drugs
(antimicrobials), inactivation may occur.
Instructions for Use
Dosing recommendations are based largely on empinicism. There are no clinical
studies to demonstrate efficacy in animals with sucralfate. Sucralfate may be
administered concurrently with histamine Type 2 inhibitors (H2 blockers) (e.g·
cimetidine) without causing an interaction.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
No specific monitoring is necessary.
Formulations
Sucralfate is available in 1-g tablets and a 200-mg/mL oral suspension.
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature.
Sucralfate is insoluble in water, unless exposed to strong acid or alkaline conditions.

Sufentanil Citrate 717
Sufentanil Citrate
soo-fen'tah-nil sih'trate 
Trade and Other Names: Sufenta
Functional Classification: Analgesic, opioid
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Opioid agonist. Action of fentanyl derivatives is via mu-opiate receptor. Sufentanil is
five to seven times more potent than fentanyl, and in some studies it is as much as
10 times more potent than fentanyl. Doses of 13 to 20 mcg of sufentanil produce
analgesia cqual to l0 mg of morphine.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Sufentanil, like other opiate derivatives, is used for sedation, general anesthesia, and
analgesia. It can be used as part of a regimen for balanced general anesthesia. It can
be used with other agents or as a primary agent in patients intubated and delivered
oxygen. Sufentanil has a rapid onset of effect and rapid recovery. It does not
It can also be administered by the cpidural route. The use of sufentanil, compared
to other opiates, has been limited in animals.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects are similar to morphine. Like all opiates, side effects are
predictable and unavoidable. Side effects include sedation, constipation, and
bradycardia. Respiratory depression occurs with high doses.
Contraindications and Precautions
Use cautiously in animals with respiratory disease. Because of its high potency
compared with morphine and other opiates, calculate dose carefilly.
Drug Interactions
Like other opiates, sufentanil may potentiate other sedatives and anesthetics.
Instructions for Use
5
When used for anesthesia, animals are often premedicated with acepromazine or a
benzodiazepine.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor patient's heart rate and respiration. Although bradycardia rarely needs
to be treated when it is caused by an opioid, atropine can be administered if
with naloxone.
Formulations

Sulfasalazine
sul-fah-sal'ah-zeen
Trade and Other Names: Azulfdine and Salazopyrin (in Canada)
Functional Classification: Antibacterial
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Sulfonamide combined with an anti-inflammatory drug. Sulfasalazine has little effect
and salicylic acid (mesalamine) has anti-inflammatory effects. (See manuscript for
mesalamine for more details on mesalamine use.) When administered as the
combination of salicylic acid and the sulfonamide, sulfapyridine, the salicylic acid is
released by colonic bacteria to produce an anti-inflammatory effect. The anti-
inflammatory effect is believed to be through antiprostaglandin action,
antileukotriene activity, or both.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Sulfasalazine is used in small animals for the treatment of idiopathic colitis and other
when dietary therapy has been unsuccessful. Although sulfasalazine has been
commonly used in small animals, use in animals has been pnimarily derived from
empirical use. There are no well-controlled clinical studies or effcacy trials to
document clinical effectiveness. The section on mesalamine has additional
information on clinical use.
728  Sulfasalazine
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects are all attributed to sulfonamide component. Adverse effects are
Ill adai pue ll adi 'suogoeai saiae apnu pue sapiusuons yim paienosse
hypersensitivity, hypothyroidism (with prolonged therapy), keratoconjunctivitis
sicca, and skin reactions. Keratoconjunctivitis sicca has been reported in dogs that
received sulfasalazine for chronic treatment. The amount of salicylate absorbed
appears to be small in cats; therefore adverse effects from salicylate in cats are
unlikely.
Contraindications and Precautions
 Do not administer to animals that are sensitive to sulfonamides. Drug
interactions are possible but have not been reported in animals, probably because
low systemic drug levels are achieved. Mesalamine can potentially interfere with
thiopurine methyltransferase and, therefore, increase the risk of toxicity from
azathioprine.
Drug Interactions
Sulfonamides may interact with other drugs, including warfarin, methenamine,
dapsone, and etodolac. They may potentiate adverse effects caused by
 methotrexate and pyrimethamine. Sulfonamides will increase metabolism of
cyclosporine, resulting in decreased plasma concentrations. Methenamine is
metabolized to formaldehyde, which may form a complex and precipitate with
sulfonamides.
Instructions for Use
Usually used for treatment of idiopathic colitis, often in combination with dietary
therapy. For animals sensitive to sulfonamides, consider other forms of mesalamine
(see mesalamine section for more details).
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor tear production in dogs that receive chronic therapy.
Formulations

Tacrolimus 729
Tacrolimus
tak-roe-lih'mus
Trade and Other Names: Protopic, FK506
Functional Classification: Immunosuppressant
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
tswkwbaensis. Tacrolimus binds to an intracellular receptor and subsequently binds to
calcineurin and inhibits the calcineurin pathway that stimulates the nuclear factor,
NFAT. The action resembles that of cyclosporine (both drugs are calcineurin
inhibitors), although the cellular receptors differ. By inhibiting the action of NFAT,
tacrolimus decreases synthesis of inflammatory cytokines. In particular, synthesis of
IL-2 is inhibited, which results in decreased activation of T lymphocytes. It is
10-l00 times more potent than cyclosporine. Tacrolimus inhibits release of mast cell
and basophil mediators and decreases inflammatory mediator expression.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Tacrolimus is used as an immunosuppressive drug to treat autoimmune disease,
prevent organ transplant rejection, and treat atopic dermatitis. Most use in animals is
with a topical formulation. It has been applied topically (ointment) for localized
areas of atopic dermatitis. In some cases after resolution of lesions with systemic
treatment with cyclosporine, isolated skin lesions are managed topically with
tacrolimus ointment. There has been limited use for preventing renal transplant
rejection in cats because the pharmacokinetics have been highly variable. A related
drug, pimecrolimus, also has been used topically.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
There may be a slight burning or pruritic sensation with initial topical
application. These reactions are mild and decrease as the skin heals. With systemic
administration, dogs may show GI signs, which include diarrhea, intestinal
discomfort, vomiting, intestinal intussusception, and intestinal injury. Tacrolimus

Tegaserod Maleate
teg-ah-ser'-odd mal'-ee-ate
Trade and Other Names: Zelnorm
Functional Classification: Gastrointestinal stimulant
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Tegaserod maleate is an intestinal simulant that produces a prokinetic action to
stimulate motility. It acts by binding to serotonin type-4 (5-HT4) receptors and
tiggers the release of neurotransmitters that stimulate smooth muscle motility.
Activation of 5-HT4 receptors in the GI tract stimulates peristaltic reflex and
intestinal secretion. In horses it has increased motility in the equine pelvic flexure
and accelerated GI transit. In horses it has a 55% oral absorption rate and a half-life
of approximately 2.7 hours.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Tegaserod has been withdrawn from the human market because of adverse effects
 but is still available from some sources. In people it was associated with an increased
risk of cardiovascular adverse events, including heart attack, chest pain, and stroke.
 It had been used in people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) whose primary
symptom is constipation. The only reported use in animals has been in horses to
stimulate intestinal motility. It has increased GI transit in horses and stimulated
motility in the large colon. The use in small animals is primarily anecdotal, and
clinical use is not established.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse cardiovascular events have been responsible for its withdrawal in humans.
However, adverse effects have not been reported in animals.

Tepoxalin
tep-oks'ah-lin
Trade and Other Names: Zubrin
Functional Classification: Anti-inflammatory
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Tepoxalin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Like other drugs in
lipoxygenase (LOX) to decrease synthesis of inflammatory leukotrienes in dogs. This
produces a “dual action” in dogs by inhibiting both prostaglandins and leukotrienes.
734Tepoxalin
Tepoxalin, using in vitro assays, is more cyclo-oxygenase-1l (COX-l) selective
than COX-2 selective. It has not been established if the specificity for COX-l or
COX-2 is related to effcacy or safety. Tepoxalin forms an active metabolite after
administration to dogs, cats, and horses. In dogs, tepoxalin has a half life of 2 hours
and the acid-metabolite has a half-life of l3 hours. It is highly protein bound.
Feeding increases oral absorption in dogs.
Indications and Clinical Uses
and chronic treatment of pain and inflammation in dogs. One of the most common
uses is osteoarthritis, but it also has been used for pain associated with surgery.
 i   n aa  s in r a i a
reducing intra-articular inflammation in dogs and controlling synthesis of intra-
articular PgE2. Because of the dual action of tepoxalin, it has been investigated
for treating other inflammatory conditions in dogs and cats. Studies available thus
inflammatory diseases (for example, ocular inflammation, respiratory disease, or
dermatitis) have had mixed results. Tepoxalin has been more effective than other
drugs for ocular inflammation, but only partially effective for dermatitis, and not
effective for respiratory disease. Use in large animals has not been reported.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
GI problems are the most often adverse effects associated with tepoxalin and can
include vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, ulcers, and erosions of the GI tract. Both
trials, vomiting was the most often reported adverse effect. In studies perfomed
these studies was not shown to adversely affect bleeding times or renal fuinction
Nevertheless, renal toxicity, especially in dehydrated animals or animals with
preexisting renal disease, has been shown for some NSAIDs. Toxicity studies have
not been performed in cats, but single doses of l0 mg/kg to a small group of
cats did not produce adverse effects.
Contraindications and Precautions
Dogs and cats with preexisting GI problems or renal problems may be at a
greater risk of adverse effects from NSAIDs. Safety in pregnancy is not known,
but adverse effects have not been reported.
Drug Interactions
 Do not administer with other NSAIDs or with corticosteroids. Corticosteroids
have been shown to exacerbate the GI adverse effects. Some NSAIDs may
interfere with the action of diuretic drugs and angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE) inhibitors. However, in experimental studies in dogs, tepoxalin combined
with an ACE inhibitor did not produce adverse renal effects.
Instructions for Use
Rapidly dissolving tablets can be administered with or without food. In some
animals, it is helpful to wet the tablet before placing on the animal's tongue.
Long-term studies have not been completed in cats; only single-dose studies have
been reported in which a dose of l0 mg/kg did not produce adverse effects.

Terbutaline Sulfate
ter-byoo'tah-leen sul'fate
Trade and Other Names: Brethine and Bricanyl
Functional Classification: Bronchodilator, beta agonist
Terbutaline Sulfate737
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Betaz-adrenergic agonist. Bronchodilator. Stimulates betaz receptors to relax
bronchial smooth muscle. Terbutaline is more betaz specific than drugs such as
isoproterenol. Other beta2-specific dnugs include albuterol and metaproterenol.
In addition to the beta2 effects to relax bronchial smooth muscle and relieve
bronchospasm, the betaz-agonists also may inhibit release of inflammatory mediators,
especially from mast cells.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Terbutaline, like other betaz-agonists, is indicated in animals with reversible
bronchoconstriction, such as cats with bronchial asthma. It also has been used
in dogs to relieve bronchoconstniction and in animals with bronchitis and other
airway diseases. Use in animals has been primarily derived from empirical use and
experience in humans. There are no well-controlled clinical studies or effcacy trials
to document clinical effectiveness. Albuterol injection may be used as an alternative
for terbutaline injection (4 mcg/kg bolus, up to 8 mcg/kg as needed). Terbutaline
is not absorbed by the oral route in horses; therefore, it is not effective in horses for
oral administration. Clenbuterol usually is the drug of choice for horses.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Excessive beta-adrenergic stimulation from terbutaline at high doses results in
tachycardia and muscle tremors. Arrhythmias are possible with high doses. All
betaz-agonists will inhibit uterine contractions at the end of gestation in pregnant
animals. High doses of beta2-agonists can lead to hypokalemia because they
stimulate Na*-K'-ATPase and increase intracellular K', while decreasing serum K+
and producing hyperglycemia. Treatment consists of KCl supplement at a rate of
0.5 mEq/kg/hr.
Contraindications and Precautions
Administer cautiously to animals with cardiac disease, particularly animals that
may be susceptible to tachyarrhythmias. Do not use late in gestation unless the
intended effect is to delay uterine contractions.
Drug Interactions
Use cautiously with other drugs that may stimulate the heart and cause tachycardia
Instructions for Use
May be administered PO, IM, or SQ. Terbutaline (and other beta2-agonists) have
also been used in people to delay labor (dose in people is 2.5 mg q6h PO). Other
betaz-agonists used in animals for relief of bronchoconstriction include albuterol
and salmeterol. Animals with acute bronchoconstriction also may benefit from
corticosteroid treatment and oxygen therapy. Caution should be used when
administering repeated subcutaneous doses. The maximum subcutaneous dose in
people is 500 mcg/person (0.5 mg) within a 4- hour period.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor heart rate in animals during treatment. Monitor potassium concentration if
high doses are administered.
Formulations
Terbutaline is available in 2.5- and 5-mg tablets and l-mg/mL (equivalent to
0.82 mg/mL) injections.

against some bacteria is bacteriostatic. Tetracycline, like other tetracyclines, has a
broad spectrum of activity including bacteria, some protozoa, Rickettsine, and
Ehrlichiae. Resistance is common. Tigecycline is a new tetracycline that has
improved activity against bacteria that are resistant to other drugs. However, there
are no reports of the use of tigecycline in animals.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Tetracyclines are used to treat a variety ofinfections, including soft tissue infections,
pneumonia, and UTIs. Other drugs in this group that are used more frequently in
animals for treatment include oxytetracycline, minocycline, and doxycycline. Consult
sections containing those drugs for a more complete list of clinical use and indications.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Tetracyclines in general may cause renal tubular necrosis at high doses.
Tetracyclines can affect bone and teeth formation in young animals. Tetracyclines
have been implicated in drug fever in cats. Hepatotoxicity may occur at high
doses in susceptible individuals.
Contraindications and Precautions
 Do not use in young animals because it can affect bone and teeth formation.
Drug Interactions
Tetracyclines bind to compounds that contain calcium, which decreases oral
absorption. Do not mix with solutions that contain iron, calcium, aluminum, or
magnesium.
Instructions for Use
Pharmacokinetic and experimental studies have been conducted in small animals but
not in clinical studies. Use of tetracyclines in small animals has primarily been
replaced by doxycycline. The most common oral tetracycline in horses is doxycycline
or minocycline.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Susceptibility testing: CLSI break point for sensitive organisms ≤2 mcg/mL for
streptococci and ≤4 mcg/mL for other organisms. However, on the basis of plasma
concentrations achieved, l mcg/mL or less should be used for animals. Tetracycline
is used as a marker to test susceptibility for other drugs in this class such as
doxycycline, minocycline, and oxytetracycline. When using tetracycline to test
for susceptibility to oxytetracycline in pathogens from cattle, use a break point
of ≤2 mcg/mL for susceptible bacteria. When using tetracycline to test for
susceptibility to oxytetracycline in pathogens from swine, use a break point of
≤0.5 mcg/mL for susceptible bacteria.

agent.
Thiopental Sodium
thye-oh-pen'tahl soe'dee-um
Trade and Other Names: Pentothal
Functional Classification: Anesthetic, barbiturate
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Ultrashort-acting barbiturate. Anesthesia is produced by CNS depression without
analgesia. Anesthesia is teminated by redistribution in the body.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Thiopental is used primarily for induction of anesthesia or for short duration of
anesthesia (l0-15-minute procedures). It induces a rapid, smooth, and generally
excitement-free induction. It can be administered intravenously, with prior
premedication of other anesthetic adjuncts such as tranquilizers and sedatives (e.g.,
alpha-2 agonists, phenothiazines, and opiates).
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
The most common effect is transient apnea and respiratory depression. Other
adverse effects are related to the anesthetic effects of the drug. Thiopental may
cause cardiovascular depression with a slight decrease in stroke volume and little
change in cardiac output or blood pressure. Premedication will reduce the risk
of cardiovascular events. Supplementation with oxygen during induction also
will decrease cardiovascular events. Overdoses are caused by rapid or repeated
injections. Avoid extravasation outside of the vein.
Contraindications and Precautions
Use carefully in patients with respiratory or cardiac disease. Do not use unless
there is an ability to monitor and maintain respiration.
T
Drug Interactions
Thiopental is compatible with other anesthetics. However, use of other sedatives
and anesthetics will lower dose of thiopental. Thiopental has been combined with

Ticarcillin Disodium
tye-kar-sill'in dye-soe-dee-um
Trade and Other Names: Ticar and Ticillin
Functional Classification: Antibacterial
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Beta-lactam antibiotic. Like other beta lactams, ticarcillin binds penicillin-binding
proteins (PBP) that weaken or interfere with cell wall formation. After binding to
PBP, the cell wall weakens or undergoes lysis. Like other beta lactams, this drug acts
in a time-dependent manner, which indicates that it is more effective when drug
concentrations are maintained above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)
754 Ticarcillin Disodium
values during the dose interval. Ticarcillin has action similar to ampicillin/amoxicillin
and a spectrum similar to carbenicillin. Ticarcillin is primarily used for gram-negative
 infections, especially those caused by Pseudomonas species.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Ticarcillin has been used in animals for treatment of various infections, including
 pneumonia, soft tissue infections, and bone infections. Ticarcillin has similar activity
as ampicillin, but it is extended to include many organisms that otherwise are
resistant to ampicillin, such as Psewdomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative
bacilli. Its activity is enhanced when administered with an aminoglycoside. Use in
animals has been primarily derived from empirical use and derived from
pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic information. It is administered IV in most
animals; intramuscular administration can be painful. Ticarcillin also has been infused
in the uterus of horses to treat metritis.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effcts are uncommon. However, allergic reactions are possible. High
doses can produce seizures and decreased platelet function.
Contraindications and Precautions
Administer cautiously, if at all, to animals with penicillin allergies
Drug Interactions
 Do not combine in same syringe or in vial with aminoglycosides.
Instructions for Use
Ticarcillin may be combined with clavulanic acid (see ticarcillin-clavulanate section
for more details). Ticarcillin is synergistic with, and often combined with,
aminoglycosides (e.g., amikacin and gentamicin). Lidocaine (1%) may be used for

Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Anesthetic. It is a combination of tiletamine (dissociative anesthetic agent similar in
action to ketamine) and zolazepam (benzodiazepine similar in action as diazepam).
Tiletamine + zolazepam produces a short duration (30 minutes) of anesthesia. In
cats, the effect of the zolazepam will have a longer duration than tiletamine. In
dogs, the tiletamine will have a longer duration than the zolazepam. Therefore,
Indications and Clinical Uses
Tiletamine + zolazepam is used for short-term anesthesia in animals. For longer
procedures, other drugs should be used.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Tiletamine + zolazepam has a wide margin of safety, which is greater in cats than
dogs. Side effects include excessive salivation (may be antagonized with atropine),
erratic recovery, and muscle twitching. Drying of the comea may occur unless
ophthalmic ointment is applied to the eyes. Adverse reactions have been observed
when administered to ferrets.
Contraindications and Precautions

Schedule II controlled drug
Tilmicosin Phosphate
til-mye'koe-sin foss'fate
Trade and Other Names: Micotil and Pulmotil tilmicosin premix
Functional Classification: Antibactenial
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Macrolide antibiotic. It inhibits bacteria by binding to 50S ribosome and inhibiting
protein synthesis. The spectrum of activity is limited primarily to gram-positive
aerobic bacteria; Mycopiasma, and respiratory pathogens such as Pastewrella
mnltocida,Mannheimia haemolytica,and Histophilns somni(formerlyHaemophilns
somnus). Tilmicosin administered to calves (15 mg/kg SQ) reduced expression
of prostaglandin (PGE2) stimulated by bacteria. There also may be some anti-
inflammatory effects such as reduced leukocyte release of inflammatory mediators
in the lungs associated with tilmicosin treatment. There also may be reduced
prostaglandin synthesis with tilmicosin administration in alveolar macrophages.
Indications and Clinical Uses
respiratory disease (BRD). In cattle, one injection has duration of at least
72 hours, based on high concentrations achieved in lung. Tilmicosin also has been
used as a prophylactic treatment for calves that are entering feedlots. The use of
tilmicosin at the time of feedlot amival has reduced incidence of respiratory disease
in cattle. Tilmicosin (Pulmotil) is used in medicated feed for swine for control of
swine respiratory disease (SRD).
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Tilmicosin may be cardiotoxic in some animals. Injections to pigs have been
fatal because of cardiotoxicity. The cardiac effects are increased heart rate and
decreased contractility. However, administration of tilmicosin premix in feed of
pigs has been safe. In dogs, tilmicosin injections have caused cardiac toxicosis and
may be caused by calcium-channel blockade; it was reversed by administration of
calcium. In goats, injections >l0 mg/kg IM or SQ can cause toxicity. In horses,
injections of tilmicosin IM or SQ >l0 mg/kg can lead to toxicity. Do not
administer IV to any species. Treatment of accidental injection in people must be
prompt to avoid fatal reactions. Treatment consists of beta-adrenergic agonists
(e.g., dobutamine) and supportive care.
Contraindications and Precautions
Tilmicosin reaches high concentrations in milk for up to 42 days. Do not
administer to lactating dairy cattle. Do not administer to goats. Do not

Bisphosphonate drug. Drugs in this class also include pamidronate, etidronate, and
 pyrophosphate. These drugs are characterized by a germinal bisphosphonate bond.
Their clinical use resides in their ability to inhibit bone resorption. These drugs
decrease bone tumover by inhibiting osteoclast activity, inducing osteoclast
apoptosis, retarding bone resorption, and decreasing the rate of osteoporosis.
Inhibition of bone resorption is via inhibition of the mevalonate pathway.
Bisphosphonates are classified as nitrogen-containing and non-nitrogenous based on
the structure, with the nitrogen-containing drugs being more potent. Tiludronate is
a non-nitrogenase compound. Tiludronate also may have some anti-inflammatory
 properties. Tiludronate has a plasma half-life in horses of 3-7 hours, but bone levels
may be retained for months.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Tiludronate is licensed in countries in Europe but not in the United States. Other
bisphosphonate drugs are used in people to treat osteoporosis and treatment of
caused by navicular disease. It also is used to treat distal tarsal osteoarthnitis {bone
spavin). Like other drugs in this class, it is helpful for managing complications
associated with pathologic bone resorption. It also may provide pain relief in
patients with pathologic bone disease.
Efficacy studies conducted in horses have shown that at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg for
10 days (l.0 mg total dose), it was effective for treatment of navicular disease and
distal tarsal osteoarthritis. Beneficial effects for treating chronic lameness are less
certain.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Reaction to tiludronate has only been reported for horses. After intravenous
infusion, an increase in heart rate and transient hypocalcemia have been observed.
Neither effect is considered significant. In people, there is some concern that it
may result in excessive mineralization and hardening of the bone, which may
result in a greater risk of fractures. However, this effect has not been reported
for animals. No adverse effects on bone mineral density have been reported. In
people, gastrointestinal problems are a concern with bisphosphonates; therefore,
colic is a concern with treatment in horses but has not been reported as a
significant problem.
Contraindications and Precautions
No contraindications have been identifed in animals.
Drug Interactions
Do not mix with solutions containing calcium (e.g., lactated Ringer's
solution).

Tinidazole
tih-nih'dah-zole
Trade and Other Names: Tindamax
Functional Classification: Antiprotozoal
T
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antiprotozoal with action similar to metronidazole. It is a second-generation
nitroimidazole in which the activity involves generation of free nitroradicals via
metabolism that occurs within protozoa. It has action against Trichomonas, Giardin,
and intestinal protozoal parasites. It also has in vitro activity against anaerobic
bacteria and Helicobacter. Half-life is approximately 5.5 hours in horses, 8.5 hours in
Sl sasiou pue ^sies 'saop ul uoydiosqe [eio 'saop ul sinou S'f pue ^sie)
approximately 100%.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Tinidazole is indicated to treat diarrhea and other intestinal problems caused by
intestinal protozoa such as Giardia, Trichomonas, and Entamoeba. Tinidazole also
is active against many anaerobic bacteria and may be used as a substitute for
762 Tinidazole
metronidazole in small animals and horses for treatment of a variety of anaerobic
infections.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Tinidazole has similar action as metronidazole. With high doses it can cause
neurological problems, including ataxia, tremors, nystagmus, and seizures. The
CNS signs are related to inhibition of action of GABA and are responsive to
benzodiazepines (diazepam). Like other nitroimidazoles, it has the potential to
produce mutagenic changes in cells, but this has not been demonstrated in vivo.
Like other nitroimidazoles, it has a bitter taste and can cause vomiting and
anorexia. However, the bitter taste is not as bad as that of metronidazole.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not administer to animals that may be prone to seizures. Do not administer
to animals already known to be sensitive to metronidazole. Do not administer to
pregnant animals.
Drug Interactions
Like other nitroimidazoles, it can potentiate the effects of warfarin and
cyclosporine via inhibition of drug metabolism.
Instructions for Use
Give oral dose with food to minimize the unpleasant taste and decrease nausea.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
 No specific monitoring is necessary. Most anaerobic bacteria have minimum
inhibitory concentration (MIC) values below 2 mcg/mL.
Formulations
Tinidazole is available in 250- and 500-mg tablets.
Stability and Storage
Tablets have been crushed and mixed with flavorings to improve palatability. These
suspensions are stable for 7 days.
Small Animal Dosage
Dogs
· 15 mg/kg ql2h PO.
Cats
· 15 mg/kg q24h PO. Duration of therapy will depend on whether one is treating
Giardin (5 days) or other anaerobic infections (longer than 5 days).

to animals intended for food is prohibited
Tobramycin Sulfate763
Tobramycin Sulfate
toe-brah-mye'sin sul'fate
Trade and Other Names: Nebcin
Functional Classification: Antibacterial
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Aminoglycoside antibacterial drug. Like other aminoglycosides, tobramycin is
bactericidal. It binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit in bacteria to inhibit protein
action. It has a similar spectrum to amikacin and gentamicin, although it is more
active than gentamicin against gram-negative bacteria. Generally, if an organism
is sensitive to tobramycin it will also be sensitive to amikacin. Tobramycin
pharmacokinetics in animals indicates that it has similar clearance and distribution as
other aminoglycosides.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Tobramycin, like other aminoglycosides, is used to treat serious systemic infections
caused by gram-negative bacteria. It is often administered simultaneously with
beta-lactam antibiotics to produce a synergistic effect. The infections treated include
pneumonia, soft tissue infections, and sepsis. Like many off-label antibiotics in
animals, the use in animals has been primarily derived from empirical use and from
pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic information. Tobramycin has also been used
topically. Tobramycin has been used in nebulizing solutions for respiratory
infections.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Nephrotoxicity is the most dose-limiting toxicity. Ensure that patients have
adequate fluid and electrolyte balance during therapy. Ototoxicity and
vestibulotoxicity also are possible.
Contraindications and Precautions
When used with anesthetic agents, neuromuscular blockade is possible. Do not 
mix in a vial or syringe with other antibiotics.
Drug Interactions
T
Avoid mixing in vials with other drugs. It is incompatible with other antibiotics
and inactivation occurs rapidly
Instructions for Use

demonstrated in vitro, but it is not known if this translates to a clinical effect
For nebulization treatment of respiratory infections, administer l60 mg of
tobramycin (total dose) twice daily for 28 days. The solution used for nebulization
(in individual packets with no preservatives) is called TOBI, but it is more expensive
than injectable formulations. Tobramycin injectable has been used instead, but it
contains preservatives that could induce bronchospasm. Use diluted tobramycin
with 3 mL of saline and administer albuterol before nebulization to decrease
bronchospasm.
764Tocainide Hydrochloride
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Susceptibility testing: The CLSI minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value
break point for susceptibility is <4 mcg/mL. Monitor BUN, creatinine, and urine
for evidence of renal toxicity. Blood levels can be monitored to detect problems
with systemic clearance. When monitoring trough levels in a patient dosed once
daily, the trough levels should be below the limit of detection. Alternatively measure
half-life from samples taken at 1 hour and 2 to 4 hours post-dosing. Clearance
should be above 1.0 mL/kg/min and half-life should be less than 2 hours.
Formulations
Tobramycin is available in 40-mg/mL injections.
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature.

Toceranib phosphate
toe-cer-a-nib
Trade and Other Names: Palladia
Functional Classification: Anticancer agent
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Anticancer agent. For treatment of Grade II or III cutaneous mast cell tumors in
dogs. Toceranib (Palladia) is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor that kills
properties occur via inhibition of RTK activity (otherwise known as vascular
766Toceranib phosphate
endothelial growth factor [VEGF]). The effect of toceranib is to produce
antiangiogenic and antiproliferative properties that limit growth of the tumor. After
administration toceranib is widely distributed (VD >20 L/kg) and has a half-life of
approximately 16-17 hours. It has good oral absorption (77%) and high protein
binding (91%-93%). Feeding does not affect oral absorption. High concentrations
appear in the bile, liver, and feces and indicate that it is primarily eliminated by
metabolism and there is little drug excreted in the urine (renal clearance is
approximately 7%). A similar drug that has been used for the same indication in
dogs in Europe is masitinib (Masivet) at a dose of l2.5 mg/kg once daily orally.
Indications and Clinical Uses
 Toceranib is an approved anticancer agent for dogs. The use has been established in
clinical studies for Grade II or III cutaneous mast cell tumors. Many dogs are also
treated with corticosteroids (prednisolone). Although it is approved for mast cell
tumors in dogs, some clinicians have used it to treat adenocarcinoma, melanoma,
and carcinoma; however, efficacy for these indications has not yet been established.
There are no reports available to document efficacy or safety in cats.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Dogs with mast cell tumors often have gastrointestinal problems associated with
antihistamines and drugs to suppress stomach acid (e.g., H2 blockers or proton
pump inhibitors). The most common adverse effects are diarrhea, loss of apetite,
lameness, weight loss, and blood in the feces. It should not be administered
during pregnancy.
Contraindications and Precautions
Daily dosing should not be administered because of frequency of adverse events.
People handling the drug, especially pregnant women, should receive proper
instructions about the drug's adverse effects.

Tramadol Hydrochloride
tram'ah-dole
Trade and Other Names: Ultram, and generic brands. Outside the US,
Tramadon and Altadol
Functional Classification: Analgesic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Analgesic. Tramadol is a racemic mixture (R & S) that has a complicated mechanism
of action. It has some mu-opioid receptor action, but this effect is l0 times lower
than codeine and 6000 times lower than morphine. Tramadol also inhibits the
reuptake of norepinephnine (NE) and serotonin (5 HT) and produces secondary
effects on alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in pain pathways. One isomer has greater
effect on 5 HT reuptake and greater affinity for mu-opiate receptors. The other
isomer is more potent for NE reuptake and less active for inhibiting 5 HT reuptake.
Taken together, the effects of tramadol may be explained through inhibition of 5
HT reuptake, action on alphaz receptors, and mild activity on opiate mu-receptors.
Tramadol has as many as ll metabolites. One metabolite (o-desmethyl tramadol,
also called Ml) may have greater opiate effects than the parent drug (for example,
 do urn ia s in ( u na da ia s oe-
animals that produce this metabolite in sufficient amounts, some analgesic action
may be attributed to opiate-mediated effects from the active metabolite. The
other metabolites have not been shown to have active analgesic activity. The
pharmacokinetics of tramadol and metabolites have been studied extensively in dogs,
horses, and cats. The pharmacokinetics are inconsistent with variation in clearance,
oral absorption, and metabolism to the active metaboite varying among studies
within and between species. Some studies have shown that the active metabolite
(Ml) in dogs is a minor metabolite (l0%-l6% of tramadol concentrations), but
 in other studies the levels of this metabolie were either too low to quantify or
Tramadol Hydrochloride 769
nonexistent and may not contribute significantly to the analgesic effects. Tramadol
half-life in dogs is approximately 1.0-2.7 hours with variable oral absorption, but
oral absorption may be as high as 65%. In cats the half-life is 3-4 hours and they
produce higher and more sustained concentrations of the active metabolite (Ml)
than other animals—presumably because of differences in enzyme activity. Active
metabolite concentration in cats parallels the concentrations of tramadol. Horses
produce only low or undetectable levels of the active metabolite. In horses the oral
absorption has been extremely variable, ranging from 3% to 64%, but in most studies
it has been low. In most studies the half-life in horses is approximately 1.5-2.5
hours. A drug with similar structure and activity as tramadol is tapentadol

its use has not been reported in animals.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Tramadol has been used as an analgesic in people, dogs, cats, horses, and minor
species (e.g., rabbits, goats). It is an alternative to pure opiate analgesics and
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in patients that require treatment

its effectiveness as an analgesic. However, studies have varied in the dose, route,
and pain stimulus evaluated. There has been some evidence of analgesia after
administration for treating pain associated with elective surgery, but there is a lack
of evidence when experimental models of pain have been used. Some studies that
have demonstrated efficacy have used injectable formulations (at 2-4 mg/kg), rather
than oral forms. It may be more effective when used with an NSAID, or other
analgesics such as ketamine or alpha-2 agonists. Tramadol has also been
administered by the epidural route (diluted in saline) in horses, dogs, and cats
(1-2 mg/kg). Although some analgesic was documented in these studies, the effects
it is assumed that tramadol is rapidly distributed systemically after cpidural
administration.

Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
In cats, some vomiting, behavior changes, excitement, and mydriasis may be
observed, which is dose related. Both euphoria and dysphoria have been observed

 If adverse effects occur, they are only partially antagonized by naloxone.
Contraindications and Precautions
Use cautiously with other drugs that have CNS-depressing effects, such as
opiates, alpha2-agonists, or serotonin uptake inhibitors (e.g., antidepressants and
770Tramadol Hydrochloride
may be eliminated via the urine. Use with caution in animals with renal disease
or seizure disorders.
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions have been reported in animals. However, because of
multiple effects from tramadol (serotonin reuptake inhibition, adrenergic effects,
and opiate effects), interactions are possible with other drugs that act via similar
mechanisms. Serotonin syndrome is theoretically possible when used with other
serotonin reuptake inhibitors, but such interactions have not been reported in
animals. It has been used safely with NSAIDs. It has been administered with
inhalant anesthetics without any signs of adverse drug interaction.
Instructions for Use
Dosing information is based on experimental studies in dogs, cats, and horses and
some clinical studies. In most animals the oral immediate-release tablets are
administered, either whole or crushed and mixed with a vehicle. In some countries
an injectable formulation is available that has been injected IV, IM, SQ, and
qpidurally. Tramadol extended-release (ER) tablets have been used in people, but in
dogs these tablets show delayed absorption and plasma levels five times less than
people at equivalent (mg/kg) doses. Therefore, ER tablets for people may be
inequitable in dogs and cats.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
No specific monitoring is necessary. Tramadol is not routinely measured, but
u  o si a u q c ai uq a sn a
for tramadol and 20-40 ng/mL for the active metabolite(Ml).
Formulations
Tramadol immediate-release tablets are available in 50-mg tablets. Tramadol
extended-release (ER) is available in 100-, 200-, or 300-mg tablets. In the US,
 injectable formulations are not available. However, in Europe and other countries,
an injectable formulation is available as a 50-mg/mL injection that can be diluted
further in 0.9% saline solution for intravenous administration. Compounded
formulations of tramadol have been prepared in sterile water at a concentration
of l0 mg/mL. This solution is stable up to l year if stored in the refrigerator
protected from light.
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room

Trandolapril
tran-doe'lah-pril 
Trade and Other Names: Mavik
Functional Classification: Vasodilator, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
inhibitor
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Like other ACE inhibitors, it inhibits conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II.
Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor and will stimulate sympathetic stimulation,
sodium and water retention contributes to congestion. Trandolapril, like other ACE
inhibitors, will cause vasodilation and decrease aldosterone-induced congestion,
but ACE inhibitors also contribute to vasodilation by increasing concentrations of
some vasodilating kinins and prostaglandins. Trandolapril is converted to active
trandolaprilat after administration.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Trandolapril, like other ACE inhibitors, is used for treatment of hypertension and
for management of CHF. Compared to other ACE inhibitors, such as enalapril, it is
not used commonly in veterinary medicine and the use has been derived from
anecdotal experiences.
Precautionary Information
T
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Trandolapril may cause azotemia in some patients; carefully monitor patients
receiving high doses of diuretics.
Contraindications and Precautions
Use cautiously with other hypotensive drugs and diuretics. Nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may decrease vasodilating effects. Discontinue
ACE inhibitors in pregnant animals; they cross the placenta and have caused fetal
malformations and death of the fetus.
Drug Interactions

Trade and Other Names: Desyrel and generic
 Functional Classification: Antianxiety agent, behavioral modification
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Trazodone is an antianxiety agent. It is a triazolopyridine derivative amd belongs to
H7 uuoiaas e se yoq se i 'sanp suuoe Aenua go dnong uziadiuayd a
(5-HT2a) receptor antagonist and a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), with little
effect on dopamine. It also has nonspecific sedating properties and is used as a
sedative and hypnotic. It has an active metabolite that also may have effects on the
serotonin-l receptor. The action as an antidepressant and antianxiety agent appears to
be distinct from tricyclic antidepressants and SSRIs. It is highly metabolized in people,
but the metabolism and pharmacokinetics are not well understood in animals. The
half-life is 6-9 hours in people, but it has not been established for dogs.
Indications and Clinical Uses

to the veterinarian, thunderstorms, noise phobias, travel in a car, and other
phobias and generalized anxiety events. Although trazodone has been helpful to
relieve anxiety in these situations, it has a delayed onset of activity, and can be
umpredictable. To optimize the effects, it should be administered approximately
Trazodone Hydrochloride773
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Although use has been limited, trazodone has been used in dogs without reports
of serious adverse effects. It may have fewer anticholinergic effects than tricyclic
antidepressants. It has not produced adverse cardiac effects or seizure activity.
Contraindications and Precautions
Because of the effect of trazodone on serotonin metabolism, reuptake, and
receptors, its use with other drugs that affect serotonin should be done with
caution. Serotonin-syndrome effects have not been observed in dogs, but it
should be used cautiously with drugs such as SSRIs (fluoxetine, paroxetine),
micyclic antidepressants (clomipramine), tramadol, and monoamine oxidase
inhibitors (segeline).
Drug Interactions
Trazodone is highly metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Such enzymes
specific drug interactions have not been reported for dogs, there should be
caution when administering to animals receiving other drugs known to affect
cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Instructions for Use
Start with a low dose (approximately 2 mg/kg) and work up gradually to higher
doses, as needed. Compared to other behavior-modifying drugs such as SSRIs
and tricyclic antidepressants, trazodone has a more rapid onset of effect. It may be
administered l hour prior to an anticipated event that elicits anxiety in an animal
such as thunderstorms, loud noises, car ride, or visit to the veterinarian. It may be
administered with benzodiazepine drugs.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
No specific monitoring is necessary.
Formulations
It is available as 50-, 100-, 150-, and 300-mg tablets.
Stability and Storage

trye-am-sin'oh-lone
Trade and Other Names: Vetalog, Triamtabs, Aristocort, and generic brands
Functional Classification: Corticosteroid
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Glucocorticoid anti-inflammatory drug. Anti-inflammatory effects are complex, but
of inflammatory mediators. There is disagreement on the potency of triamcinolone.
Most human references indicate that triamcinolone has potency that is approximately
cqual to methylprednisolone (about fve times cortisol and 1.25 times prednisolone).
1 0 i s od  s si Aa A 
times more potent than prednisolone or approximately equal to dexamethasone.
Tniamcinolone acetonide is often used for local treatment or to produce a sustained
concentration. It is an injectable suspension that is slowly absorbed from
 intramuscular or intralesional injection site.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Triamcinolone, like other corticosteroids, is used to treat inflammatory and immune-
 mediated diseases in animals. It is used for similar purposes as prednisolone. The
long-acting injectable formulation (triamcinolone acetonide) is used for intralesional
therapy of tumors and similar purposes as methylprednisolone acetate. Large animal
uses include treatment of inflammatory conditions and of recurrent airway
obstruction (RAO), fomerly called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),
in horses. Triamcinolone acetonide is also given intra-articularly to horses for
treatment of arthritis.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Side effects from corticosteroids are many and include polyphagia, polydipsia/
polyuria, and hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis suppression. Adverse
effects include GI ulceration, hepatopathy, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, decreased
thyroid homone, decreased protein synthesis, impaired wound healing, and
immunosuppression. When triamcinolone acetonide is used for ocular injections,
there is some concern that granulomas may occur at the injection site. In horses,
adverse effects include increased risk of laminitis in horses, although evidence for
this effect has been controversial.
Contraindications and Precautions
 Use cautiously in patients prone to ulcers or infection or in animals in which
wound healing is necessary. Use cautiously in animals with diabetes or renal
failure or in pregnant animals.
Drug Interactions
Use cautiously, if at all, with nonsteroidal anti-infammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
because it may potentiate the GI toxicity.

trye-floo-oh-pare'ah-zeen hye-droe-kloride
Trade and Other Names: Stelazine
Functional Classification: Antiemetic, phenothiazine
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Phenothiazine. Like other phenothiazines, it is a central-acting dopamine (D2)
antagonist and suppresses dopamine activity in the CNS to produce sedation and
prevent vomiting. Other phenothiazines include acepromazine, chlorpromazine,
perphenazine, prochlorperazine, promazine, propiopromazine, and triflupromazine
Indications and Clinical Uses
Trifluoperazine is used for treatment of anxiety, to produce sedation, and as an
antiemetic. It is a weaker sedative than some of the other phenothiazines. In people
it is used to treat psychotic disorders. Use in animals has been primarily derived
from empirical use and experience in humans.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects have not been reported in animals but are expected to be similar
to other phenothiazines. Phenothiazines can lower the seizure threshold in
susceptible animals, although this is controverisal for acepromazine. They can also
cause sedation as a common side effect and extrapyramidal side effects

RCI Classification: 2
Trilostane
trye'loe-stane
Trade and Other Names: Modrenal and Vetoryl
Functional Classification: Adrenal suppressant
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenate, which will interfere with the steps that lead
to cortisol secretion from the adrenal cortex. This enzyme is also involved with
synthesis of aldosterone, corticosterone, and androstenedione. It also affects 
conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone. Therefore, these hormones also may
be decreased from treatment with trilostane. It is used for pituitary-dependent
hyperadrenocorticism (PDH) in dogs. Compared to mitotane, which destroys
adrenocortical cells, trilostane produces a transient decrease in cortisol.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Trilostane is used to treat hypercortisolemia (hyperadrenocorticism) in dogs
(Cushing's disease). Cortisol concentrations will decrease as early as 7-l0 days
after initiating treatment with trilostane. It is reported to improve polyuria,
polydipsia, and polyphagia in 70%-80% of dogs with PDH. Treatment with mitotane
has been compared with trilostane and it has been shown that each drug, although
acting through different mechanisms, produces similar survival times in dogs with
PDH. Other drugs used to treat canine Cushing's disease include mitotane
(Lysodren), selegiline (Anipryl), and ketoconazole—all drugs acting through
dfferent mechanisms. Treatment of Alopecia-X in dogs (Pomeranians and poodles)
has been effective in most animals (9-l2 mg/kg/day PO). Trilostane also has been
effective in cats, with no reported adverse effects. In horses, it has been used to
treat pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (equine Cushing's disease), and there
is preliminary evidence of some benefit from trilostane at a dose of l mg/kg
per day, PO.
Trilostane  781
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
In some dogs, transient lethargy, anorexia, or vomiting is observed. Trilostane
decreases aldosterone; therefore electrolyte concentrations should be monitored.
Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia are possible and may be observed in some dogs
sensitive to the mineralocorticoid inhibition.
Contraindications and Precautions
Trilostane will decrease synthesis of adrenocortical hormones. Use cautiously in
animals with low potassium concentrations. Do not use with aldosterone
antagonists, such as spironolactone.
Instructions for Use
Adjust dose as needed by monitoring cortisol concentrations. Trilostane is a
short-acting drug with a duration of 8-l0 hours. Most dogs can be controlled with
once-daily treatment, but consider administration twice daily in patients that are not
adequately controlled.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor cortisol concentrations in treated animals starting at approximately 10-14
days after starting treatment, then approximately every 3 months. The baseline
serum cortisol can be used to monitor effectiveness of trilostane therapy. The ideal
target range is 1.27-2.9 mcg/dL (35-80 nmol/L). If further evaluation is needed,
use the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test. Perform testing at
peak trilostane concentrations (4-6 hours after trilostane administration). Cortisol
concentrations of 1.45-5.4 mcg/dL (40-150 nmol/L) have been considered
adequate after ACTH stimulation. If cortisol is too low, consider lowening the dose;
if cortisol is too high, consider increasing the dose. Monitor sodium and potassium
concentrations in treated dogs. If necessary, supplement with potassium because of
aldosterone inhibition.
Formulations
Veterinary formulations approved in the US include capsules of 10, 30, and 60 mg.

Phenothiazine with antihistamine activity. It has actions similar to other
antihistamines, but it also produces sedation similar to other phenothiazines.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Trimeprazine is used alone, or in combination with corticosteroids, for inflammatory
and allergic problems. The most common use is for pruritus in dogs in combination
with prednisolone (Temaril-P). It also has been used for treating motion sickness
auI 'soop ul saissninue ue se suolosupaid yiim uogeunquon ul paadde st pue
combination Temaril-P with prednisolone also is approved to treat pruritus in

Trimethoprim + Sulfadiazine
trye-meth'oh-prim + sul-fah-dye'ah-zeen
Functional Classification: Antibacterial
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Trimethoprim-sulfonamides combine the antibacterial drug action of
timethoprim and a sulfonamide. The activity is attributed to their synergistic effect
in inhibiting folic acid metabolism in bacteria. Sulfonamides are competitive
inhibitors of dihydrofolate synthesis. Trimethoprim inhibits the enzyme
dihydrofolate reductase. When used in combination, it has a broad spectrum of
Trimethoprim + sulfadiazine is only available as a veterinary preparation;
 timethoprim + sulfamethoxazole is a human preparation. There are no published
reports of differences in efficacy between trimethoprim + sulfadiazine versus
timethoprim + sulfamethoxazole. The primary difference between sulfamethoxazole
and sulfadiazine is that sulfamethoxazole is metabolized more extensively and
sulfadiazine may attain higher active urine concentrations in some patients. The
pharmacokinetics varies among species and routes of administration. In most animals
the trimethoprim is eliminated faster than the sulfonamide component. The
combination is administered as a l:5 ratio (tnimethopnim:sulfonamide), but the ratio
after administration varies considerably to l:20 or lower. A ratio of l:20 has been
suggested as optimum for antibacterial effects, but this ratio has not been confirmed
in clinical studies in animals
Trimethoprim + Sulfadiazine 785
Indications and Clinical Uses
horses, and some exotic animals. The combination has efficacy for susceptible
bacterial infections (gram-negative and gram-positive), including respiratory
infections, soft tissue and skin infections, wounds, abscesses, and urogenital
infections. In horses, they have been used for respiratory infections, joint infections,
abdominal infections, prostate infections, soft tissue and soft tissue infections, and
infections of the CNS. The combination also is used occasionally for infections
caused by protozoa (e.g., coccidial and Toxoplasma infections).The combination has
not been successful for treating infections in abscesses or infections caused by
anaerobic bacteria, possibly because of interactions with material in necrotic tissues.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
In horses oral administration of trimethoprim-sulfonamides may be associated
with diarrhea. Other effects observed in horses include idiosyncratic neurological
reactions consisting of behavior changes, gait abnormalities, and hyperesthesia.
These effects improved soon after discontinuing medication. Adverse effects
III hypersensitivity, arthropathy, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatopathy,
keratoconjunctivitis sicca, and skin reactions. Dogs may be more sensitive to
   a   ai    s
sulfonamides to metabolites; therefore more toxic metabolite may accumulate in
sme animals. More descriptions of adverse reactions from sulfonamides are listed
for individual drugs. Tnmethopnim-sulfonamides may decrease thyroid hormone
weeks of treatment, but they are reversible
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not administer in animals with sensitivity to sulfonamides. Doberman pinschers
may be more sensitive than other canine breeds to reactions from sulfonamides.
Use cautiously in this breed. If diarrhea develops in horses, discontinue treatment.
Drug Interactions
Sulfonamides may interact with other drugs, including warfarin, methenamine,
dapsone, and etodolac. They may potentiate adverse effects caused by
methotrexate and pyrimethamine. Sulfonamides will increase metabolism of
cyclosporine resulting in decreased plasma concentrations. Methenamine is
T
metabolized to formaldehyde, which may form a complex and precipitate with
sulfonamides. Sulfonamides administered to horses that are receiving detomidine
may develop cardiac arrhythmias. This precaution is only listed for intravenous
forms of trimethoprim-sulfonamides.
Instructions for Use
 Dose listed is of the combined components; 30 mg/kg = 5 mg/kg trimethoprim
and 25 mg sulfonamide. There is evidence that 30 mg/kg/day is efficacious for
Pyoderma; for other infections, 30 mg/kg twice daily has been recommended. Oral
timethoprim is not absorbed in ruminants.

is only available as a veterinary preparation; trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole is a
human preparation. There are no published reports of differences in efficacy between
timethoprim + sulfadiazine versus trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole. The primary
difference between sulfamethoxazole and sulfadiazine is that sulfamethoxazole
is metabolized more extensively. Sulfadiazine may attain higher active urine

cats, horses, and some exotic animals. Trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole is used for
treatment of UTIs, skin and soft-tissue infections, prostate infections, pneumonia,
and CNS infections. In horses, they have been used for respiratory infections, joint
infections, abdominal infections, soft tissue infections, and infections of the CNS.
The combination has not been successfil for treating infections in abscesses or
infections caused by anaerobic bacteria. The combination also is used occasionally
for infections caused by protozoa (e.g., coccidial and Toxoplasmn infections).
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
In horses oral administration of trimethoprim-sulfonamides may be associated
with diarrhea. Other effects observed in horses include idiosyncratic neurological
reactions consisting of behavior changes, gait abnormalities, and hyperesthesia.
These effects improved soon after discontinuing medication. Adverse effects
associated with sulfonamides administered to dogs include allergic reactions,
Type II and Type II hypersensitivity, arthropathy, anemia, thrombocytopenia,
hepatopathy, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, and skin reactions. Dogs may be more
sensitive to sulfonamides than other animals because dogs lack the ability to
acetylate sulfonamides to metabolites and higher levels of more toxic metabolites.
More descriptions of adverse reactions from sulfonamides are listed for individual
drugs. Tnmethopnim-sulfonamides may decrease thyroid hormone after
treatment in dogs. Effects on thyroid finction are most apparent after 2 weeks of
treatment, but they are reversible.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not administer in animals with sensitivity to sulfonamides. Doberman
pinschers may be more sensitive than other canine breeds to reactions from
 sulfonamides. Use cautiously in this breed. The injectable preparation contains
benzyl alcohol, which may cause reactions in small patients. The injectable
preparation should be diluted and injected slowly IV.
Drug Interactions
Sulfonamides may interact with other drugs, including warfarin, methenamine,
dapsone, and etodolac. They may potentiate adverse effects caused by
788Trimethoprim +Sulfamethoxazole
methotrexate and pyrimethamine. Sulfonamides will increase metabolism of
cyclosporine, resulting in decreased plasma concentrations. Methenamine is
metabolized to formaldehyde, which may form a complex and precipitate with
sulfonamides. Sulfonamides administered to horses that are receiving detomidine
may develop cardiac arrhythmias. This precaution is only listed for intravenous
forms of trimethoprim-sulfonamides.
Instructions for Use
The dose listed is of the combined components: 30 mg/kg = 5 mg/kg
tmimethoprim and 25 mg sulfonamide. There is evidence that 30 mg/kg/day is
efficacious for pyoderma; for other infections, 30 mg/kg twice daily has been
 recommended. When using the injectable fommulation, each 5-mL vial should be
diluted in 75-125 mL of 5% dextrose. The diluted fomulation should then be
administered by intravenous infusion over 60 minutes.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Culture and sensitivity testing: CLSI break point for sensitive organisms is
≤2/38 mcg/mL. For streptococci, this break point is ≤2/38 mcg/mL.
Values listed are the concentration of trimethoprim-sulfonamide ratio.
In dogs, trimethoprim + sulfadiazine may cause a functional hypothyroidism
thyroid function at 30 mg/kg ql2h and at 15 mg/kg ql2h. Trimethoprim +
sulfadiazine at 15 mg/kg ql2h for 4 weeks did not affect thyroid function in one
study. Effects of trimethoprim-sulfonamides on thyroid function in dogs are
reversible. In horses, trimethoprim + sulfadiazine did not affect assays of thyroid
fuinction.
Formulations

Tripelennamine Citrate and
Tripelennamine Hydrochloride
tri-peh-len'eh-meen sih'trate
Trade and Other Names: Pelamine, Histanin, and PBZ
Functional Classification: Antihistamine
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antihistamine (H, blocker). Similar to other antihistamines, tripelennamine acts by
blocking the histamine Type l receptor (H1) and suppresses inflammatory reactions
caused by histamine. The H, blockers have been used to control pruritus and skin
inflammation in dogs and cats; however, success rates in dogs have not been high.
More commonly used antihistamines include clemastine, chlorpheniramine,
diphenhydramine, cetirizine, and hydroxyzine.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Tripelennamine is used to prevent allergic reactions and for pruritus therapy in dogs
and cats. In large animals tripelennamine hydrochloride is used to treat laminitis,
allergy, insect bites, pulmonary edema, and urticaria in horses. In cattle it is used to
treat urticaria and allergic reactions. Use in animals has been primarily derived from
empirical use and expenience in humans. Success rates for treatment of prunitus are
low. In addition to the antihistamine effect for treating allergies, these drugs block
the effect of histamine in the vomiting center, vestibular center, and other centers
that control vomiting in animals.

Tulathromycin
too-lath-roe-mye'sin
Trade and Other Names: Draxxin and Macrolide
Functional Classification: Antibacternial
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antibacterial related to the macrolide class of drugs. It is considered a
tmiamilide macrolide, which is derived from azalide macrolides, such as
azithromycin. Like other macrolides it inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding
to the ribosomal 50S subunit. It is considered bacteriostatic, but it may have
bactericidal properties in vitro. Because of a positively charged molecule, it may
 penetrate gram-negative bacteria more easily than other macrolide antibiotics.
Tulathromycin has a spectrum of activity that is limited to gram-positive bactenia
and some gram-negative bacteria that cause respiratory diseases in cattle and pigs
(e.g.,Mannheimia haemolytica, Mycopiasmn, and Pastenrella mnltocida).The
half-life is long (e.g., 92-hour plasma half-life and 8-day tissue half-life in cattle),
-  o g ais a  uo  a ad yr
inflammatory effects attributed to macrolide antibiotics may explain the clinical
effects for respiratory infections, such as reduced inflammatory effects and cytokine
expression in leukocytes.

Ursodiol, Ursodeoxycholic Acid  795
Ursodiol, Ursodeoxycholic Acid
er-soe-dye'ole, er-soe-dee-oks-ih-koe-lik ass'id
Trade and Other Names: Actigall, Ursodeoxycholic acid, Urso
Functional Classification: Laxative, choleretic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Hydrophilic bile acid. Anticholelithic and choleretic. Ursodiol is the short name for
ursodeoxycholic acid. This is a naturally occuming, water-soluble bile acid. Ursodiol,
like other bile acids, can act as a choleretic and increase bile flow. In dogs, it may
alter pool of circulating bile acids, displacing the more hydrophobic bile acids or
enhancing their secretion in liver and bile. By modulating the composition of biliary
bile salts in favor of more hydrophilic bile salts, injury to the biliary epithelium,
such as the cytotoxic potential of endogenous bile acids, is less likely than with
hydrophobic bile salts.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Ursodiol is used for treatment of liver diseases. It is used to treat primary biliary
cirrhosis, cholestatic liver disorders, and chronic liver disease. Although experimental
evidence exists for its benefit in dogs, there are no well-controlled clinical trials that
demonstrate efficacy. In people it has been used as a laxative and to prevent or treat
gallstones.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Loose feces and pruritus are the most common problems in people. In animals
ursodiol may cause diarrhea. Adverse effects can be decreased by gradually
increasing the dose over l-2 weeks.
Contraindications and Precautions
 No contraindications are reported for animals.
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions have been identified for animals. In people it interferes with
some cholesterol-lowering drugs.
Instructions for Use
Results of clinical studies in animals have not been reported. Use in animals (and
doses) is based on experience in people or anecdotal experience in animals. The
U
optimum dose in people is 13-15 mg/kg per day PO. Once or twice daily is as
effective as 3-4 times per day. Administer with meals.

Vancomycin
van-koe-mye'sin
Trade and Other Names: Vancocin and Vancoled
Functional Classification: Antibacterial
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antibacterial drug. Vancomycin is bactericidal for most organisms and bacteriostatic
for enterococci. It inhibits the cell wall by binding to the D-alanyl-D-allanine
bactericidal action occurs by activating bacterial cell wall autolysins. Spectrum
includes Streptococcns, Enterococcns, and Stapiylococcns. Strains of Stapiylococcus
treated often are called methicillin-resistant Stapbylococcns(e.g., methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus[MRSA]or Staphylococcns psendintermedius[MRSP]).
Indications and Clinical Uses
Vancomycin is used for resistant strains of Stapiylococcwsor Enterococcusin animals. It
is the most common injectable drug to treat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus species
and drug-resistant Enterocows spp. It is not effective against gram-negative bacteria.
Vancomycin use is not common in animals because it is inconvenient to administer.
However, it can be valuable for treatment of enterococci or staphylococci that are
resistant to other antibiotics. It also has been administered orally to people for diarrhea
caused by Clostridinm spp. Occasionally it has been used in horses for local infiltration,
such as with regional limb perfision. It is not allowed in food animals.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects have not been reported in animals, but the use has been limited
to a small number of animals and a full range of possible adverse effects have not
been recognized. Adverse effects in people include neutropenia, renal injury
(more common with older products that contained impurities), and histamine
vancomycin  799
release. Reactions, especially those associated with histamine release, are more
likely with a rapid injection.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not administer rapidly IV. It will cause pain if injected by other routes {IM,
SQ). Administer by slow infusion to avoid acute adverse reactions.
Drug Interactions
Do not mix with other drugs in infusion solution; there are incompatibilities
identified for many drugs. It is incompatible with alkaline solutions.
Instructions for Use
Vancomycin must be administered via IV infusion, although in rare instances
intraperitoneal administration has been used in people. (Oral administration is
limited to intestinal infections.) Vancomycin systemic use in horses is rare. Local
administration in horses via regional limb perfusion has been used for localized joint
or bone infections.
Doses are derived from pharmacokinetic studies in cach species. In dogs, to
maintain the plasma concentration between a suggested window of 10 to 30 μg/
mL, the dose rate of 15 mg/kg q8h, IV, is recommended. (This dose actually
produces peaks and troughs of approximately 40 and 5 μg/mL, respectively, but it
is the most convenient dose that can be used because of the short half-life in dogs.)
This dose should be infused slowly over 30 to 60 minutes, or at a rate of
approximately 10 mg/min. The total dose to be administered can be diluted in
0.9% saline or 5% dextrose solution but not alkalinizing solutions. Vancomycin is
available in vials of 500 mg to 5 g (Vancocin, other brands, and generic).
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitoring of trough plasma concentrations is recommended to ensure proper dose.
Maintain trough concentration above l0 mcg/mL. CLSI guidelines for susceptibility
testing list a breakpoint of ≤4 mcg/mL for Enterococcws, ≤l mcg/mL for
Streptococcns, and ≤4 mcg/mL for Staphylococcns.
Formulations
Vancomycin is available in 500-mg and 1-, 5-, and 10-g vials for injection.
Stability and Storage
Stability may be compromised if mixed with other drugs in infusion solutions. Store
in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature. It is
soluble in water and ethanol. After reconstitution with sterile water, it may be
further diluted in 5% dextrose or saline. Solutions may have a dark color. After
reconstitution it is stable for l4 days either at room temperature or in the
refrigerator. Some ophthalmic compounded formulations are not stable and have a
T
low pH that can be irritating to the eyes.

Administration has prohibited the extralabel use of glycopeptides in food-producing
 animals because of risk of producing glycopeptide-resistant bacteria.
Vasopressin
vay-zoe-press'in
Trade and Other Names: Arginine Vasopressin (AVP), Antidiuretic homone
(ADH), Pitressin
Functional Classification: Hormone
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Antidiuretic hormone. Vasopressin mimics the effect of antidiuretic hormone
(ADH) on the tubule of the renal tubule. ADH permits reabsorption of water in
the renal tubule. Without ADH, more diluted urine is excreted. (See Desmopressin
manuscript for additional formulations and use.) Vasopressin also has potent
vasopressive activity via activation of the V, vascular receptor. The V, vascular
receptors are in high density on vascular smooth muscle. V2 receptors occur on the
renal-collecting duct, and stimulation increases water reabsorption. Because of the
vasopressive action, it has been used to treat vasodilatory shock. During infusion it
rapidly increases mean arterial pressure. A related drug, terlipressin, is more specific
for the vascular V, receptor.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Vasopressin is used for treatment of polyuria caused by central diabetes insipidus. It
is not effective for polyuria caused by renal disease. Desmopressin is the preferred
Vasopressin is used to treat vasodilatory shock via constant rate infusion (CRI) in
addition to fluid therapy.

802 Vinblastine Sulfate
Drug Interactions
Verapamil, like other calcium-channel-blocking drugs, is subject to interaction
with drugs that interfere with the multidrug resistance (MDR) membrane pump
(p-glycoprotein) and the cytochrome P450 enzymes. (See Appendix for list of
drugs that may cause interference.)
Instructions for Use
Diltiazem is preferred over verapamil in patients with heart failure because of less
myocardial depression. Oral formulation not absorbed suffciently (of the active
stereoisomer) for adequate effects.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor heart rate and rhythm during treatment.
Formulations
Verapamil is available in 40-, 80-, and 120-mg tablets and a 2.5-mg/mL injection.

Vinblastine Sulfate
vin-blast'een sul'fate
Trade and Other Names: Velban
Functional Classification: Anticancer agent
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Anticancer agent. Vinblastine, like vincristine, belongs to the vinca alkaloid group of
anticancer agents. They have been called “spindle poisons" because they have an
affinity for tubulin in cells. Tubulin is the protein that forms the microtubules
responsible for chromosome migration during mitosis. Vinca alkaloids block
Vinblastine Sulfate803
polymerization of the cellular microtubules and therefore arrest mitosis in metaphase
(m-phase specific).
Indications and Clinical Uses
Vinblastine is used in cancer chemotherapy protocols for various tumors. One of the
most common uses is for canine mast cell tumors (MCT). Although its structure is
similar to vincristine, it has been active against other tumor types and there does not
appear to be cross-resistance from vincristine to vinblastine. Vinblastine has been
used for lymphoreticular neoplasia. Do not use vinblastine to increase platelet
numbers as is done occasionally with vincristine. (Vinblastine may actually cause
thrombocytopenia.)
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
The most dose-limiting effect is bone marrow suppression, with the nadir of
neutropenia occurring at l week after administration and recovery occurring at
2 weeks. Gastrointestinal toxicity is the second most important effect, but it is
milder. Vinblastine does not produce neuropathy as vincristine does. It causes
tissue necrosis if injected outside the vein.
Contraindications and Precautions
If perivascular injection occurs, immediate flushing of area with fluids is
recommended.
Drug Interactions
No drug interactions have been reported in animals.
Instructions for Use
Vinblastine may be used with other anticancer drugs or combined with prednisolone
for mast cell tumors. The most common dose has been 2 mg/m' every 7 to 14 days
by slow IV infusion or rapid IV bolus. But to increase the response rate for mast cell
tumors, evidence suggests that dose intensity should be increased to a dose of
3.5 mg/m?, IV, every 2 weeks. This dose produced more toxicity but higher
efficacy.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor CBC during treatment.
Formulations
Vinblastine is available in l-mg/mL injection.
Stability and Storage
Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature.
Small Animal Dosage
Dogs and Cats
· 2 mg/m? IV (slow infusion) once/week. (See Instructions for Use regarding
higher doses.)
Large Animal Dosage

Regulatory Information
Withdrawal times are not established for animals that produce food. This drug
should not be used in animals intended for food because it is an anticancer agent.
804 Vincristine Sulfate
Vincristine Sulfate
vin-kriss'teen sul'fate
Trade and Other Names: Oncovin, Vincasar, and generic brands
Functional Classification: Anticancer agent
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Anticancer agent. Vincristine, like vinblastine, belongs to the vinca alkaloid group of
anticancer agents. They have been called “spindle poisons" because they have an
affnity for tubulin in cells. Tubulin is the protein that foms the microtubules
responsible for chromosome migration during mitosis. Vinca alkaloids block
polymerization of the cellular microtubules and therefore arrest mitosis in metaphase
thrombocytopenia, vincristine increases thrombopoiesis, increases fragmentation of
megakaryocytes, and decreases platelet destruction. It may also decrease destruction
of platelets by macrophages.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Vincristine is used in combination chemotherapy protocols. It is included in several
anticancer chemotherapy protocols, usually with corticosteroids, alkylating agents,
and other drugs. It has been used in veterinary medicine for lymphoreticular tumors,
transmissble venereal tumors (TVT), mammary neoplasia in cats, and other solid
tumors. It is a component of several combination protocols and may also be useful
as a single agent for some tumors.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Vincristine is generally well-tolerated. It is less myelosuppressive than other
anticancer drugs. Peripheral neuropathy has been reported, but it is rare.
Constipation can occur. Vincristine is irritating to tissues; avoid extravasation
outside vein during administration. If accidental injection is made outside the
 vein, prompt action is needed to avoid severe tissue injury.
Contraindications and Precautions
If penivascular injection occurs, immediate flushing of the area with fluids is
recommended to decrease tissue injury. When handling vincristine, pharmacy and
Dogs with ABCB-l mutation (p-glycoprotein deficient) may have increased risk
of toxicity.
Drug Interactions
There are no significant drug interactions.
Instructions for Use
Vincristine is used in cancer chemotherapy protocols for various tumors.
For example, in the COAP protocol (an acronym for cyclophosphamide,
Oncovin, asparaginase, and Prednisolone) the Oncovin component is
vincristine. Vincristine also increases numbers of finctional circulating platelets
and is used for thrombocytopenia. When used to treat immune-mediated
thrombocytopenia, it may be administered with a corticosteroid (e.g., prednisone at
Vitamin A 805
2 mg/kg) to produce a rapid increase in functional platelets. This regimen
(compared to prednisone alone) has shortened the duration of hospitalization for
dogs with immune-mediated thrombocytopenia.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests

 tocopherol (natural source of vitamin E). It is often a component of omega
fatty-acid formulations used in oral dietary supplements.
Vitamin E 807
Indications and Clinical Uses
Vitamin E is used as supplement and as treatment of some immune-mediated
dermatoses and hepatobiliary disorders. Vitamin E has been used as an oral
treatment for discoid lupus in dogs; however, efficacy for many skin diseases has
been questioned.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Vitamin E at high doses can cause coagulopathies. Doses known to cause
coagulopathy are 1000 units/day (15 units/kg/day) in humans. Coagulopathies
are caused by a decrease in vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors.
Contraindications and Precautions
Use carefully in animals with coagulopathies.
Drug Interactions
Vitamin E may interact with anticoagulants. Vitamin E may exacerbate the
anticoagulant effect of warfarin.
Instructions for Use
Vitamin E has been proposed as treatment for a wide range of human illnesses, but
evidence for efficacy in animals is lacking. In animals it is used as adjunctive
antioxidant therapy for a variety of diseases.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor for bleeding in animals treated with high doses.
Formulations
Vitamin E is available in capsules, tablets, and an oral solution (e.g., l000 units/

Vitamin K
Trade and Other Names: AquaMEPHYTON (injection), Mephyton (tablets),
Veta-Kl (capsules), Veda-Kl (oral and injectable), Vitamin K, Phylloquinone,
and Phytomenadione
Functional Classification: Vitamin
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
See also Phytonadione for additional information. Vitamin K is a cofactor used to
synthesize coagulation factors in the liver (factors II, VII, IX, and X). Vitamin K-1
also is known as phytonadione and phylloquinone (Phytomenadione is the British
pelling of Phytonadione). Vitamin K-2 is also known as menaquinone. Vitamin K-3
is known as menadione. Vitamin K-3 is a synthetic analogue and is not equivalent to
Vitamin K-1. Vitamin K-3 is not recommended for clinical use. Vitamin K-l is
absorbed better with meals that contain fat.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Vitamin K-l is a fat-soluble vitamin used to treat coagulopathies caused by
anticoagulant toxicosis (warfanin or other rodenticides). Anticoagulants deplete
vitamin K in the body, which is essential for synthesis of clotting factors. In large
animals, it is used to treat sweet clover poisoning.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
In people a rare hypersensitivity-like reaction has been observed after rapid
intravenous injection. This reaction may be caused by histamine release from a
These signs also have been observed in animals. To avoid anaphylactic reactions,
do not administer IV. Reactions from intramuscular injection, such as hematoma,
may occur in animals with coagulopathies.
Contraindications and Precautions
Accurate diagnosis to rule out other causes of bleeding is suggested. Other forms
of vitamin K may not be as rapidly acting as vitamin K-l; therefore, consider using
a specific preparation. To avoid anaphylactic reactions, do not administer IV.
Drug Interactions
Some drugs, such as cephalosporins, may decrease vitamin K-dependent clotting
factors.
Instructions for Use
identified. Use vitamin K-l for acute therapy because it is more highly bioavailable.
Voriconazole  809
Administer with food to enhance absorption. Phytonadione and Phytomenadione
are synthetic lipid-soluble forms of vitamin K-1. Menadiol is vitamin K-4, which is a
water-soluble derivative converted in the body to vitamin K-3 (menadione).
Injection can be diluted in 5% dextrose or 0.9% saline but not other solutions.
Although Vitamin K-l veterinary labels have listed the intravenous route for
administration, these labels have not been approved by the FDA. Therefore, avoid
intravenous administration of vitamin K-l. The preferred route is subcutaneous, but
intramuscular also can be used. When treating for poisoning by second-generation
rodenticides, which have long half-lives, 6 weeks of therapy may be necessary.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitoring bleeding times in patients is essential for accurate dosing of vitamin K-l
of the bleeding times is suggested.
Formulations
Vitamin K is available in 2- or l0-mg/mL injection. Mephyton is a 5-mg tablet.

cell wall. Voriconazole is similar in structure to fluconazole; however, it is more
active and potent. Voriconazole is active against dermatophytes and systemic fingi,
such as Blastomyces, Histoplasmn, and Coccidioides. It also has activity against yeast,
such as Candida and Malassezia.Voriconazole has greater activity against Aspergillus
and Fusariwm than other drugs of this class and is indicated for systemic treatment.
Voriconazole is more lipophilic than fuconazole and more water soluble than
itraconazole or ketoconazole, with intermediate protein binding. These properties
provide good oral bioavailability and tissue distribution. Pharmacokinetics may be
shown rapid and complete absorption of the drug following oral administration.
 Oral absorption is higher than in most other drugs in this class. In horses,
voriconazole was absorbed 92% and had a half-life of 13 hours.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Voriconazole has been used to treat dermatophytes and systemic fungi, such as
Blastomyces, Histoplasma, and Coccidioides. It has been used to treat infections
caused by Aspergillus and Fusarinm. The efficacy in humans for treating Aspergillns
Penetration into the CNS and eye is high enough to treat infections in these areas.
Most of the use in veterinary medicine has been empirical or extrapolated from the
use in humans. Clinical experience in horses has used a dose of 2 mg/kg once-daily
PO. But research studies have showed that a dose of 4 mg/kg once daily, PO, or a
dose of 3 mg/kg q12h, PO, produces adequate in plasma and tissue concentrations
(ocular tear film, CSF, urine, epithelial lining fluid of the lung, and synovial fluid)
for susceptible fungi, including Aspergillus. It has also been administered topically in
horses for ocular fungal infections (using the IV l% solution every 4 hours).
Voriconazole also has been used in birds to control infections caused by
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Voriconazole has been associated with neurotoxicity in cats at doses of l0 mg/kg
via an unknown mechanism. Some cats administered therapeutic doses exhibited
CNS signs that resolved after discontinuation of the drug. These reactions
have not been reported in other animals (dogs, horses, birds) treated with
voriconazole. Although it is generally better tolerated than ketoconazole in most
species, vomiting and hepatotoxicity are possible, especially at high doses. In
reported.
Contraindications and Precautions
A safe dose has not been identifed for cats. Use cautiously in any animal with
signs of liver disease. Use cautiously in pregnant animals. At high doses in
laboratory animals, drugs in this class have caused fetal abnormalities. Use the
oral formulation rather than the IV form in animals with renal disease.
Drug Interactions
Voriconazole is a cytochrome P450 enzyme inhibitor. It may cause drug
interactions because of inhibition of P450 enzymes. However, this inhibition is
not expected to be as prominent as with ketoconazole.

hours in cats).
Indications and Clinical Uses
In small animals, it has been used to treat hypercoagulation disease and prevent
thromboembolism. In horses, warfarin has been used to treat navicular disease,
'asn sun ioy reindod jou st il qonoue
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Adverse effects are attributable to decreased blood clotting. Spontaneous
bleeding can result in blood loss, hemoperitoneum, hemarthrosis, gastrointestinal
bleeding, epistaxis, and excessive bleeding from trauma or surgery.
Contraindications and Precautions
 Do not administer to animals that may be prone to bleeding. Administer carefilly
with other drugs that are known to interfere with coagulation.
Drug Interactions
Multiple drugs and some foods may affect warfarin's action. Some of these
that may potentiate warfarin's action include aspinin, chloramphenicol,
phenylbutazone, ketoconazole, and cimetidine. Drug interactions are possible
with administration with other highly protein-bound drugs, but such reactions
are poorly documented in animals. Drug interactions are also possible with
timethoprim sulfonamides and metronidazole. Do not administer with some
cephalosporin drugs (particularly those with N-methylthiotetrazole [NMTT])
because cephalosporins may induce bleeding through anti-vitamin-K-dependent
mechanisms.
Instructions for Use
Warfarin response can be highly variable among animals. Pharmacokinetic studies
have attempted to correlate plasma pharmacokinetics with clinical response
(prothrombin time [PT ]). However, such a correlation has been difficult to
demonstrate. A particular dose and plasma concentration that produces an effective
individual. Because of the variation in response, adjust doses by monitoring bleeding
times in treated animals. For a rapid effect, consider a loading dose of 6 mg/kg
once daily for two treatments in dogs. Initial doses in cats have ranged from 0.06 to
0.09 mg/kg (0.25-0.5 mg/cat/day). When dividing tablets for treatment, it is best

warfarin within the tablet. Some fractions of the tablet may contain a higher amount
than others.
Warfarin Sodium  813
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Adjust dose by monitoning clotting time. Optimum dose is highly individualistic.
Prothrombin times are reported in seconds and recorded as a ratio of the
laboratory and as the international normalized ratio (INR). The INR is the most
reliable way to monitor the prothrombin time. In animals the dose is adjusted to
maintain PT at l.5 to 2 times normal (or INR of 2-3).
Formulations
Warfarin sodium is available in 1-, 2-, 2.5-, 4-, 5-, 7.5-, and 10-mg tablets.
Stability and Storage
Warfarin sodium is soluble in water. It is light sensitive and should be packaged in
tight containers. Solutions should have a pH >8 to maintain solubility. Some tablets
do not have the drug distributed evenly; therefore, uneven doses can result from
splitting tablets.

8l4Xylazine Hydrochloride
Xylazine Hydrochloride
zye'lah-zeen hye-droe-klor'ide
Trade and Other Names: Rompun and genenic brands
Functional Classification: Alphaz-adrenergic agonist, analgesic, sedative
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Alphaz-adrenergic agonist. Alpha2-agonists decrease release of neurotransmitters from
the neuron. They decrease transmission via binding to presynaptic alphaz-receptors
(negative feedback receptors). The result is decreased sympathetic outflow, analgesia,
sdation, and anesthesia. Other drugs in this class include medetomidine,
dexmedetomidine, romifidine, detomidine, and clonidine. Xylazine is not as specific
as other drugs in this group. Receptor binding studies indicate that alpha2/alphay
adrenergic receptor selectivity was l620 for medetomidine and l60 for xylazine.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Xylazine is used for short-term sedation, anesthesia, and analgesia in horses, dogs,
cats, cattle, and exotic animals. Like other alpha2-agonists, it is used as an anesthetic
adjunct and analgesic. The duration of effect is approximately 30 minutes.
Compared to xylazine, dexmedetomidine and medetomidine produce better sedation
sedative effects, followed by detomidine, medetomidine, and xylazine.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
 In small animals, vomiting is the most common acute effect, which is more
prominent in cats. Xylazine produces sedation and ataxia. Xylazine, like other
alpha2-agonists, decreases sympathetic output. Cardiovascular depression may
occur. Cardiac effects can include sinoatrial block, frst- and second-degree AV
block, bradycardia, and sinus arrhythmia. In ruminants, use of xylazine may
decrease GI motility and cause bloating, salivation, and regurgitation. Note that
cattle, sheep, and goats are much more sensitive to xylazine than other animals,
which requires lowering the dose. Like other alphaz-agonists, xylazine produces
transient hyperglycemia, which may increase urine flow.
Contraindications and Precautions
Ruminants are much more sensitive to xylazine than other species, and lower
doses must be used compared with other animals. Use cautiously in animals that
are pregnant. Xylazine impairs blood flow to the uterus during gestation in cows
and may decrease oxygen delivery to fetus, especially in late gestation. Use
caution when using xylazine to sedate pregnant cows. It also may induce labor.
Use cautiously, if at all, in patients with cardiac disease. Because of cardiac
depression, it should not ordinarily be used with tranquilizers such as
phenothiazines. Reverse effects of xylazine with an alphaz-antagonist (e.g
yohimbine or atipamezole) if there are dangerous adverse effects.
Drug Interactions
Use with opioid analgesic drugs will greatly enhance the CNS depression.
Consider lowering doses if administered with opioids. Do not administer with
other drugs that cause significant cardiac depression.
Xylazine Hydrochloride815
Instructions for Use
Xylazine is often used in combination with other drugs (e.g., ketamine or
butorphanol). It is not necessary to premedicate animals with atropine. For large
animals, if sedation is needed without recumbency, use the lower end of the
dose range.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor heart rate and rhythm during anesthesia with xylazine. It may cause
increased plasma glucose in animals.

8l8 Zilpaterol Hydrochloride
Regulatory Information
Do not administer to animals intended for food.
Zilpaterol Hydrochloride
Zil-pat'-e-role
Trade and Other Names: Zilmax
Functional Classification: Beta-adrenergic agonist
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Zilpaterol is a synthetic beta (β)-receptor adrenergic agonist. It resembles other
β-agonists in some actions to produce effects similar to norepinephrine. Zilpaterol is
efficiency. Zilpaterol, like other β-adrenergic agonists, stimulate β2-adrenergic
receptors in muscle and promote muscle gain with less fat. Subsequently, if fed to
 cattle at approved levels, zilpaterol increases feed efficiency and improves muscle
weight gain. In clinical studies, it substantially increased skeletal muscle mass and
cross-sectional area of individual muscles.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Zilpaterol is fed to cattle (Type A medicated feed) to improve weight gain and
muscle mass. It has been approved in other countries for several years and recently
has been approved for use in the US.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
Like other β-adrenergic agonists, zilpaterol can produce cardiovascular problems
associated with increased stimulation of receptors at high doses
Contraindications and Precautions
Severe adverse effects such as tachycardia, tremors, and muscle fasciculations have
been observed in horses. Zilpaterol should not be administered to horses, and
precautions should be taken to ensure that horses are not accidentally exposed to
zilpaterol-treated cattle feed.
Because β-adrenergic agonists such as clenbuterol are abused in humans for
the purpose of promoting muscle gain and fat loss, there is a possibility that
zilpaterol also could be abused in the same manner.
Labeling should include the following information: (a) Do not allow horses or
other equines access to feed containing zilpaterol. (b) Not for use in animals
S   s  o ()   
Drug Interactions
Use caution when administering to animals receiving other adrenergic
medications.
Instructions for Use
Zilpaterol is used to increase rate of weight gain, improve feed effciency, and
increase carcass leanness in cattle fed in confinement for slaughter during the last 20
to 40 days on feed. It should be fed continuously as the sole ration during the last
20 to 40 days on feed.

Zinc
Trade and Other Names: Zinc
Functional Classification: Nutritional supplement
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Zinc is an essential element important in more than 200 metalloenzymes. It also is
important for nucleic acid, cell membrane, and protein synthesis. It is also important
for growth, tissue repair, and cell division. Zinc acts as a chelating agent, and it
competes with iron to inhibit fibrosis and collagen formation. The benefits have
been seen in experimental animals and in humans with liver disease. One of the uses
pue juepixogue ue se ie Aeu osle sunz 'sisoun suedaq seueu on uaaq su
prevent membrane damage. Zinc also induces the production of metallothionein in
intestinal mucosal cells, which binds copper from the diet and prevents uptake to
the liver.
Indications and Clinical Uses
It has been used to treat zinc-deficient diseases such as those that cause
dermatologic problems. It is also used as an antifibrotic agent in liver disease. One
of the other uses of zinc is as a chelating agent in animals. Most commonly, zinc has
been used as a cupruretic to decrease copper concentrations in animals with liver
disease, often in combination with other drugs (e.g., penicillamine). When used to
treat copper liver disease, it is slow acting and may take as long as 3 months for the
full effect.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
The most common effect is GI problems, including nausea and vomiting.
Z
Hemolysis and anemia can be observed with high doses.
820Zinc
Contraindications and Precautions
If intravenous forms are used (e.g., zinc sulfate), adverse effects may be more
likely because ordinarily the oral absoption is more limited.
Drug Interactions
Oral absorption is impaired from tetracyclines, iron, copper, phytates (found in
bran and grains), and penicillamine.
Instructions for Use
Administer without food to improve oral absorption, but a small meal will often
 prevent some of the nausea associated with treatment. When considering various
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Monitor blood zinc concentrations at least monthly to prevent high levels, which
cause hemolysis. Blood zinc concentrations should ideally be 200 to 500 mcg/dL
A concentration above 800 mcg/dL is considered toxic, but levels above 200 mcg/
dL are needed to treat copper liver disease.
Formulations
Zinc is available in several forms, including zinc sulfate (23% zinc), zinc gluconate
(14% zinc), and zinc acetate (35% zinc). Zinc gluconate is available in tablets
(z [eiua jo u 1 = aeuon uz u 01) u 7 o I way uu
Zinc sulfate is available in capsules 25- and 50-mg elemental zinc (1l0 mg zinc
sulfate = 25 mg elemental zinc). Zinc sulfate is available in tablets: 15, 25, 45, and
50 mg (elemental zinc, 66 mg zinc sulfate = 15 mg elemental zinc). Injectable zinc
sulfate is 50-mg/mL (20.2 mg elemental zinc per mL) solution for IV use.
Stability and Storage
Small Animal Dosage
Dogs and Cats
Adjust dose based on measuring plasma zinc concentrations.
· Hepatic disease in dogs: 100 mg elemental zinc per dog, ql2h, PO, or 3 mg zinc
gluconate/kg per day, or 2 mg zinc sulfate/kg per day, PO. (Consider including
vitamin E with treatment.)
· Zinc supplement: l mg/kg elemental zinc of gluconate or sulfate three times/day
PO, or l.5 to 3 mg (of elemental zinc) zinc acetate daily per animal PO.
·Dermatologic use: 10 mg/kg daily (zinc sulfate or zinc gluconate).
· Intravenous zinc treatment: 50 mcg elemental zinc/kg infused IV slowly per day.
Large Animal Dosage
 No specific doses have been reported. Extrapolate dose needed from small animal
use (approximately l mg/kg elemental zinc three times per day PO) and adjust dose
ty monitoning zinc concentrations.
Regulatory Information
Because of low risk of harmfil residues in animals intended for food, no withdrawal
time is suggested.
Zoledronate 821
Zoledronate
Zoe'- le-droe-nate
Trade and Other Names: Zometa, Zoledronic acid
Functional Classification: Antihypercalcemic
Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action
Bisphosphonate drug. Zoledronate is zoledronic acid (Zometa). Drugs in this class
include pamidronate, etidronate, tiludronate, and alendronate. These drugs are a
group of drugs characterized by a germinal aminobisphosphonate bond. They slow
the formation and dissolution of hydroxyapatite crystals. Their clinical use resides
in their ability to inhibit bone resorption. These drugs decrease bone tumover
by inhibiting osteoclast activity, inducing osteoclast apoptosis, retarding bone
resorption, and decreasing the rate of osteoporosis. Inhibition of bone resorption is
          s
approximately 2.2 hours, with a volume of distribution of 0.28 L/kg.
Indications and Clinical Uses
Zoledronate, like other bisphosphonate drugs, is used to treat refractory
hypercalcemia, osteoporosis, and treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy. In
animals, bisphosphonates are helpful for managing neoplastic complications and pain
associated with pathologic bone resorption. They also may provide pain relief in
patients with pathologic bone disease. It has been used in similar protocols as for
pamidronate but has the advantage of a 15-minute infusion IV rather than 2-4
hours for pamidronate.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
 s  d  ig ed   s  
been observed in people, but otherwise no serious adverse effects have been
identifed. The use in animals has not been common enough to identify a wider
range of adverse effects. In people, there is some concern that the use of
bisphosphonates produces excessive mineralization and hardening of the bone,
which may result in a greater risk of fractures. However, this effect has not been
reported for animals.
Contraindications and Precautions
Do not administer during pregnancy.
Drug Interactions
Do not mix with calcium or other divalent cation-containing infusion solutions,
such as lactated Ringer's solution. It should be administered as a single
 intravenous solution in a line separate from other drugs.
Instructions for Use
Zoledronate is intended for IV infusion. Dilute vial in 0.9% saline or 5% dextrose
solution for IV use. If not used immediately after dilution, the solution should be
refngerated, and the refngerated solution then should be equilibrated to room
temperature prior to administration. The total time between dilution, storage in the
7
refnigerator, and end of administration must not exceed 24 hours.

hours in one study and l6 hours (plasma) to 57 hours (red blood cells [RBCs]) in
(snoy ee) sop un ue noauol st a-ey ayn 'sien ui Anis 1ayioe
Indications and Clinical Uses
Zonisamide is used to treat refractory seizures in dogs when other drugs have not
been effective. It has been effective in experimentally induced seizures in dogs and
 in approximately 50% of dogs with refractory epilepsy. It has been used as an add-on
with other anticonvulsant drugs such as phenobarbital and potassium bromide.
Precautionary Information
Adverse Reactions and Side Effects
At the suggested clinical doses, adverse effects have not been reported for dogs.
Adverse reactions can include lethargy, ataxia, and vomiting. Like other
Zonisamide823
anticonvulsants, ataxia, sedation, and CNS changes are possible. In safety studies,
beagles received 75 mg/kg/day for l year with minimal side effects. In cats,
adverse effects include mild gastrointestinal problems, sedation, and ataxia.
Contraindications and Precautions
Because zonisamide resembles sulfonamides in structure, use cautiously in animals
that are sensitive to these drugs. (See sulfonamide manuscripts for full details on
sulfonamide adverse effects.)
Drug Interactions
When administered concurrently with phenobarbital, the half-life of elimination is
more rapid for zonisamide, which may necessitate higher doses. It is expected to
potentiate other CNS depressants and anticonvulsants.
Instructions for Use
Most experience with zonisamide in animals has been preliminary work in dogs with
refractory epilepsy. Although low doses may produce plasma concentrations within
the therapeutic range reported for people, when administered with phenobarbital,
drug concentrations may be lower because drug metabolism is increased.
Zonisamide half-life was shorter in dogs receiving phenobarbital concurrently. These
observations indicate that higher doses may be needed for combination therapy with
phenobarbital compared to monotherapy. With chronic treatment some tolerance
that reduces efficacy after 2-3 months may develop.
Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Effective plasma concentrations in animals have been suggested to be
10-40 mcg/mL.
Formulations
Zonisamide is available in 25-, 50-, and 100-mg capsules.
Stability and Storage
Stability of compounded formulations has not been evaluated.

Strength of solution (mg/mL)= (% strength) × 10
Total dose needed
mLneeded
Strength of solution (mg/mL)
Example
20 kg dog needs 15 mg/kg of a 20% solution
20 kg × 15 mg/kg = 300 mg total dose needed
Tu/su 00z = 01 × %0z = uounos jo ysuans
mL needed = 300 mg/200 mg/mL = 1.5 mL
How to Calculate Tablets Needed
Dose (mg/kg)×kilograms body weight = total dose needed (mg)
= Number of tablets needed
Strength of tablet
Example
20 kg dog needs 12 mg/kg
Tablet size is 100 mg
20 kg × 12 mg/kg = 240 mg total dose needed
240 mg/100-mg tablets = 2.4 tablets
(In most instances, you would round up to 2y tablets if the medication has
sufficient safety.)
How to Calculate Infusion Rates
Dose (mg/kg/min) x kilograms body weight = total dose needed (mg) per minute
If dose is listed in micrograms/kg/min, multiply by 1000 for mg/kg/min.
Strength of solution (mg/mL) = (% strength) × 10
Total dose needed per minute
=mL needed per minute
Strength of solution (mg/mL)
mL needed per minute X 60 = mL needed per hour
Administer the total mL to fluid administered in each hour interval. If fluid is
to be administered over 24 hours: mL needed per hour X 24 = mL needed
per day.
Example:
· 20 kg dog needs 0.15 mg/kg/min (150 mcg/kg/min) of a 10% solution
· Fluid rate (lactated Ringer's solution) is 60 mL/kg/day
· 20 kg × 0.15 mg/kg/min = 3.0 mg needed per minute
·Strength of solution = 10% ×10 = 100 mg/mL
Appendix ACalculation of Drug Doses825
°mL needed per min = (3.0 mg per min)/100 mg/mL = 0.03 mL per min
· 0.03 mL per minute X 60 min/hr = 1l.8 mL added to each hour of fluids
·Fluid rate is 60 mL/kg/day = 2.5 mL/kg/hr = 50 mL/hr for a 20-kg dog.
To each 50 mL/hr fluid volume to be infused, add l.8 mL of medication. If drug is
stable in solution for 24 hours, total amount can be added to a 24-hour volume of
fluid:
Total fluid needed per 24 hours = 60 mL/kg/day × 20 kg = 1200 mL
1.8 mL per hour × 24 hr = 43.2 mL per day added to 1200 mL total fluid
requirement.

Compounded Formulations: What to Look for
to Detect Incompatibility or Instability
Liquid-Dose Forms
Color change (pink or amber)
Signs of microbial growth
Cloudiness, haze, flocculent or film formation
Separation of phases (e.g., oil and water, emulsion)
Precipitation, clumping, crystal formation 
Droplets or fog forming on inside of container
Gas or odor release
Swelling of container
Solid-Dose Forms
Odor (sulfur or vinegar odor)
Excessive powder or crumbling
Cracks or chips in tablets
 Swelling of tablets or capsules
"Rules"
Do not mix drugs that require reconstitution in a vial with other drugs, and do
not add other drugs to the vial.
 Do not mix drugs that are not in an aqueous vehicle (e.g., propylene glycol) with
IV fluids.
Do not mix hydrochloride salts (HCl) or drugs with buffers (citrates,
bicarbonates, phosphates).
Beyond-use-date for compounded drugs (the date after which a compounded
 preparation is not to be used) is 14 days for water-containing formulations
(refrigerated); 6 months for nonaqueous liquids and solid formulations; and
60 days for other formulations. These times may be exceeded if there is valid
scientific stability information.

Owner Information
Always Include
· Patient's name (in “quotes")
· Patient's age or date of birth
·Owner's name (or that of an owner representative)
· Owner's address
· Owner's phone number
Common Prescription Writing Errors to Avoid
· Always use metric units: e.g., g (gram) for solids; ml or mL (milliliter) for liquids.
· Use per instead of a slash (/), which can be interpreted as the number l.
· Use units instead of the abbreviation u, which can be interpreted as 0 or 4 or m.
· Use once daily instead of sid, which has been interpreted as 5/d or 5 per day.
(NOTE: “sid" is not a conventional prescription abbreviation.)
· Use three times daily instead of tid, and use four times daily instead of qid.
·Use every other day instead of qod.
· AVOID CONFUSING ABBREVIATIONS—abbreviations like qd, qid, and qod
are easily confused with each other
· When writing numbers:
·Use a leading zero with decimals (e.g., use 0.5 mL rather than .5 mL).
·Avoid using a trailing zero (e.g., use 3 rather than 3.0).
· ALWAYS-When in doubt, spell it out.

Performance Horse Drug Regulations and Restrictions
Association of Racing Commissioners International,
Inc., Uniform Classification Guidelines for Foreign
Substances (Revised January 2010)
The following definitions, regulations, and restrictions are adapted from the Racing
Commissioners International web site: www.arci.com, and FEI Clean Sport
Prohibited Substances List: http://www.feicleansport.org/.
RCI Drug Classification Scheme is based on (1) pharmacology, (2) drug use
patterns, and (3) the appropriateness of a drug for use in the racing horse.
ClassificationDefinitions
Class 1
Stimulant and depressant drugs that have the highest potential to affect performance
and that have no generally accepted medical use in the racing horse. Many of these
agents are Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) schedule II substances. These include
s saaa d sdo i r  s  am
opioids and psychoactive drugs, amphetamines and amphetamine-like drugs, as well
as related drugs, including but not limited to apomorphine, nikethamide, mazindol,
pemoline, and pentylenetetrazol. Though not used as therapeutic agents, all DEA
depressant substances with psychotropic and often habituative actions.
Class 2
  e  s i d e  d  e   s
drugs in Class l. These drugs are l) not generally accepted as therapeutic agents
d  e   s    ( i   
abuse. Drugs in this class include: psychotropic drugs, certain nervous system and
cardiovascular system stimulants, depressants, and neuromuscular blocking agents.
Injectable local anesthetics are included in this class because of their high potential
for abuse as nerve-blocking agents.
Class 3
 Drugs that may or may not have generally accepted medical use in the racing horse,
but the pharmacology of which suggests less potential to affect performance than
other drugs with primary effects on the autonomic nervous system, procaine,
antihistamines with sedative properties and the high-ceiling diuretics.
Class 4
This class includes therapeutic medications that would be expected to have less
potential to affect performance than those in Class 3. Drugs in this class includes
less potent diuretics; corticosteroids; antihistamines and skeletal muscle relaxants
without prominent central nervous system (CNS) effects; expectorants and
mucolytics; hemostatics; cardiac glycosides and anti-arrhythmics; topical
anesthetics; antidiarrheals; and mild analgesics. This class also includes the
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), at concentrations greater than
established limits.
840 Appendix N Performance Horse Drug Regulations and Restrictions
Class 5
This class includes those therapeutic medications for which concentration limits have
been established by the racing jurisdictions, as well as certain miscellaneous agents
such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and other medications as determined by the
regulatory bodies. Included specifically are agents that have very localized actions
 only, such as anti-ulcer drugs, and certain anti-allergic drugs. The anticoagulant
drugs are also included.
Prohibited substances in racing horses
A) The possession and/or use of a drug, substance or medication, specifed below,
on the premises of a facility under the jurisdiction of the regulatory body for
which a recognized analytical method has not been developed to detect and
confirm the administration of such substance; or the use of which may endanger
the health and welfare of the horse or endanger the safety of the rider or driver;
or the use of which may adversely affect the integrity of racing:
1) Erythropoietin
2) Darbepoetin
3) Oxyglobin
4) Hemopure
B) The possession and/or use of a drug, substance, or medication on the premises
of a facility under the jurisdiction of the regulatory body that has not been
 approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the
United States.
C) The practice, administration, or application of a treatment, procedure, therapy,
or method identified below, which is performed on the premises of a facility
under junisdiction of a regulatory body and which may endanger the health and
welfare of the horse or endanger the safety of the rider or driver, or the use of
which may adversely affect the integrity of racing:
