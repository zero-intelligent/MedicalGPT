Description of the patient
 In addition to the age and sex of the patient, the species,breed
and origin are of special importance. Many disorders of the
eye have a predisposition in certain breeds or are inheritedin
specific breeds, and specific breed characteristicsuch as brachy-
cephaly and/or redundant skin folding have to be consid-

Materials and instruments
The instruments that should be available include a penlight, a
direct ophthalmoscope with a slit beam and a blue filter,Von
Graefe or other suitable forceps, a curette, and a spatula. Dis-
posable materials include the Schirmer tear test, fluorescein
as io sdis eluaq asu (sdop asop aus io) sis is
dose vials, and tubes containing transport medium for micro-
biological culturing. For ocular irrigation, O.9% NaCl solu-
tion in a soft plastic infusion bottle with a 2-mm cannula can
be used. Proparacaine, lidocaine, or tetracaine, which can cause
irritation during induction, can be used for topical anesthesia.
 Tropicamide can be used as a short-acting mydriatic. In pup-
 pies and kittens, and in adult animals or patients with apparent
congenital intraocular abnormalities, 0.5-1% atropine can be
used.

copurulent exudate,the Schirmer tear test (STT) is performed
(Plate 2.4).The test strip is grasped with a dry forceps and the
 round sterile end is placed in the ventral conjunctival sac about
one-third of the distance from the lateral canthus.After 60 sec-
onds, the strip is removed and the length of strip that has be-
come moistened, from the notch, is measured in millimeters.
The reference values are 13-23 mm in dogs, 10-20 mm in
cats, 20-30 mm in horses, and 15-20 mm in rabbits (Table 2.1).
Values of9 mm or less in dogs and 6 mm or less in cats indicate
keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS).56.7 If the value is between 10
and 13 mm in dogs or cats, rose bengal stain can be performed
after fluorescein staining has been completed. Rose bengal
staining reveals intact but devitalized epithelial cells in areas
where the tear film has broken down. However,this examina-
tion requires magnification, preferably a slit lamp (biomicro-

one hour, the specimen should be placed in transport medium
and kept refrigerated to prevent drying and thus the death of
the organisms.Afer collection of the sample, the conjunctival
sac is irrigated with 0.9% NaCl solution.

Eyelids (palpebrae)
During examination of the lids, ectropion or entropion may
be artificially corrected if the patient is restrained in a way that
places traction on the skin behind the lids (Plate 2.5).The lid
reflex and the apposition of the lid margins to the globe are 
inspected.The lid edges should be in contact with and follow
the curvature of the cornea.The margins should be hairless in
cats, while some eyelash hair is to be expected in dogs, horses,
and catle.The lid margins should also be pigmented, smooth,
glossy, and intact. Plate 2.6 shows the lid margins in a horse
with lashes on the upper lid as in humans. The lid margins
should be inspected for discoloration, swellings, alopecia, and
moisture. Scrapings are made of suspicious areas for examina
tion for parasites (demodex, sarcoptes). Defects in the lid mar-

ophthalmos). Wet, hairless, discolored areas may be due to
chronic blepharospasm.Suspected entropion can be confirmed
by the entropion test. For this purpose, a small skin fold, ap-
proximately 10-15 mm below the lower lid margin, is re-
tracted slightly so that the lid margin turns inwards and the
 outer edge lies against the cornea (Plate 2.8).This should be
corrected by a single blink, and its persistence indicates (ha-
bitual) entropion.
2.4.5
Conjunctiva
The conjunctiva is a thin, transparent membrane, through
which the sclera and subconjunctival tissues should be clearly
recognizable.The bulbar conjunctiva is usually very pale, espe-
cially in the cat.The palpebral conjunctiva is much redder in
appearance because of the arborization of its vessels. Because

 ment of the conjunctival vessels at the limbus. These vessels are
located more or less perpendicular to the limbus and they will
be seen to move with the conjunctiva when it is moved.
Chronic irritation by dust or bacteria causes a diffuse inflam-
matory redness, primarily in the lower conjunctival sac. The 
 conjunctiva is examined for abnormalities such as discolora-
tion, wetness,smoothness, or the presence of follicles (Plate 2.9).

ally against the orbital wall (not posteriorly toward the apex of
the orbit; this is retropulsion and does not measure indenta-
tion of the globe). When the spherical curvature of the globes
is felt,the globes are indented slightly so that the pressure is
perceived. This perception of the pressure can be compared
with that of a dog without ocular problems, or with that of the
 examiner. If manual tonometry is the only method available to
the practitioner, and glaucoma is suspected, the patient should
 be refered immediately Indentation (Schiotz) tonometry is
influenced by the different radius of the cornea in different
species and in different individuals, and of the globe during
the progress of glaucoma. However, it can be performed with
reasonable reliability when performed frequently and with
carefully cleaned equipment.Then it is more applicable to the
 management of this devastating disease than gross observation.
In addition,the Tonopen? (applanation tonometer) is available;
this can be used very effectively with practice, but is expensive.

2.4.11 Lens
During examination in the dark with the slit beam (Plate 13.3),
special attention is paid to the transparency, diameter, and form
of the lens. This examination should also be performed after
inducing total mydriasis (15-20 minutes after one drop of
0.5% tropicamide; in young animals 20-45 minutes after
1% atropine).

20 Diagnostics and Therapeuticsfor Eye Diseases
Care should always be taken to avoid touching the hairs around
the eye with the tip of the irrigation or dropper bottle, because
hair and dirt can be aspirated into the tip, thus contaminating
the contents (Plate 3.3). Ophthalmic drugs usually contain a
preservative; however they should not be used any later than
1 month after opening.

 The ventral cul-de-sac is used in large ani-
mals. Three millimeters of eye ointment
may be applied directly to the bulbar con-

sac.The tubing is attached along the mane crest to the shoul-
der area by suturing or using the mane itself From there, the
drug can be appliedby the use ofa syringe orinfusion pump.
Nowadays, commercial subpalpebral lavage systems are avail
able with a special footplate.They can be placed either in the
dorsolateral conjunctival sac or in the medioventral conjunc-
tival sac where the nictitating membrane willprotect the cor-
nea (Fig. 3.1 A, Plate 3.4).
 An alternative route is via a urine catheter (diameter 3-
 5 mm), which is introduced into the ostium of the nasolac-
rimal duct in the nose and fixed onto the ridge of the nose
(Fig. 3.1 B).
Either eye ointments or eye drops may be used. Drops are
simpler to administer and have less influence on vision. Their
duration of action, however, is very brief (about 5 minutes).
Two drops have the same duration of action as a single drop
and they are more likely to flow over the lid edge onto the
skin, so there is no advantage to the use of more than one drop.
Drops should be clear solutions; suspensions are less suitable.
Drops have a more lubricating and soothing effect and a longer
contact time (7-10 minutes) when they are viscous, i.e.based
 on artificial tears or gel or oil.
Eye ointments are active for a longer time than drops

Luxation of the globe refers to a dislocation of the globe
through lid fissures, as proptosis can be defined as frontal dis-
within this group include luxation of the globe as well as
burns, or blunt, superficial or perforating trauma to the lids,
conjunctiva, cornea, or the entire globe.
b) Ocular diseases which, because of their aggressiveness or
rapid development (1-2 days), can lead to severe pain, loss of
sight, or loss of the entire globe, and thus require direct treat-
ment. Examples of these include retrobulbar processes;1 ag-
gressive ulcers with melting edges (see 10.6.3.2), which may
perforate; anterior uveitis; glaucoma; lens luxation; and acute
blindness due to such causes as posterior uveitis, retinal de-
tachment, and involvement of the optic papilla and nerve by
hemorrhage, inflarmmation, or neoplasia. These diseases are
discussed in the subsequent relevant sections of this book, or-
 ganized on a morphologic and pathogenetic basis.
Trauma to the bony orbit, globe, and/or adnexa can be
caused by foreign bodies or by direct or indirect injuries in the
form of moderate or severe blows (automobile accidents or
even punishing blows from the owner),or from being stabbed,
shot, bitten, or scratched.

are used as a guide line for precise realignment. Horizontal or
vertical mismatching (Fig.4.4 and Plates 4.11, 4.12) of the
two parts of the lid edge are unacceptable. Small defects in the
conjunctiva rarely have to be sutured. Sometimes, non-perfo-
rating U-sutures can be used (see also 4.5.2).After the lid edge
has been closed, the most conspicuous points of the wound
(e.g. angles) are brought together with simple interrupted su-
placing additional sutures halfway between the previous su-
tures until the wound edges are adequately closed.This method
prevents unequal traction upon the wound edges. The maxi-
mal distance between sutures should not be more than 2 mm.
 After-care consists of applying topical antibiotic ointment to
 the eye and the wound. Other clinicians avoid topical therapy
and administer antibiotics parenterally If contarmination is
evident and concern about bacterial infection is present, cul-
ture and sensitivity tests are indicated.The veterinarian should
evaluate the progression of healing and modify the treatment
as necessary.

 owner to open the animal's mouth for examination, but very
carefully. Palpation of the soft floor of the orbit,behind the last
molar, sometimes reveals thickening and/or sensitivity to
pressure. Swelling of the optic disc can be expected if there is
pressure or inflammation around the optic nerve, but this is
difficult to confirm using monocular direct ophthalmoscopy.
Diagnosis: The differential diagnoses include all lesions aris-
ing from the orbit and the immediately adjacent tisues.The
diagnosis can only be confirmed satisfactorily by additional
examinations and/or biopsy and drainage. Simple diagnostic
procedures can include blood examinations (which may reveal
very high or low numbers ofleukocytes, or eosinophilia) and
 aspiration biopsy of the mandibular lymph node or, rarely, of
a peripherally located, fluctuating swelling. Only if the cytol-
ogy of the biopsy reveals evidence of metastasis is the diagno-
sis thereby completed. However, more complex procedures
are usually necessary to arrive at a definitive diagnosis, so the
patient must be referred.These procedures must be carried out
under general anesthesia and can include radiography in sev-
eral projections (also with contrast media to detect bone de-

of the cornea and conjunctiva, and hence it is not a primary
keratitis. KCS is usually caused by an inadequate production
of tears by the lacrimal glands, thus of the watery fraction, and
therefore the STT values are low and the tear film break-up
time is less than 20 sec.This deficiency can also occur because 
the tear film breaks up due to an abnormal composition (e.g.
 of the mucous layer). In these cases, there are often low-nor-
 mal STT values in addition to minor sicca signs.
There are many known causes of KCS:
1. KCS can be congenital and possibly inherited.
2. Traumatic injuries to the lacrimal glands or in the area of 
its innervation near the base of the ear can result in inflam-
mation and/or atrophy of the glands themselves or in a

 8. Autoimmune diseases resulting in a plasmacytic, lympho-

justifies using T-cell inhibitors for treatment. This is the
most frequent cause of KCS in the dog.Autoimmune and
degenerative diseases such as Sjogren's syndrome and the
dysautonomia syndrome have been reported to cause KCS.
Sjogren's syndrome, in which all mucous membranes are
excessively dry, is the most important cause of KCS in
humans. Sjogren's syndrome has also been described as a

Prognosis: The prognosis for healing of distinct, acute KCS
is relatively good, however, the prognosis for chronic KCS is
less favorable.The prognosis for KCS is often somewhat better
in cats than in dogs. Because only the smaller proportion of
 this group will heal completely, the majority of patients will 
need continuous veterinary care and thus, the owner must be
motivated to do so.

Tear stripe formation  65
6.4
Tear stripe formation
By means of the "zip-closure action"of the blinking of the lids
(Fig.6.3), tear fluid is moved towards the medial canthus,
where, if there is any functional obstruction to its drainage or
simply excessive production,it flows over the edge of the eye-
lid. If this situation persists, a tear stripe will form under the
 medial canthus; this being a brown-colored, moist stripe (tear
staining syndrome; Plate 6.7).In cats,small aggregates of pig-
mented material can be found between and on the hairs.Tear
 stripe formation can, therefore, be caused by a problem in the
 drainage of tear fluid or by overproduction of tears, or a com-
bination of the two. During the diagnosis, posible causes of
 Overproduction should be excluded first,such as medial entro-

should then be considered.These include:

The most important sign is chronic tear stripe formation.The
 passage offluorescein isretarded or absent.A lacrimal tear duct
cannula can only be introduced with difficulty or not at all,but
the passage is otherwise good (Fig. 6.6; Plate 6.8).
Therapy: Treatment consists of stretching the punctae with a
lacrimal dilator and irrigating the drainage apparatus with a
local anesthesia, but in most cats it is necessary to carry out the
 stretching and flushing under general anesthesia.

present in birds. Just outside the groove are the even srmaller
orifices of the glands of Zeis and Moll. The oily material se-
creted by these glands coats the margin of the lid with a lipid
layer, preventing the tear fluid from flowing across it. This se-
cretion also forms an extremely thin oily film on the watery
tear fluid, thereby reducing evaporation, whilst providing lu-
brication and preventing adhesion of debris.

or ophthalmia neonatorum (see 8.11.6) must be considered in
the differential diagnosis, but in these conditions the closed
eyelids will bulge as a result of the exudate that accumulates in
the closed pocket.
Therapy: Treatment consists of massaging the fissure cau-
tiously until it opens. If this fails, mechanical spreading with
mosquito forceps in the spontaneous first opening, or into the
groove of the future fissure starting in the medial canthus, will
open the fisure. Sometimes, a carefiul incision at the medial
canthus with a pointed scalpel is necessary.
 Postoperative treatment consists of topical "initial choice"
 antibiotic eye ointment, 4 times daily for 5 days.
Prognosis: The prognosis is favorable. There are no known
means of preventing this condition.

Aplasia palpebrae
In aplasia palpebrae or lid colobomas (Plate 7.1), the margins
of the eyelids are completely or partly undeveloped. This ano-
maly is congenital, most likely hereditary (recessive), and
usually bilateral, affecting the lateral part of the upper eyelid. It

rential diagnosis, but in these conditions no hairs arise from
the free lid margin.
Therapy: The simplest treatrment is manual epilation by
rounded tip epilation forceps at regular intervals; this can also
be performed by some owners.The advantage of this method
is that it allows detection of irritation caused by the hairs.
More permanent treatment by electro-epilation requires ge-
neral anesthesia and adequate magnification (x5-10) to detect
the orifice of the hair follicle.5 The hair follicle is destroyed by
means of a very thin steel wire (Plate 7.4; e.g. Perma Tweez),
which is introduced into its root (Fig. 7.5).
Note: Excessive coagulation must be avoided, as it will cause forma-
tion of irritating scar tissue on the free lid margin (Plate 7.5).
Other methods of treatment which have been advocated in-
clude the use of electroscalpel, high frequency radio-hyper-
thermia or cryosurgery on the conjunctival surface adjacent to
the follicle and destroying it.6.7 The use of the Perma Tweez

the base of the all meibomian glands can be excised (electric

Entropion  81
Therapy: In mild entropion, the cornea may be protected by a
topical lubricant. It is usually best to postpone surgical correc-
tion until the head has grown to full ize (1-2 years of age).In
 puppies lessthan 8-12 weeks old (mainly Shar Peis) with se-
vere entropion, a few sutures ("tacking"; Fig. 7.8; some clini-
cians use unnecessary irritating staples) can be placed to gather
up the skin of the lidandthereby evert the lid, thus preventing
corneal lesions.8 In some cases, the entropion will not require
further correction. Tacking causes scar forrmation, also after
removal of the stitches, resulting in correction of the entro-
pion and must thus be considered an operative entropion in-
tervention.

The edges of the wound should be joined together so

 operative swelling of the conjunctiva is normal and even desi-
rable because it keeps the eyelid margin off the cornea, which
is often still painful, thus allowing the cornea to heal quickly.

skin can be removed to counteract any tendency to develop
nasal folds, this without the risk of overcorrection (Fig. 7.13).

 In other breeds,the lid fissure should be shortened in the
lateral canthus.
7.13.2 Lateral canthoplasty
This is performed by a triangular resection of tissue at the la-
teral canthus with sliding skin, excising an adequate length of
tarsal glands in the lateral upper and lower lid margins, and
discarding it. This technique slides conjunctiva in one direc-
tion and the lid skin in the opposite direction. This forms a
wide scar and prevents postoperative separation.Closure is ac-
complished by closing the conjunctiva with continuous (8-0
absorbable) sutures, and suturing the lateral canthus wound
over it.28
 These methods require much more experience on the part
 of the surgeon; therefore it may be best to refer these pa-
tients.

be considered in the differential diagnosis.
Carcinomas are usually flat, slow-growing, ulcerating de-
fects at or near the margin of the eye lid.They may initially
show as a hyperemic area with some dark exudate. They are
often accompanied by neoplasms on other parts of the body
(e.g. ears,lips).In horses, the ulcerating area will usually slowly
 progress to a more cauliflower-shaped, granulating deformity.
Diagnosis: Diagnosis is established by means of biopsy or, in 
 the case of small neoplasms, by direct radical excision.

anesthesia, the lid margin is everted (e.g. with chalazion
forceps). In neoplasia involving only one or more glands,radi-
cal excision is necessary If more than approximately 10% of
the lid length is involved (normal lid fisure length eye),this is
followwed by a blepharoplasty (Figs. 7.22-7.26). Cryosurgery is
also possible, but may cause long-term depigmentation and
leave a lid margin defect.The neoplasia itself should never be
squeezed during surgery, as this may cause artifacts for the
histopathologist. The neoplasm itself can be stored in 5%
formaldehyde, but it is best sent directly for histopathologic
evaluation.
The treatment of larger neoplasms or neoplasms with distinct
aspects of malignancy, or recurrences consists of a radical re-
moval of the neoplasm. These methods usually require more
extensive blepharoplasties, so it may be best to refer these pa-
tients. When large or multiple parts of the eyelid margin have
to be removed, cryotherapy laser therapy,33 or high frequency
e.g. with BCG,34 can be considered.

 Non-pigmented margin of
the nictitating membrane 
If the free margin of the nictitating membrane is non-pig-
mented, it may be extremely sensitive to sunlight, resulting in
erythema and edema of the margin.
Therapy: If there are only minor symptoms of irritation,
treatment consists of topical steroid drops, 1-2 times daily for
2-5 days. In severe cases, black tattooing of the exposed nicti-
tating membrane can be tried or the margin may be shortened
by 2-3 mm.The wound is sutured with 8-0 absorbable suture
material.The knots are embedded subconjunctivally. Removal
of the nictitating membrane for cosmetic effects is not justi-
fiable und must be rejected in favor of the patient's welfare (for
the reasons given in the Introduction of this chapter).

Ectopic cilia 
Ectopic cilia in the conjunctiva (Fig. 8.1, Plate 8.4) occur sin-
gy or in a tuft and grow towards the cornea from a hair folli-
cle below the conjunctiva.° In most cases, they are located at
the base of the meibomian glands and only rarely are they to
be found in the nictitating membrane. As soon as the hair

penetrates the conjunctiva, it causes severe irritation of the

Protrusion of the nictitating mermbrane may be caused by
 many abnormalities. The nictitating membrane will protrude
 over the globe in cases of
(1) loss of sympathetic innervation (5.4.2, 12.12), as found in 
Plate 8.4:
Horner's Syndrome or feline dysautonomia;
Ectopic cilia (see arrow) in the conjunctiva of the upper lid (Os, dog).
(2) processes which press the globe into the orbit,such as frac-
tures;
(3) active or passive enophthalmos, as may be caused by pain
in the eye, loss of retrobulbar fat, or atrophy ofthe chewing
muscles;
(4) space-occupying processes at the base of the third eyelid;
or
(5) swelling or symblepharon of the nictitating membrane it-
self.

110 Conjunctiva and Nictitating Membrane
Therapy: Inflarmmation, with or without infection, is not the
primary cause and thus treatment with corticosteroids, with or
without antibiotics, is not effective. Also, since it accounts for
a significant part of the tear production, neither the gland nor
the entire nictitating membrane should be removed. The re-
moval of the entire nictitating membrane because of this indi-
cation must be considered a professional mistake.
 The purpose of treatment is to relocate the inverted gland
in its normal position. Several methods are available (see be-
low), none of which being entirely effective. Some can even
introduce a severe risk of perforating the sclera. In all of these
methods, the base of the cartilage is anchored to the peri-
osteum of the medial inferior orbital wall;or the glanditselfis

 114 Conjunctiva and Nictitating Membrane
8.11.1
Catarrhal (or serous)
conjunctivitis
In catarrhal conjunctivitis, serous exudate is mixed with the
tear film. The film's viscosity increases and lacrimal drainage
decreases, resulting in epiphora and tear stripe formation be-
low the medial canthus.The serous reaction may be caused by
wind, dust, ammoniac from dirty cage bottoms or allergens.
Other causes are acute infections such as upper respiratory
disease or infectious rhinitis in cats caused by FHV-1, Myco-
plasma spp., and Chlamydia spp.12,13.14 The serous reaction is
followed by the production of more mucus and more desqua-
mated epithelial cells.
 Catarrhal conjunctivitis is characterized by epiphora,red-
nes, slight swelling, and mucus discharge. In the acute phase,
epiphora is especially prominent, while in the chronic phase
(after 12 weeks), redness, swelling, and discomfort increases.

116 Conjunctiva and Nictitating Membrane
8.11.3 Follicular conjunctivitis
Lymphoid follicles may develop as a reaction to primary in-
fections (e.g feline upper respiratory disease), chronic rrita-
tion (dust), or hypersensitivity (pollen).They are 0.5-3 mm in
diameter, pale, glassy, and red at the base.Almost every follicle
has its own capillary. Follicles are most frequently located on
the ocular conjunctiva of the nictitating membrane, between
the outer margin of the nictitating membrane and the gland.
The area adjacent to the edge of the cartilage is most 
often affected in folliculitis in cats.
The presence of a few small follicles, especially in young ani-
mals, is normal. More follicles are often seen as a consequence
of an earlier episode of irritation (pollen, viral infection). If
many follicles develop, they may become a confluent field on

Neoplasia of the conjunctiva
 Neoplasms of the conjunctiva are rare.21 Papillomas often take
the form of pinkish-red, cauliflower-shaped nodules, about
5 mm in diameter, which appear almost to drift on the surface
of the conjunctiva (Plate 8.18).The treatment consists of sur-
gical removal of the neoplasm together with the conjunctiva
at its base.
 Malignant neoplasms often cause more diffuse swelling,
especially at the base of the nictitating membrane and are fre-
quently accompanied by exophthalmos. The most frequent
neoplasms are squarmous cell carcinomas (Plate 8.19),but lym-
 phosarcoma, mastocytoma, and other neoplasms also occur.
Bilateral involvement is most likely to be due to lymphosar-
coma.
Unexplained pigmented or non-pigmented swellings
should be examined microscopically by means of fine needle
aspiration biopsy, or by surgical biopsy or excision.They may
also be further localized by MRI or CT scanning.

ches, having neither a myelin sheath nor Schwann cells, pene-
trate between the epithelial cells.
The shape of the limbus in most animals is circular to ho-
rizontally oval as observed in ungulates. In horses,the perilim-
bal cornea frequently appears white; some authors attribute
this to the pectinate ligament/ trabecular system not being
totally covered by the sclera.The opaque sclera (tunica fibrosa),
which is white except for a slight pigmentation in the limbal
area, forms the rest of the outer tunica of the eye.The sclera is
thickest (1.5 mm) in the area of the venous plexus, 3-10 mm
behind the limbus, and is thinnest (0.2 mm) at the equator,
becoming thicker again as it approaches the exit of the optic
nerve.
 In order to function as a window and as part of a strongly
refractive medium, the cornea must be transparent. It is clear
because of the regularity of the collagen fibrils of the stroma
 at about 81% hydration, and its avascularity. A stable hydration
 of the cornea is maintained mainly by a pumping mechanism
 in the endothelium. The cornea is still relatively "dehydrated";
56
when the endothelium is damaged the cornea takes up a great
amount of water, which increases its thickness 34 times.

velops at the periphery of superficial defects. The defect
will be stained by fluorescein which can penetrate into and
between the damaged epithelial and stromal cells (Pla-

drophobic) structure which will not stain with fluorescein.

the ciliary muscles.

rescein (Plates 10.12, 10.14). Thus, an edermatous area in
 the cornea with a clear centerindicates that only Descemet's 
membrane and the endothelium of the cornea protect
against perforation. If the membrane becomes thinner or
the pressure in the eye increases, the mermbrane bulges out
to form a hernia (descemetocele) which makes the crater
look less deep. Very slight trauma, even manual measure-
ment of the pressure in the eye, will then be enough to
cause perforation.
 Perforation: If the cornea is perforated, the aqueous hu-
 mor escapes through the opening. It coagulates within a
short time and thus closes the opening. If the defect is
larger, a piece of the iris usually lodges in the opening and
closes it (staphyloma; Plates 4.19, 10.15). The piece of iris
becomes covered with exudate and later with epithelium.
Fibroangioblastic tissue forms directly via the vessels of the

corneal scar that is adherent to the iris (anterior synechia,

 Microcornea, which is a cornea of too small a diameter, occurs
almost exclusively in microphthalmia (see 9.7).
10.3
Persistent pupillary
membrane (PPM)
If remnants of the embryonal pupillary or epipupillary mem-
brane adhere to the endothelium of the cornea and are not
absorbed,they will lead to scars on the inner side of the cornea
(Plates 4.18, 10.2, 12.1, 12.2). This material is usually dense
and white, comparable to scleral tissue or boiled egg-white.
There may also be threads of tisue between the scar and the
iris (1-2 mm outside the edge of the pupil). During changes
in the size of the pupil, these can cause traction on the endo-
 thelium. The traction and scar influence the normal function
ing of the endothelium, resulting in local edema of the over-
lying cornea. Often,patients with these problems are presented

The outer cornea and conjunctiva are continuously exposed
not only to noxious materials such as wind, dust, and micro-
organisms, but also to other sources of irritation such as hairs
of the animal itself (e.g.trichiasis, entropion, distichiasis), espe-
cially in dogs. This type of problem often provides the port of
entry for other factors (e.g. bacteria or fungi) to colonize and
cause disease. Iatrogenic problems can also develop as a result

Conjunctival pedicle flap oversuturing
(Fig. 10.9 AB)

In this method,the conjunctiva is cut free along the limbus
over a distance of 10-15 mm. The bulbar conjunctiva is
freed in such a way that the flap can be laid over the defect
without tension. Only the conjunctiva should be freed and
 not the underlying Tenon's capsule. This means that the
tips of the scissors must rermain visible through the con-
junctiva. The free edge of the conjunctival flap is sutured

 Conjunctival strip oversuturing (Fig. 10.9 CD;
Plate 10.21) In this method, the conjunctiva is freed along
the limbus from 12 to 6 o'clock on the same side of the
 cornea as the defect.A second incision is made in the con-
junctiva parallel to the first over an arc of about 150 de-
grees. The width of the resulting conjunctival strip should
be 5 mm wider than the corneal defect.After the conjunc-
tiva has been freed, the result is a vertical strip that is only
attached at the top and bottom.The free edges of the strip
are sutured to the medial and lateral edges of the defect
(suture material of 8-0 or 9-0, as in the previous me-
thod).
The remaining conjunctival wound edge may be attached
at the limbus with a continuous suture, especially inhorse
(risk for retrobulbar fat prolapse).Alternatively,it is possible
to loosen the strip over a smaller circle (e.g. 100 degrees)
and to cut the strip loose at one end, thus creating a
 pedicle less broad based than in the previous technique
(Plates 10.19, 10.20).

 Bulbar conjunctiva oversuturing
(Fig.10.8; Plates 10.16-10.18)
The conjunctiva is cut all along the limbus for 360 degrees
and freed from the Tenon's capsule. The conjunctiva at
12 o'clock and 6 o'clock is brought together and attached
with a flat mattress suture (5-0 or 6-0 silk or nylon, round
body needle) or one circular suture.The remainder of the
conjunctiva is joined with a few mattress sutures so that a
mediolateral seam results.This method is simpler than the
first two and can cover large defects, but is less specific and
more traumatic.
 Conjunctival free autotransplant
A piece of conjunctiva, a little larger than the corneal de-
fect, is freed and excised, e.g.from the outside of the nic-
 titating membrane. This conjunctival transplant is attached
with simple interrupted sutures (9-0 nylon) to cover or fill 
the defect. This method is more likely to be successful if
the ulcer is already distinctly vascularized.

form of opacification and necrosis of the underlying and sur-
rounding corneal epithelium and stroma. The pain reaction in
cats is usually not very severe but there is overproduction of
tears and protrusion of the nictitating membrane. Superficial
ingrowth of vessels develops slowly. Over the course of many
months to a year, most sequestrums are extruded very gradu-
ally by means of granulation under the plaque.The sequestra-
tion process may also go deeper until perforation ocurs, indi-
cating the need for early surgical intervention. A corneal scar
usually remains.

Keratitis  149
The sequestrum does not stain with fluorescein (although it
 does with rose bengal), but the necrotic ring around the plaque
 may be lightly stained.
Therapy: Treatment is with an "initial choice” antibiotic-Vi-
tamin A ointment. Because spontaneous extrusion of the se-
questrum requires a very long time, the authors prefer referral
 for lamellar keratectomy (some clinicians wait for spontaneous
healing).
A keratectomy is carried out under both general and local
anesthesia, the latter reducing the depth of the former. It is
necessary to use at least x5-10 magnification,a capsule forceps,
and a special round-tip diamond knife.A more complete set
of instruments should be readily available for complications
such as perforation.The incision is directed under the seques-
trum from the healthy corneal tissue just outside it.The plaque
is then loosened from the underlying stroma using spatula dis-
section.

(Epi)scleritis is a benign,sterile, proliferative inflammation that
causes one or more nodular, or more diffuse, swellings in the
episcleral tissue.33 (Epi)scleritis occurs particularly in middle-
aged or older dogs.

 In gangliosidosis, complex lipids accumulate, for example, in

substances has been described in kittens with progressve cor-

Neoplasms 155
10.9
Neoplasms
Primary or secondary neoplasms arising from the cornea and /
 or sclera occur sporadically.They should not be confused with
 benign processes such as (epi)scleritis or eosinophilic keratitis.
 If any process in this area does not appear to correspond with
the disorders described above, neoplasia should be considered.
Abnormalities that are associated with irregular, trongly pig
mented or pinkish-white, firm or lardaceous tissue proli-
feration are particularly suspect. In dogs, limbal melanomas
(Plate 10.33) are found infrequently, and they are usually rela-
tively benign.34
In horses and cattle, carcinomas may also
spread to the cornea and sclera (Plate 10.34).
 Careful slit-lamp microscopic examination
 and biopsy are then necessary.

contrast to glaucoma, miosis and a lowered or normal IOP are
to be expected. Secondary glaucoma can occur after healing 
due to the sequelae of an inflarmmatory insult, i.e. posterior
synechia or compromised angle. Exophthalmos is generally
caused by a retrobulbar mass, which does not increase the IOP
but rather the retrobulbar pressure.
 Buphthalmos can also occur as a result of a massive intra-

If glaucoma cannot be controlled satisfactorily by medical
 treatment, the patient is usually referred for surgical treatment.
Unfortunately, none of the various surgical methods have
 proved to be optimal.

horizontal layer of blood cells in the anterior chamber. The

can continue for 2 weeks to 6 months or longer. During the
illness, lens changes frequently develop. Consequently, the
most important cause of cataract (Plate 12.12) and lens luxa-

chorioretinitis, and even retinal detachment and phthisis bulbi
in equines are frequently due to ERU. The abnormalities can
be found in one or both eyes.
 Therapy: Due to blepharospasm at the beginning of the at-

therapy can consist ofinstalling a subpalpebral lavage system in
the conjunctival sac for topical treatment, and of systermic

 possible to differentiate between primary and secondary neo-
plasia, with the exception of early primary neoplasms, which
rarely result in inflammatory disease until the mass outgrows
its blood supply In contrast, metastatic neoplasia more fre-
quently results in signs of inflammation. The first signs of a
 primary uveal neoplasm are focal color change (usually pig-
mentation) and swelling of the iris tissue without associated
signs of uveitis. For example, the surface of the iris and the
edge of the pupil can be deformed but remain sharply outli-
ned. If the neoplasm originates from the ciliary body,the base
of the iris at that location may protrude into the anterior
chamber (Plate 12.17). Eventually, the pinkish-white tissue
behind the edge of the pupil will become visible. Basically,the
rule is the more extensive the neoplasm, the greater the like-
lihood of signs of secondary uveitis (exudate, redness). It is also
 possible that the increase in tissue is more or less uniform and
circular. Sometimes, the neoplasm is in the drainage angle, so 
that the mass is only discovered when it leads to secondary

13.2.2 Persistent hyaloid artery (PHA)
follow the advice given in 15.The breeding of affected animals
and their immediate family members is discouraged.
 PHA is due to a lack of regression of part or all of the HA.The
artery can remain present as a string,still containing blood,
between the optic disc and the lens, though usually only a
small connective tissue string remains adhered to the posterior
capsule of the lens. During movements of the eye, this string-
13
like structure lags slightly behind and so can have a waving
motion, which is best observed in the beam ofa slit lamp. Scars
 or densities also often occur where the PHA is attached to the
capsule of the lens (just under the center of the suture lines of
the lens) and in the immediately surrounding area. In more
severe cases, these scars can also lead to cataract formation in
the connecting lens fibers. The abnormality can be inherited
(as in the Sussex Spaniel).
Therapy: Larger cataracts caused by a persisting hyaloid artery
can be removed by extra capsular lens extraction,including
 posterior central capsulorrhexis. However, there is more risk
for intra- and post-operative complications, such as vitreous
 prolapse.

disorder is bilateral, inherited (probably incomplete domi-

anesthesia has the great advantage that the eye does not recede
into the orbit and turn away. In dogs,and to a lesser extend in
cats, however, this form of anesthesia is much less easily con-

the globe and enophthalmos occur. To prevent this, it is neces-
sary to use inhalation anesthesia and a muscle relaxant (such as
[cis]atracurium, norcuronium or vecuronium). Since the re-
spiratory muscles are also affected with this type of anesthesia,
it is necessary to provide artificial respiration. During manipu-

If multiple fibers are ruptured, vitreous can leak via the
posterior chamber over the edge of the pupil into the anterior
chamber (Fig. 13.11). If the fibers are ruptured over a greater
area, subluxation will occur. If the lens becomes completely
loose, it can remain more or less in its normal position or it
can be displaced anteriorly or posteriorly. The lens and /or the
vitreous can thus block the drainage of the aqueous in the
pupil or at the level of the drainage angle, resulting in se-
condary glaucoma. Secondary glaucoma occurs usually less
acutely and less rapidly in cats than in dogs. Cats can have a
lens luxation for a longer time without developing glau-
coma.
Symptoms: The earliest recognizable sign of lens subluxation
is leakage of vitreous, which hangs over the edge of the pupil
and into the anterior chamber like very thin white clouds
(Fig. 13.11; Plate 13.11). If the lens is displaced, an aphakic
crescent (Plate 13.12) will develop between the edge of the
 pupil and the lens equator, andlight penetrating this opening
can reflect the color of the tapetum lucidum. If the lens is
displaced anteriorly (Plates 13.12-13.15), the iris is pressed

Vitreous floaters
Vitreous floaters, mouche volantes, muscae volitantes, or flit-
ting flies are larger flakes or streaks in the vitreous that may or
may not move. If they are very moveable, and especially if
something resembling a fly is passing by In humans, they can
be a sign of tear-induced retinal detachment or chorioretinitis.
These abnormalities rarely occur in animals, and seldomly re-
quire treatment, though they may induce misbehavior (jittery
horses).
13.5.2 Asteroid hyalosis
 In this condition (Plate 13.16),there are many small (<1 mm),
possibly slightly pigmented, particles in the vitreous of one or
 both eyes.These move during and after movement of the eye,
but return to their original place. They seldom influence vi-
sion.

 Fundus and Optic nerve
14.1
Introduction 
The fiundus of the eye is considered to be the posterior aspect
of the inner eye as seen ophthalmoscopically (Fig. 14.1; Pla-
tes 14.1, 14.3-14.9). Many abnormalities in this area reside in
the tunica nervosa (interna or retina) and the tunica vasculosa
(choroid) or the optic nerve, but seldom in the tunica fibrosa
(sclera).
14.1.1 0ntogenesis
 The development of the eye begins with an outgrowth of the
neuroectodermal tissue of the neural tube and the surroun-
ding mesoderm to just beneath the surface ectoderm. The
retina and optic nerve develop from this neuroectoderm. In-
folding of the optic vesicle results in a double-walled ocular

teriorly, the retina (pigment epithelium) continues as the epi-
thelium of the ciliary body and posterior epithelium of the
iris. The space between the sensory retina and the pigment
epithelium disappears, but the layers do not become fused.
 Extensions (axons) of the ganglion cells converge as they grow
out to the inner covering of the closing central eye stalk and
14
make contact with the brain as the optic nerves. The mesen-
chymal tissue around the ocular cup fiuses with the uvea and
the surrounding sclera. The tapetum lucidum (or non-tapetal
area) is formed in the choroid between the 5th and 8th week
after birth (dog and cat) (Plates 14.3, 14.4).
14.1.2 Retina
The retina consists of an inner and an outer layer (Fig. 14.2).
 The inner or neuroretina can be subdivided into three
 major and nine sublayers.The three major layers are:ganglion
cell layer, second order neurons or transmitter cells, and the
photoreceptors.
More precisely, the neuroretina consists from vitreous to
 choroid of the following layers:
1. Inner limiting membrane
2.
 Nerve fiber layer (ganglion cell axons)
3.
 Ganglion cell layer

Light stimulation of the retina results in a series of photo-
 chemical reactions accompanied by changes in potentials In
light-stimulated photoreceptors, the photopigment of the i-
 pid membranes of the rods and cones is activated and later
regenerated. The degree of activation of the visual pigments
 depends on the intensity, duration and wave length of the light
stimulus.

 of the papilla, while the veins pass clearly more to the center
where they may partly anastomose. The main vessels of the
retina in cats and dogs spread more or less to the 3-, 12- and
9-0'-clock positions in a *T' form In cats,the leg of the T
 passes medially to the papilla, approximately in the direction
of the temporally located central area. In dogs, in comparison,
the leg of the T points vertically upwards. The other vessels
ermbrace the central area. In horses,the very thin retinal vessels
 spread roughly like the rays of the sun from the papilla. They
are visible over approximately the length of one optic disc
diameter.

Coloboma
A fundus coloboma is a defect in the closure of the posterior
wall of the eye (Fig. 14.4). With the outgrowth of neural tissue
around the hyaloid artery, the seam of closure is located ven-
tromedial to the papilla (6-o'clock position); therefore, a typi-
cal coloboma is usually located ventromedial in or below the
 papilla (Plates 14.17, 14.18). However, atypical colobomas oc-
cur elsewhere. Colobomas are usually round to oval and can
vary in diameter from one quarter to as much as 4 times the

chance. Colobomas are regularly found as part of the Collie

Retinal dysplasia (RD)
In this condition,parts of the retina and usually also the cho-
 roid are underdeveloped or abnormally developed (differential
growth rates) (Plates 14.14-14.16).The retina has folds or be-
comes detached over larger areas. RD occurs in the dog, cat,
horse and birds of prey The abnormality is thought to be in-
herited recessively.
Mild or (multi) focal forms of RD result in the formation
of folds or rosettes in the inner layer of the retina (Plates 14.14,
14.15). Small folds can sometimes flatten out in the first
months of life, especially in Collies. The mild forms have no
evident influence on vision.The abnormality is known to oc-
 cur in several dog breeds, such as the American Cocker Spa-
niel,21 Collie, Rottweiler,22 Beagle,23 and Labrador Retriever.

In this disorder (Plate 14.22), the targeted tissue is the RPE.As
a result there is an accumulation of lipid pigments in the RPE
and, later, elsewhere in the retina. It is possible that this is
caused by an inadequate phagocytosis of the outer segment

ceptors then develops, beginning with the cones. Ultimately.
 there is degeneration of the entire retina.The abnormality has
been diagnosed in many breeds and predominantly in Great
Britain.The abnormality has been confirmed in the Briard,56
Golden and Labrador Retrievers, Collies, Shetland Sheepdog,
English Cocker and Springer Spaniels, and the Cardigan Welsh
Corgi .Apart from this, PED seldom occurs. Recently, strong
evidence was presented showing that vitamin E and taurine
are involved in the etiology of PED, with a familial predispo-
sition.57 The abnormality had been hitherto thought to be
transmitted as an autosomal recessive (possibly dominant in
the Labrador Retriever).

2005. 248 pages, 182 illustrations, 7 1/2 x 10 1/4", hardcover
ISBN 978-3-87706-635-5
Ear, Nose, Throat, and Tracheobronchial Diseases in Dogs and Cats is the first textbook to provide a complete
overview of all ENT diseases, both common and rare. It includes such problems as inflammation of the outer
ear, deafness, nasal discharge, swallowing disorders, and cough. Detailed and up to date clinical information
gives insight into ENT function and dysfunction for teachers and researchers, veterinarians in practice and
veterinary students.
Six chapters give key information on functional considerations, aetiology, clinical signs, diagnosis, and therapy
of ENT disorders. Special diagnostic and imaging techniques are described in detail.
 About 180 top quality illustrations emphasize and supplement the specific features of the diseases and
disorders described in the text. A detailed index gives easy access to the content of this book.
This unique textbook will provide a highly useful and informative reference guide to everyday practice, based
on the author's 35 years as a specialist in ear, nose, throat, and tracheobronchial diseases in companion
 animals.

Second Edition
 2004. 568 pages, 790 radiographs, 50 tables, 8 1/2 x 11", hardcover
ISBN 978-3-89993-008-5
The totally revised second edition of this comprehensive atlas describes and explains the uses of diagnostic radiology and provides detailed 
instructions on how best to apply this technique to the diagnosis of traumatized dogs and cats, indluding a range of emergency cases. The 
main focus of the revised concept is the descriptive presentation of clinical cases.
"The images in this text are exemplary and reproduction is of a high quality. There are multiple radiographs and presentations of a single
condition, which realistically refects the various presentations of the traumatised patient. It is a radiography atlas which would be useful
tool for any veterinarian who does a lot of emergency work and a useful adjunct to a standard radiology textbook for any veterinary
student."
