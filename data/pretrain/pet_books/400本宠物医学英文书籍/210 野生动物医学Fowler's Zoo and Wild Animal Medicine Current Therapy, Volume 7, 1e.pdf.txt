INFECTIOUS DISEASES
Various herpesviruses are known to be responsible
for disease outbreaks in mixed species exhibits. Other
viruses such as rabies or bacteria (e.g., Mycobacterium
tuberculosis complex) or a variety of endoparasite, ecto-
parasite, or fungal infections (e.g., aspergillosis) may
each be detrimental in mixed exhibits, because not only
one species will be infected, as in single-species exhibits.

In addition, water and wind erosion may expose

remnants of previous anthrax victims. Alternatively,
spores may be brought to the surface by large- or small-
scale seismic events.
Transmission of anthrax relies on the ingestion of
infected spores or parental inoculation of spores. Inges-
tion of spores is generally associated with drinking from
a contaminated water source or ingesting contaminated
grazing, browse, flesh, or bones; oral infection is prob-
ably the most common route of infection in wild
animals. In predators and porcines, edematous lesions

Whenever the use of drains is indicated but not fea-

this open space should be in the dependent part of the

Closure Techniques
In conventional zoo animal surgery, one of the main
concerns arises when closing the wound because of
recurrent wound suture dehiscence. The excessive
tension is particularly important, so some of the follow-

CONCLUSION
There is little opportunity to evolve technically while
 sible for monitoring developments in the various felds
of surgery and any resources that may be applied through
 suitable adaptation, in addition to performing surgeries
on a regular basis. Having the opportunity to perform
 surgery in other species may be valuable for achieving 
those goals.
As a zoo veterinarian, one cannot overlook specific
knowledge about the anatomy, physiology, and specific
behaviors of zoo animals as an essential contribution
for one's practice as a zoo surgeon. The work performed

INFECTIOUS DISEASES
Two infectious diseases, the fungus Batrachochytridium
implicated as contributing factors of global amphibian
declines.5718 There are no published reports of ranavirus 
prevalence in wild populations of hellbenders; however,
 ongoing research at the University of Tennessee, Knox-
ville Zoo, and University of Georgia has documented
infection. In this study, ranavirus prevalence ranged
from 25% to 65% in wild hellbender populations
inhabiting two eastern Tennessee watersheds.22 The
occurrence or degree of ranaviral disease or chytridio-
mycosis in infected individuals is unknown because
animals were not collected for necropsy.

PATHOLOGY
Pathologic studies continue to be performed for the
entire population by the Zoological Society of San Diego,
with the exception of several birds that were suspected
to have been killed in the wild, and necropsies were
performed by the government for legal purposes. Mortal-
ity data for released birds from the beginning of the
release program until 2002 have been published.25 A

In cockatoos, the powder-down feathers, or
pulviplumes, are often the first feathers affected. PBFD-
affected pulviplumes are fragile or develop an abnor
mally thickened outer sheath that fails to disintegrate.
 Pulviplume follicles may atrophy and thus create bare
powder-down patches. Arrested production of powder
down causes the plumage to become dull and the beak
to become glossy. Claw abnormalities occur occasion-

usually affecting the powder-down feathers first in cock-

AND POPULATION
Before the arrival of DFTD, Tasmanian devils did not
usually breed before their second year with, 0% to
12.5% of 1-year-old females breeding. Because the
disease has now killed most mature age devils, precocial
 breeding has increased to 13.3% to 83.3% of 1-year-old
females, depending on region. Whereas devils previ-
ously would produce a litter each year for 3 years until
reproductive senescence set in after 5 years, devils in
 affected areas now only live long enough to produce

Further Diagnostic Considerations
In animals euthanized because of blindness during an
outbreak in the endemic areas of Australia, the histo-
pathologic lesions are pathognomonic. For isolated
cases with similar pathology, PCR or immunoperoxi-
dase testing should be used as confrmatory tests.
Contact CSIRO, Australian Animal Health Laboratory,

specifc testing. In live animals with clinical signs, posi-
tive serologic results are not helpful because many unaf-

seroconversion. However, fundic changes are not seen
for at least a further 2 weeks, suggesting an immuno-
logic pathogenesis for the retinal damage. The pathol-
ogy of acutely affected kangaroos supports this
contention. Acute retinal degeneration coincident with
a subacute to chronic lymphoplasmacytic choroiditis
implies that choroidal changes may precede the retinal
lesions. The anatomy of the macropod eye, with a
paucity of retinal vessels such that the retina is more
 dependent on choroidal blood supply than in eutherian
mammals, might predispose to retinal damage second-
ary to choroidal inflammation. Although wallal virus

TREATmENt, PREVENTION,
AND CONTROL
Assuming an immunologic pathogenesis, local or
systemic corticosteroid  treatment might be helpful
to reduce retinal damage in acute cases, but this is
unproven. Currently, no treatment is practical, and
retinal damage is permanent. However, animals with
limited sight may adapt, especially in captivity, where
their needs are well met; even blind wild animals in

equipment also coincided with the recruitment of vol-
untary clinical veterinary advisors within the AZA ape
SSPs and taxon advisory group (TAG), enhanced prom-
ulgation of standardized AZA husbandry recommenda-
tions and veterinary examination protocol guidelines,
and greater accessibility to inhalational anesthetic pro-
tocols. Such efforts led to more frequent routine physi-
cal examinations, including cardiac evaluations, in most
SSP-managed captive apes, by 2000.
CURRENTLY IDENTIFIED TYPES
Several types of CVD are seen in apes, but the most
common entity, based on published reports and
analyses of SSP necropsy data, is characterized by
an idiopathic scattered pattem of "myocardial replace-

are subtle. Histologically (Figs. 53-2 and 53-3), patholo-

hyalinized (arteriosclerosis). Larger coalescent areas of
dissecting fbrosis may extend throughout the walls
of all chambers, but not to the extent seen with myocar-
dial infarction resulting from major coronary vessel
occlusion. In many cases, the heart is enlarged with left
ventricular hypertrophy, but in some cases the heart may
be dilated and flabby. Myocardial fbrosis, per se, is an
end-stage lesion, which does not imply a particular eti-
ology or pathogenetic mechanism. It can develop as a

human deaths in the Democratic Republic of Congo,
Republic of Congo, Gabon, Uganda, and Sudan.17
Recent findings of ZEBOV seropositivity in rural people
in Gabon have raised the question of its pathogenicity
 in humans. Bundibugyo ebolavirus,the most recently dis-
covered species, caused a human outbreak in Uganda in
2007, with a 34% case-fatality rate.23 The sole confrmed
human ClEBOV case, which was nonfatal, resulted from
exposure during the necropsy of a CIEBOV-infected
chimpanzee in Cote d'lvoire in 1994. Although the
recent discovery of REBOV in domestic swine in the
Philippines raises public health concerns, it has not
been shown to be pathogenic for humans.3

TREATMENT
Therapeutic measures include conservative and surgical
treatment or a combination of both. Glucocorticoids are
used to reduce the swelling or edema of brain tissue and
neurologic signs may improve because of decompres-
sion and pain relief. The typical initial dose of dexa-
methasone is 2 to 3 mg/kg/day, which may later be
reduced to 0.2 mg/kg/day. Alternatively, prednisone was

Catheter Placement
 1. Place appropriate catheter, as per protocol, into jugular vein.
 2. Through the needle catheters may take longer to place initially but they are usually more secure and last longer than
traditional over the needle catheters.
