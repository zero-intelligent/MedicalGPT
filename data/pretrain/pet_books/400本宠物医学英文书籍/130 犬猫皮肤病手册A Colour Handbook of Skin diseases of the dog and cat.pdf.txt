PREFACE
Veterinary dermatology has had an exponential growth in information since publica
tion of the first edition of A Color Handbook of Shin Diseases of the Dog and Cat in
1998. This has necessitated a complete revision of all the chapters and the inclusion
of twenty-one new diseases. In addition, one hundred and thirty-one new illustra
tions of dermatologic diseases have been added. The authors have tried to provide
the relevant information concerning the diagnosis and treatment of dermatologic
diseases in such a format that it is easily accessible by the busy practitioner.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The authors would like to acknowledge the support given by their families through
the sacrifices they have made to allow us time to complete this book. We are also
 grateful for the wonders of modern technology, without which this book would not
have come to fruition. Finally, we would like to thank the referring veterinarians who
have trusted their dermatologic cases to us so that we could accumulate the
knowledge and experience necessary to undertake the writing of this book.

10 Introduction
Terminology used
in the description of
dermatologic lesions
PRIMARY LESIONS
Primary lesions are directly associated with the
disease process. They are not pathognomonic,
but give a valuable clue as to the type of disease
process occurring.
Macules are flat areas of discoloration up to
I cm (0.4 in) in diameter, whereas patches are
larger than I cm in diameter Changes can involve 
increased blood flow (erythema),extravasated
blood (hemorrhagic petechiae and ecchymoses),
or pigment changes.Erythema can be
distinguished from hemorrgage by blanching on
digital pressure or using a glass slide (diascopy).
Papules are small, solid, elevated lesions up to
I cm (0.4 in) in diameter associated with cell
infiltration and/or proliferation, in this case a
mast cell tumor.
A plaque is a flat, solid, elevated lesion of more
than I cm (0.4 in) in diameter, again associated
with cell infiltration and/or proliferation.
The lesions illustrated are eosinophilic plaques
on a cat.
Introduction 11
A nodule is a solid elevation of the skin greater
than I cm (0.4 in) in diameter, again associated
with cell infiltration and/or proliferation. The
nodule illustrated is a mast cell tumor on the
abdomen of a dog. A tumor is a large nodule,
although not necessarily neoplastic.
A tumor is a large growth. A lipoma on the flank
of a dog is illustrated.
A pustule is a small circumscribed skin elevation
containing purulent material. This consists of
degenerate inflammatory cells (most commonly
neutrophils) with or without microorganisms or
other cells (e.g. acanthocytes in pemphigus
foliaceus). Pustules and vesicles rapidly rupture in
dogs and cats, leaving epidermal collarettes and 
crusts (see below).
A vesicle is a circumscribed elevation of the skin
up to I cm (0.4 in) in diameter filled with serum.
The illustrated vesicle occurred on this
veterinary nurse's arm within minutes of a flea
bite.A bulla is a vesicular lesion greater than I cm
(0.4 in) in diameter.
12 Introduction
A wheal is an irregular elevated edematous skin
area that often changes in size and shape. The
wheals in this case were acute,transient, and of
unknown etiology.
A cyst is an enclosed cavity with a membranous
lining that contains liquid or semi-solid matter.
The illustration is of a cystic basal cell tumor on
the head of a dog.
SECONDARY LESIONS
Secondary lesions are a result of trauma, time, and
degree ofinsult to the skin. Often, primary lesions
become pustules, which become focal encrusta-
tions, often hyperpigmented. Secondary lesions
are much less specific than primary lesions.
Comedones are the result of sebaceous and
epidermal debris blocking a follicle. They may
be seen in many diseases,but are often very
prominent in cases of hyperadrenocorticism,
as in this instance.
Introduction 13
Scale results from accumulations of superficial
epidermal cells that are dead and cast off from
the skin.ln this case there is an epidermal
collarette surrounding a postinflammatory patch
of hyperpigmentation. This presentation is 
frequently seen in cases of superficial pyoderma
and other pustular diseases.
Crust is composed of cells and dried exudates.
It may be serous, sanguineous, purulent, or mixed.
This cat has pemphigus foliaceus.
Erythema is reddening of the skin due to
increased blood flow (see under macules p.10).
The pattern of erythema may be diffuse to
generalized (e.g.atopic dermatitis) or
macular-papular (e.g pyoderma or
ectoparasites).In this Springer Spaniel the
erythema is due to Maiassezia pachydermatis
infection.
An erosion occurs following loss of the
superficial part of the epidermis (i.e.down to but
not including the basement membrane),as on the
face of this dog with discoid lupus
erythematosus.Erosions heal without scar
formation.
14Introduction
An ulcer is deeper than an erosion.They occur
following loss of the epidermis and basement
membrane and exposure of the deeper tissues of
the dermis. Lesions may scar, as in this decubital
ulcer overlying the bony prominence of the hip.
A sinus or fistula is a draining lesion.This dog
has panniculitis and there are draining fistulas on
the flank. The term sinus is usually reserved for
an epithelialized tract that connects a body cavity
and the skin surface.
An excoriation results from self-trauma.
In some cases, often in cats, the damage can be
extensive, as in this Persian cat with food allergy.
A scar results from the abnormal fibrous tissue
a burn as in this case.
Introduction 15
A fissure forms when thickened, usually
lichenified or heavily crusted, skin splits.
The illustration shows the foot of a dog with
necrolytic migratory erythema.
Lichenification occurs following chronic
inflammation, as in this case of M. pachydermatis
infection.There is thickening of the skin
associated with accentuation of normal skin
markings.Histopathologically, lichenification
consists of thickening of the epidermis
(acanthosis) and the stratum corneum
(hyperkeratosis).
Hyperpigmentation, an increase in cutaneous 
pigmentation, usually occurs after chronic
inflammation, as with this West Highland White
Terrier with atopic dermatitis.
Hyperpigmentation may also be seen in
cutaneous changes associated with an
endocrinopathy.
Hypopigmentation, a decrease in cutaneous
pigmentation, occasionally follows inflammation,
as in this case where it occurred after a
superficial pyoderma.It is more commonly
associated with immune-mediated inflammatory
dermatoses. Vitiligo,a rare non-inflammatory,
though possibly immune-mediated condition, is
characterized by symmetrical hypopigmentation.
There are also a number of hereditary conditions
associated with complete or partial loss of
pigmentation (e.g. albinism).

CHAPTER 1
Pruritic
dermatoses
General approach
● Rule out ectoparasites, particularly fleas
● Do not assume that the diagnosis is an allergy
● Remember that superficial pyoderma is pruritic
●Remember that immune-mediated diseases, keratinization disorders,
and many other dermatoses are occasionally pruritic
Diseases that may be refractory to steroid therapy
● Sarcoptic mange, Pelodera strongyloides dermatitis, and other
ectoparasites
● Malasszia dermatitis and pyoderma
● Allergic or irritant contact dermatitis
● Cutaneous adverse food reactions
● Epitheliotropic lymphoma
Diseases that may result in zoonoses
● Sarcoptic mange
● Cheyletiellosis
●Flea allergic dermatitis
● Syringomyelia
Common diseases
● Canine atopic dermatitis
● Cutaneous adverse food reactions (food or dietary allergy or intolerance)
● Flea bite hypersensitivity (flea allergy dermatitis)
● Sarcoptic mange (scabies, sarcoptic acariosis)

DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis is generally made on the clinical
appearance of lesions and a history of predis-
posing factors. Impression smears may be appro-
priate for determination of the number and type
of bacteria, and a skin biopsy would be appro-
priate if calcinosis cutis was suspected.
MANAGEMENT
Sedation may be necessary for initial treatment if
the lesions are painfil or the animal is fractious.
Any remaining hair should be clipped from
affected areas and the lesions cleaned with a
shampoo containing chlorhexidine or ethyl
lactate and thoroughly rinsed with clean water.
Other antimicrobial washes (see Superficial
pyoderma, p. 146) may be appropriate. The
lesion can then be treated with a drying solution
of 2% aluminum acetate (Domeboro solution)
for 3-5 minutes to decrease exudation. After
cleaning and drying, an antibiotic-steroid cream
or ointment can be applied. Application of the
drying solution and antibiotic-corticosteroid
preparation can be continued at home by the
owner 2-3 times a day. A novel, topical diester

is highly effective, with minimal adverse effects

as necessary, to reduce the inflammation and
shorten the time necessary for resolution of

corrected.

MANAGEMENT
Treatment of atopic dermatitis must be tailored

complications present in an individual animal.
Owners need to be aware that lifelong manage-
ment is the norm and it is not possible to predict
initially which animal will respond to a particular
therapy. They also need to understand that clin-
ical manifestations frequently change, resulting
in the need to adjust the therapy. Also, it is neces-
sary for the owner to appreciate the time and
financial commitment needed for the manage
ment of the atopic dog.

Cutaneous adverse food reaction 31
Cutaneous adverse food
reaction (food or dietary allergy or

intolerance)
ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
Cutaneous adverse food reaction (CAFR) is an
uncommon dermatosis caused by an abnormal
response to an ingested food or additive. The
 etiology of most cases of dietary intolerance is not
determined, but it may involve either food
intolerance or food hypersensitivity. Food intol-
erance is any clinically abnormal response to
the ingestion of a food that does not have an
immunologic component (e.g. food poisoning,
food idiosyncrasy, metabolic reactions, and
dietary indiscretions)]. Food hypersensitivity or
15
allergy is an abnormal response that is immuno-
logically mediated.
Most dogs tend to react to more that one
food; in one study of 25 dogs, the average was
2.42. Beef, chicken, dairy products, maize, wheat,
soy, and eggs all seem to be common allergens in
canine CAFRi-3. The range of allergens seems
similar in cats, although fewer cases have been
studied4,5.
The incidence of adverse reaction to food is
controversial and diffcult to determine, as it may
coexist with atopic dermatitis. About 10-15% of
all cases of allergic dermatosis are attributable to
adverse reactions to food' ,although the incidence
is higher in some reports-8. A range of IgE
binding proteins, including IgG and phospho-
glucomutase, have been identified in cattle and
sheep extracts?.
Up to 52% of dogs present at less than one
year of agel3, although there is no sex or breed
16
predisposition.
CLINICAL FEATURES
The clinical signs are usually very similar to those
of atopic dermatitis (14-l6). Pruritus is the most
prominent feature in the majority of cases; it is
usually non-seasonal, although dogs with a
seasonal exacerbation may have concurrent atopic
dermatitis orflea allergic dermatitis, orthere may

commonly reported.
Cats
Cats rarely manifest overt pruritus or primary
lesions. Feline FBH/FAD is a common cause of
a number of clinical presentations including
miliary dermatitis (a macular papular, crusting
dermatitis) (25), symmetrical self-induced
alopecia (26, 27), and lesions ofthe eosinophilic

In practice, negative allergen tests should not be
used to rule out FBH/FAD, particularly in cats.
Reports of positive tests to flea extracts vary from
 2% to 77%, which probably reflects the propor-
tion of atopic, flea allergic, and concurrent cases

salivary antigen67.
It can also be difficult to demonstrate fleas.
Flea feces are often the only sign of infestation
(30-32), but they may not be found in severely
pruritic overgrooming animals. It can be easier to
detect fleas and/or feces on clinically normal in-
contact animals. The presence of Dipylidium is
diagnostic and contagion is highly suggestive of
feas or other parasites. Lesions in humans are
small, pruritic, erythematous papular lesions,
typically on the lower limbs. Sensitized humans
may develop large bullous lesions, ulceration, and

Diagnosis is based on finding lice or nits on the
skin or hair. Lice are wingless, dorsoventrally flat-
tened insects with strong, gripping claws. Biting
lice have broad heads, whereas sucking lice have
narrow heads. Their eggs (nits') are large, oper-
culated, and cemented to the hair shaft.

ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
Sarcoptic mange is common in dogs but rare in
cats. Sarcoptes scabiei mites are highly contagious
through direct contact, fur, crusts, and fomites,
and they will infest a variety of species including
humansl (38), although different varieties are

DEFINITION
Hookworm dermatitis is a condition character-
ized by erythematous papular lesions that occur
following cutaneous penetration by the larvae of
hookworms.
ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
The dermatitis develops from the cutaneous
penetration ofthe third-stage larvae of Uncinari
stenocephala or Ancylostomα spp.located in
soil that the animal contacts'. Skin lesions are
more often associated with U. stenocephala
infestation than with Acylostomα spp. Larvae

DEFINITION
Intertrigo, or skin fold dermatitis, is an inflam-
matory condition occurring in skin that has
intimate contact with adjacent skin.
ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
Lip, facial, vulvar, body,and tail fold dermatitides
result from inflarmmation that occurs when skin is
closely opposed to skin. There is local abrasion,
inflammation, and an accumulation of surface
secretions, which result in maceration and
secondary infection.
CLINICAL FEATURES
Lip fold dermatitis (57) results from the overlap-
ping of redundant skin of the lower lip. The
redundant skin forms a crevice, which entraps
food particles and saliva, producing an ideal envi-

ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
Epidermal and follicular inclusion cysts are non-
neoplastic swellings with an epithelial liningl 2.
Epidermal inclusion cysts may result from the
traumatic implantation of keratinaceous material
of epidermal origin into the dermis. Folicular
inclusion cysts may result from traumatic occlu-
sion of the follicular canal, resulting in the accu-
mulation of pilosebaceous material. Both are
clinically indistinguisha ble from each other and
from benign epidermal or follicular tumors.

Basal cell carcinoma
80
(basal cell epithelioma)
DEFINITION
Basal cell carcinomas are uncommon, benign
 neoplasms that arise from the basal keratinocytes
of the epidermis. Previously these had been
included in the broad category of basal cell
tumors, which included similar appearing tumors
of adnexal structuresl.
ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
It is possible that basal cell tumors result from
neoplastic change within epidermal stem cells2.
The stimulus that results in a normally cycling cel
changing to a cell with neoplastic potential is not
known.
CLINICAL FEATURES
There is no sex predisposition. Most basal cell
tumors occur in older dogs and cats, typically on
the trunk of dogs and nose, face, and ears of catsl-4,
The incidence has been reported to be 1.25% of
skin tumors in cats and <0.3% in dogs56. The
 neoplasms appear as well-circumscribed indurated
plaques or umbilicated nodules. Overlying skin
may evidence alopecia, crusting, ulceration, and
a dark color due to melanin pigmentation (80).
Tumors tend to be smaller and occasionally
multicentric in the cat (8l). Metastasis has not
been reported in the dog and, although metas-
tasis has been reported in the cat, there are too
few cases to know the exact incidence?.

cases. Doxycycline ( 10 mg/kg p/o q24h) can be
usedin lieu oftetracycline. Once the lesions have
resolved (6-8 weeks) the interval of dosing can
be reduced to twice daily or once daily for mainte-
 nance,7. Ifthere is a poor response to tetracycline

generally resolve in 2-6 weeks. The dose can then
be changed to alternate day and, over 8-10
weeks, be tapered to maintenance. Azathioprine
(2 mg/kg P/o q24h or q48h) may be used along
with glucocorticoids in refractory cases?. Azathio-
prine therapy may also allow for a lower dose of
glucocorticoids and, when lesions have resolved,
should be dosed on alternate days to minimize
side-effects. Azathioprine may result in bone
 marrow suppression and this should be moni-
tored by performing complete blood counts bi-
weekly for the first eight weeks of therapy and
then quarterly. One author (TJN) has had very
good results using ciclosporin (cyclosporine)

 suggests there are as yet unknown genetic factors.
CLINICAL FEATURES
Cutaneous histiocytosis
Cutaneous histiocytosis is typically associated
with one or more nodules or plaques, especially
around the head, neck,perineum and perigenital
skin, and extremities (85, 86). They can be haired
or alopecic and erythematous, but are usually
non-painful and non-pruritic. More advanced
lesions may undergo central necrosis and scaring.
There is no apparent age (range 3-9 years),
breed, or sex predisposition'. Spontaneous remis-
sion may occur, but most cases tend to become
86
slowly progressive.
Systemic histiocytosis
Systemic histiocytosis is most commonly seen
in Bernese Mountain Dogs, but also in other
breedsincluding the Golden Retriever, Labrador
Retriever, Boxer, and Rottweiler. It usually affects
adults (47 years), but there is no sex predisposi-
tion. Skin lesions are similar to those of cutaneous
histiocytosis (see above), but there is also involve-
ment of the conjunctiva, sclera, retrobulbar
tissues, nasal cavity, lymph nodes, and internal
organs including the liver, spleen, lungs, and
bone marrow (87).

pododermatitis of cats
130
DEFINITION
Plasma cell pododermatitis is a rare disorder of
cats associated with plasma cell infiltration into
 one or more footpads1.
ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
The cause of the disease is not known, although
the presence of elevated serum globulin concen-
trations, lymphocytosis, plasma cell involvement,
and dermoepidermal immune complex deposi-
tion suggests an immune-mediated disorder2,3.
The gradual accumulation of plasma cells and
granulation tissue results in soft, poorly defined
swelling of the affected pad. Ulceration and
secondary infection of the protruding tissue
usually follow.
CLINICAL FEATURES
There is no breed, age, or sex predisposition.
Usually only a single pad is affected, typically the
central metacarpal or metatarsal pad’. Occa-
sionally, a digital pad or several pads may be
affectedl,2. Initially, there is a soft, painless

CLINICAL FEATURES
Vasculopathy of Greyhounds is observed
predominantly in young adult racing Grey-
hounds that are often fed a raw meat diet.
However, it has also been reported in a Great
Dane?. The majority of lesions occur on the
hindlimbs, but they can occasionally be seen on
the forelimbs, trunk, and inguinal region'.
Edema of the skin is the initial finding, which is
followed by erythemal. The erythematous skin
darkens and becomes black as it becomes
necrotic. Sloughing of the skin results in deep
ulcers that range from 1-5 cm (0.4-2.0 in) in
diameter'. Renal involvement can vary in severity,
as well as concomitant clinical signs of lethargy,

DEFINITION
 Nocardiosisis a pyogranulomatous infection due

ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
 Nocardia spp. are saprophytic aerobic bacteria
that enter the body through soil contamination
of wounds, inhalation, or ingestionl.2. Plant awns
may also serve as a means of introducing the
organism into tissues. Immunosuppression may
predispose animals to infection. Species isolated
from lesions of dogs and cats include N. asteroides,

which results in collagen that is in the form of

seen this syndrome in a Staffordshire Bull Terrier

most characteristic clinical findings (157).

of the clinical signs is achieved with inmuno-

once remission is achieved the dose should be

A detemined search for an underlying disease

crust and scale
General approach
● Crust and scale are common, but are secondary and often non-
specific lesions
● Crusts are dried exudates; scales are accumulated keratinocytes
● Carefully evaluate the history and clinical signs to narrow the
dlifferential diagnosis
● It is helpful to initially consider groups of differential diagnoses
before focusing on individual conditions (e.g. ectoparasites;
hypersensitivity; infections; endocrine, metabolic, or nutritional;
immune-mediated; congenital or hereditary; miscellaneous)
Common conditions
● Callus formation
●Actinic dermatosis
●Feline acne
●Sebaceous adenitis

ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
Vitamin A responsive dermatosis is a rare
dermatosis characterized by epidermal hyper-
keratosis with markedly disproportionate follicu-
lar hyperkeratosis. The etiology is not known.
Retinoic acid is esential for a wide range of
cell and tissue functions, but its cutaneous role
is particularly directed towards keratinocyte
proliferation and differentiation by regulating
the expression of keratinsl.2. Even though the

CLINICAL FEATURES
Lesions are first noticed in animals when they are
between five and eight months ofage and initially
consist of scaling and thinning of the hair over the
face, ears, and back (215, 216). The condition
 often becomes generalized and lesions may be
most prominent on the muzzle, pinnae, hocks,
scrotum, and pressure points2,3. Affected skin has

surrounding hair shafs. Scale builds up,resulting
in crusts. Secondary bacterial and Malasseziα
infections can occur. Papules, pustules, and
erythema ofthe axillae, scrotum, and interdigital
areas and erythema on the concave aspect of the
pinna have been reported in a small number
of cases3. Pruritus is generally minimal and

commonly, there is a relative deficiency due to
interaction with other dietary components or
an inability to utilize dietary zinc. Absorption
of zinc from the gut is inhibited by iron,
copper, and calcium, which compete with zinc
for absorptionl.2. Intestinal phytate and inor-
ganic phosphate bind zinc and hinder absorp-
tion. This is most likely to be seen in rapidly
growing animals, particularly giant breeds, fed
inadequate diets or diets in which nutritional
antagonism occurs, particularly due to high

calcium.

Spiculosis
28
DEFINITION
Spiculosis is a rare condition of Kerry Blue
Terriers, characterized by pruritus and hard brittle
 spicules protruding from hair folicles.
ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
The pathogenesis of spiculosis is unknown. It is
possible that the condition is congenital, with six
months to one year needed for expression of
the clinical disease. Cells of the hair bulb show
premature keratinization that results in an
amorphous keratinized mass, which is shaped by
the outer root sheath and follicular wall into a
spicule'.
CLINICAL FEATURES

Blue Terriers. It is characterized by hard brittle
spicules that are l.0-2.5 mm in diameter and
0.5-3.0 cm in length (228, 229). In the
229
reported cases, onset oflesions occurred sponta-
neously at between six months and one year of
 age'. Lesions may be found on any haired area of
the body, but they are found most frequently over
the lateral aspect of the hocks. Affected animals
may be asymptomatic or may lick and chew exces-
sively at the involved areas. Licking or chewing of
affected areas can be excessive to the point that
the animals develop acral lick granulomasl.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSES
Spiculosis is highly distinctive clinically. The only
time confusion could arise is if secondary acral lick
granulomas are present.

Myiasis
245
DEFINITION
Myiasis is infestation by fly larvae that feed on
necrotic or living tissue ofthe host.
ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
 Lesions are generally associated with larvae of flies
that produce facultative myiasis in contaminated
skin wounds. Typically, they are from the genera
Musca,Callipbora,Phaenicia,Lncilia,Phormia
and Sarcophagα?. They go through four develop-
mental stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. For
facultative myiasis to develop in a warm- blooded
animal, there must be a factor such as traumatized
skin, ocular discharge, neglected wound, or
fecal soiling to attract the female fly to deposit
eggs. Primary flies (Lucilia,Phormia, and some
Calliphora) lay eggs in such sites; their larval
stages can move independently over the surface
of a wound, ingesting secretions, exudate, dead
cells, and debris, but not live tissue. However,
they can induce irritation, injure cells, and
provoke exudation. Secondary flies (Calliphora,

DIAGNOSIS
Breed association and clinical site will allow
recognition of fold dermatitis. Microscopic
examination of skin scrapes and tape strips will
demonstrate ectoparasites, yeasts, and bactenia.
Care should be taken to rule out systemic disease,
as not all cases are entirely anatomic.
MANAGEMENT
The management of these diseases is directed
towards attending to the underlying cause ofthe

changes, necessary debridement should be
performed and old medications along with any
exudate are removed by irrigation with saline or
immersion in a whirlpool bath.

Frostbite 229
Frostbite
250
DEFINITION
Frostbite is tissue damage that results from
freezing.
ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
Frostbite occurs with prolonged exposure to
freezing temperatures and is more likely to occur
if the animal is also exposed to windy conditions
or if there is wetting of a body area. The patho-
genesis involves direct cold injury to the cell, indi-
rect cold injury by formation of ice crystals, and
impaired circulation with hypoxia.
CLINICAL FEATURES
250 Frostbite.Note the pallor of the feet.
Lesions typically occur in areas where the hair
coat is sparse. In cats the tips of the ears, the tail,
and the footpads are most commonly affected,
while in dogs it is more often the scrotum and
footpads (250). Cats with mild frostbite may be

being a delayed lightening of hair color on the

258
ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
Hyperadrenocorticism (HAC or Cushing's
disease) results from prolonged exposure to
elevated serum cortisol concentrations, which
may be spontaneous or iatrogenic. Most cases
(80-85%) of spontaneous HAC in dogs are pitu-
itary dependent (PDH): functional adenomas
of the anterior pituitary secrete adrenocorti-
cotropic hormone (ACTH), resulting in adreno-
 cortical hyperplasia. Fifteen to twenty per cent of

Disorders of the nails
DEFINITION
Claw abnormalities are defined by certain terms.
The following is a partial list of these terms and
includes those that are used more frequently in
association with conditions of the dog and catl:
+
Macronychia: unusually large claws.
 Onychalgia: claw pain.
+Onychia (onchitis): inflammation
somewhere in the claw unit.
+
Onychoclasis: breaking of claws.
Onychocryptosis (onyxis): ingrown claws.
291
Onychodystrophy: abnormal claw
formation.
 Onychogryphosis: hypertrophy and
abnormal curvature of claws.
Onychomadesis: sloughing of claws (290).
 Onychomalacia: softening of claws.
Onychomycosis: fungal infection of claws.
+
 Onychorrhexis: longitudinal striations
 associated with brittleness and breaking of
claws.
● Onychoschizia: splitting and/or lamination
of claws, usually beginning distally.
 Onychopathy: disease abnormality of claws.
 Paronychia: inflammation/infection of claw
folds (291, 292).
ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
Onycopathy may occur due to trauma, bacterial
infection, neoplasia, dermatophytosis, pemphigus
292
foliaceus, lupus erythematosus, other autoim-
mune diseases, deep mycotic infections, leishma-
niasis, severe generalized systemic disease, severe
nutritional deficiencies, and idiopathic changes]-4.
CLINICAL FEATURES
Trauma
Trauma is the most common cause of damage
to the claws of dogs and cats. This often occurs
when a long claw is caught in a carpet or rug,
resulting in avulsion of the claw plate. Damage
can also occur with bite wounds or when a foot is
run over by a motor vehicle or is stepped on.
It may also occur in hunting dogs and racing
Greyhounds due to the severe strain that is placed
on the claws while the dogs are working.
Onychalgia, onychoclasis, onychomadesis, and,
occasionally, onychorrhexis are noted. Secondary

Dermatophytosis
ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
Dermatophytosis is an infection ofthe skin, hair,
or nails with fungi of the Microsporum, Tricho-
phyton,or Epidermopbyton genus.The most
common cause in cats is M. conis; in dogs
the most common causes are M. comis and
M. gysew. Other less frequent species include
T.mentagrophytes,M.persicotor,T.erinacei,
M.verucosum,M.eguinwm,and T.equinwm.
Isolation rates from healthy cats vary and
probably reflect differences in environment and
management. Dermatophytes are most likely to
be isolated from colonies of cats, but they are
exposed to infection. It is possible that culture-
301
 positive cats are transiently contaminated rather
than true carriers5-8.
Infection is by contact with infected animals
or contaminated environments and the incuba-
tion period varies from l-3 weeks. Dermato-
phytes infect growing hairs and living skin.
Factors that influence the outcome of infection
include a young age or the elderly, immunosup-
pression, high temperature and humidity, and
skin trauma. M. canis is more common in Persian
cats and Yorkshire Terriers (possibly due to inef-
fective grooming and/orimpaired cell-mediated
immunity) and Jack Russell Terriers are predis-
(possibly because of their behavior)2-4. Most cats
inoculated with spores do not develop dermato-
phytosis, as their grooming behavior efficiently
302
removes the spores9.
M. canis tends to induce a mild, self-limiting
infection and a low-grade immune response.
Antibodies are not protective and recovery is
associated with cell-mediated immunity, which is
nevertheless short-lived and induces relative and
not absolute resistance?,0. Lesions typically
resolve in 2-3 months, although animals may
remain infective for several weeks longer. Infec-
tive fungal spores are readily shed into the envi-
ronment and can remain viable for 1 8 monthsll.
Control of contamination is of great importance
in the management of dermatophytosis.

Canine familial
dermatomyositis
DEFINITION
Canine familial dermatomyositis is an hereditary
inflammatory disease of skin and muscle that is
characterized by symmetrical scarring alopecia
about the face and limbs and atrophy of the
muscles of mastication'.
ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
The etiopathogenesis of canine familial dermato-
myositis is unknown. It is postulated that
immunologic damage occurs to blood vessels,
resulting in ischemic damage to the skin and
muscles?. The condition is familial in Collies and
Shetland Sheepdogs and breeding studies in
Collies support an autosomal dominant mode of
inheritance with variable expressivity3,4.
CLINICAL FEATURES
313
The disease occurs more commonly in Collies
and Shetland Sheepdogs, but it has also been
reported to occur in the Welsh Corgi, Chow
Chow, German Shepherd Dog, and Kuvasz, and 
may sporadically occur in other breeds. Lesions
generally develop before animals are six months
of age, but they can occasionally develop in
adults. The typical distribution pattern for lesions
is the face (especially the bridge of the nose,
around the eyes, and the tips of the ears [312]],
carpal and tarsal areas (313), digits, and tip ofthe
tail. A scarring alopecia, erythema, scaling, and
mild crusting are the most common findings.
Occasionally, vesicles, papules, pustules, and
ulcers may be found3. The rate of development 
and progression of lesions is quite variable, as they
often wax and wane and may undergo sponta-
neous regression. Muscle involvement occurs
after the development of skin lesions and corre-
lates with the severity of the skin lesions?. It is

Follicular dysplasia
316
DEFINITION
Non-color-linked follicular dysplasia is a rare,
tardive disorder in which abnormal follicular
function results in either a patchy loss of hair or
generalized abnormality of hair structure.
ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
The disorder is of unknown etiology, although
the fact that individuals of certain breeds appear
to exhibit similar signs suggests an inherited
component. The abnormalities in follicle function
result in failure to cycle properly, pigment
clumping, shaft abnormalities, hypotrichosis or
alopecia, and follicular hyperkeratosis?.
CLINICAL FEATURES
Although any individual animal may be affected,
a number of syndromes have been recognized in

but it can occur in other short-coated breeds such
as the Boston Terrier, Chihuahua, Greyhound,
Whippet, and Miniature Pinscher. Common
features of pattern alopecia include an insidious
onset and slowly progressive, symmetrical,
and focal hair loss, which may result in well-
demarcated patches of complete alopecia. The
underlying skin is usually normal. Very short and
very fine hairs may be evident, especially in the
earlier stages. Affected dogs show no systemic
clinical signs, and the rest of the hair coat is
 normal. One pattern involves gradual alopecia
and hyperpigmentation of the pinnae in male
and, less commonly, female Dachshunds. This
usually starts at 6-l2 months of age and is
complete by 6-9 years of age. Another pattern is
seen in young to adult Greyhounds that develop
gradual hair loss of the caudal thighs. The most
frequently seen pattern consists of a bilateral thin-
ning of hair that can progress to total hair loss in
one or more of the following areas: pinna and
areas just caudal to the pinna, areas between ear
and eye, ventral neck, chest, ventral abdomen,
perianal, and caudal thighs. Ofthese the pinna is
most frequently affected. This pattern occurs in
Dachshunds, but it is also recognized in other
breeds.
