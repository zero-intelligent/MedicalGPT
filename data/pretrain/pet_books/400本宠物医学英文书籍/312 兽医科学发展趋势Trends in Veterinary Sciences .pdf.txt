Seasonal Effect on Hematological
and Innate Immune Parameters in Sea
Bass (Dicentrarchus labrax)
Francesco Pascoli, E. Negrato, C. Poltronieri, G. Radaelli
and D. Bertotto
Abstract The temperate aquatic environment is affected by two primary seasonal
components, temperature and photoperiod. Many organisms respond to seasonal
change physiologically, behaviorally or both. The aim of this study was to
investigate the effect of seasonality on cortisol, hematological, and innate immune
parameters in European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) reared under traditional
semi-intensive aquaculture. Sea bass were reared in an outdoor pond.
Serum cortisol, hematocrit, leucocrit, serum lysozyme activity, and total
glutathione (GSH) were monitored bimonthly for 14 months. An effect of sea-
sonality was observed for all parameters, with generally higher values in summer
and lower values in winter. These results could improve the understanding of the
infuence of seasonal cues on the immune system and the stress response in fish, to
optimize husbandry practices.

1.1 Introduction
In the literature, there are numerous studies on the infuence of seasonality on fish
physiology. The temperate aquatic enviromment is infuenced throughout the year
by two main seasonal cues, temperature and photoperiod (Morgan et al. 2008)
In fish, seasonality coordinates reproduction, affects body weight and

physiological status, regulates food intake and locomotion, and is thought also to
coordinate the immune response (Bowden et al. 2007). In general, physiological
parameters are reduced in winter and raised in summer (Bowden et al. 2007).
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of seasonality on
growth, cortisol, immunological, and hematological parameters in sea bass reared
1.2 Materials and Methods
Juvenile sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) were reared in an outdoor tank from May
2009 to July 2010 and monitored every 2 months (initial weight 69 g; final weight
350 g; stocking density 2-12 kg/m?). At each sampling, 20 animals were caught
and measured (total and standard length and weight) to observe growth and
condition factor (K). Blood samples were collected from the caudal vein.
Serum cortisol analysis was carried out by radioimmunoassay (RIA), as described
by Simontacchi et al. (2008). Hematocrit and leucocrit were obtained by micro-
centrifugation of whole blood (12,500 rpm for 5 min). Serum lysozyme activity
was measured by a turbidimetric assay, as described by Parry et al. (1965).
Total glutathione (GSH) was determined by an enzymatic assay adapted to
microtiter plate (Baker et al., 1990).
1.3 Results
Weight increased from 69.1 ± 3.0 g to 345.5 ± 13.6 g after 14 months.
During this period, the condition factor worsened from 1.02 ± 0.03 to
1.21 ± 0.01, with the lowest values in December 2009, January 2010, and March
2010 (0.94 ± 0.02, 0.94 ± 0.02, and 0.95 ± 0.02, respectively) and a significant

Serum cortisol was significantly higher in May 2009, May 2010, and July 2010
compared to the other months (p <0.05; Fig. 1.1). The lowest levels were
recorded in October and December 2009, and January and March 2010 (p < 0.05).
The hematocrit was significantly lower in January and March 2010 than the
other samples (p < 0.05; Fig. 1.2). The leucocrit was significantly lower in
December 2009, January 2010, and March 2010 compared to the other months
(p < 0.05; Fig. 1.3). The highest value was recorded in October (p < 0.01).
Serum lysozyme activity increased from May to October 2009, then decreased
until January 20l0 and increased again after that point (Fig. 1.4). The lowest values
were recorded in January (p < 0.01). Higher values were found in July 2010 than in
May, July, and December 2009 and March 2010, but these were not significantly
different from those in October 2009 and May 2010.

1.4 Discussion
In this study, we investigated the effect of seasonality on some hematological and
stress parameters in sea bass reared under conventional semi-intensive aquaculture.
The effect of seasonality was observed for all parameters investigated. The growth
and condition factors showed a significant reduction during the coldest months
(October to March), due to a lower water temperature, which affects food intake,
and consequently diet and metabolism (Pastoureaud 1991).
Serum cortisol levels showed a seasonal patterm, with lower values during the
coldest months and higher values in the wanmer months, consistent with the
fuctuations of temperature and photoperiod as already reported by Planas et al.
(1990).
The lowest hematocrit values were recorded in January and March, in corre-
lation with the lowest temperatures, which increase the solubility of oxygen in the
water and reduce metabolism, requiring a lower number of red blood cells to carry
oxygen around the body (Stolen et al. 1984). The highest leucocrit values were
recorded in October 2009, whereas the lowest were during the winter months.
Seasonal changes in hematological and immunological parameters have been
found in other species. It is hypothesized that shorter daylight hours can induce
changes in the immune system to prepare for winter. In our study, the highest
WBC values, found in October, may also be related to a viral encephalitis that
occurred in August 2010 and that has caused the death of 8.31 % of the fish.
F. Pascoli et al.
Serum lysozyme activity showed a seasonal trend related to temperature and
photoperiod, with lower values during the colder months, consistent with other
studies in the literature.
The observed levels of GSH suggest a relationship with seasonality, as reported
in previous studies. In mammals, fasting and infammatory processes can affect the
levels of GSH, causing a decrease in plasma levels (Malmezat et al. 2000).
Consequently, the low levels found in this study during the colder months may be
related to winter starvation and to the viral encephalitis that occurred in August
and September.
In conclusion, all parameters exhibited a seasonal patterm, similar to studies
performed in other species. These results may contribute to a better understanding
of the mechanisms that regulate the influence of seasonal components on the
immune and stress responses in fish, leading to optimized husbandry practices.

Effect of Altitude on Plasma Serotonin
Levels in Horses
G. Bruschetta, P. Di Pietro, M. Miano, C. Cravana
and A.M.Ferlazzo
Abstract The aim of this work was to carry out a preliminary study about the
effect of altitude on plasma serotonin (5-HT) and tryptophan levels in horses.
Subjects came from a riding school at sea level and 600 m above sea level.
To evaluate animal welfare linked to physiological status, cortisol levels, blood
cell count and hematochemical variables (glucose, total proteins, albumin, creat-
inine, urea, aspartate transaminase, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, tri-
glycerides and total cholesterol) were measured. Comparison of mean plasma
levels of 5-HT, tryptophan, and cortisol in horses coming from different altitudes
were not significantly different. Plasma 5-HT levels were affected by altitude in a
'sia pue sae uaamaq puan susoddo ue sumous em juapuadap-iapuas
with the highest levels in plasma of geldings coming from farms at sea level. Both
5-HT and tryptophan were higher in mares than in geldings from 600 m above sea
level. Plasma cortisol levels, which were significantly higher in mares than in
geldings at sea level, were more affected by gender than altitude.

2.1Introduction
Serotonin, or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), is a neurotransmitter produced
independently in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues from two
distinct isoforms of the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH-1 and TPH-2),
which catalyses the rate limiting step of the synthesis process. Its many biological
functions include pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation, smooth
muscle bronchial vasoconstriction and local microthrombosis (MacLean et al.
2000). Indeed, high circulating 5-HT levels were associated with the onset of
          
were increased in hypoxic conditions, even in mice (Callebert et al. 2006). 5-HT is
synthesised from the amino acid tryptophan (Try) in the brain, in mast cells and in
intestinal enterochromaffin cells, where the gene of the classic isoenzyme TPH-1,
which controls the peripheral 5-HT production, is mostly expressed (Walther and
Bader 2003). Both TPH-1 and peripheral 5-HT play an essential role in the
development of hypoxia-induced increased pulmonary pressure and pulmonary
vascular remodelling (Morecroft et al. 2007). Platelets do not synthesise 5-HT, but
they are its major site of storage and transport in the peripheral blood (Andres et al.
1993). The 5-HT uptake within them keeps plasma 5-HT concentrations low.
and Elliott 1998; Di Pietro et al. 2010; Lebelt et al. 1998), and often an increase of
circulating 5-HT is linked to common pathological conditions such as laminitis
(Bailey et al. 2009). Considering the clinical importance of this variable, the aim
of this study was to evaluate, in horses of different breeds, the effect of horse
farm altitude on plasma levels of 5-HT and Try, its precursor amino acid.
Moreover, some haematochemical and hormonal parameters were detenmined to
signal the animal welfare status and/or the presence of any stress conditions.
2.2 Materials and Methods
Twenty clinically healthy horses (9 geldings and 11 mares) of various breeds (San
Fratellana, Sella Italiana and crossbred) were used. Mean age was 10 ± 6 years.
Horses came from fanms and riding schools in Messina, Catania and their
nearby environs at sea level or at an altitude of 600 m above sea level (asl).
All horses housed in Messina, in individual boxes, were fed with fresh forages,
concentrates and water. Blood samples were collected from the jugular vein into
EDTA tubes at 8:30 a.m., at approximately 25 °C, in the month of May. Blood cell
count was performed, and after centrifugation at 2,000 g, the following haemato-
chemical parameters were detected: glucose (Glu), total proteins (TP), albumin
(ALB), creatinine (Crea), urea, aspartate transaminase (AST), creatine kinase
(CPK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TCho),
by spectrophotometry and serum cortisol levels (in duplicate, by ELISA kit [Radim,
2 Effect of Altitude on Plasma Serotonin Levels in Horses

Pomezia, Italy]). The platelet poor plasma (PPP) fraction was obtained by
centrifugation at 4,500 g. Equal volumes of plasma, N-methylserotonin (intermal
standard) and protein precipitation reagent were vigorously vortex mixed, incubated
at 4 °C and centrifuged at 4,500 g. The obtained supermatant was used for
the detection of plasma serotonin and tryptophan by reverse phase HPLC (Waters
1 ,525 binary HPLC pump) with electrochemical detector (ESA). Statistical analysis
was done by Student's unpaired t test and Pearson's correlation and linear
regression tests.
2.3 Results
The blood cell count and haematochemical parameters were in the physiological
            
state of wellness. Preliminary data (Table 2.1) did not show any sigmificant
differences of plasma 5-HT, tryptophan and cortisol levels with altitude change,
nor significant correlations among them. However, a difference in plasma 5-HT
levels based on altitude was observed when the horses were divided by gender
(Table 2.2). Plasma tryptophan levels (Table 2.2) were similar in mares and
geldings at sea level, but slightly higher in mares at 600 m asl, with a trend
comparable to 5-HT. In mares, higher concentrations of cortisol were observed in
both groups (Table 2.2), which were significant at sea level and at 600 m asl.
2.4 Discussion
Mares seem to respond to higher altitude with greater 5-HT values compared to
those housed at sea level (Table 2.2), consistent with observations in cows
(Bruschetta et al. 2010) and rats (Awabdy et al. 2003). At higher altitude, platelet
function could be downregulated, producing a decrease of platelet serotonin
uptake and increased circulating serotonin levels. On the contrary, in geldings, there
was a significant increase in 5-HT at sea level. Moreover, a gender-dependent effect
on plasma 5-HT levels was detected in horses at sea level, which was slight in
horses at 600 m asl. An analysis using a larger sample size could support these
results and clarify the existence of an interaction among different variables that may
have opposite effects on plasma 5-HT levels. Further, significant findings could
come from the comparison of horses coming from farms or riding schools at sea
level with horses farmed at altitudes higher than 1,000 m asl.

The major changes in tryptophan values were observed in mares. These data
could suggest the existence of sexual dimorphism, which could be deeper investi-
gated using a greater number of horses. The higher concentration of cortisol
observed in mares in both groups (Table 2.2) confirms the existence of a regulation
of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis of horses in a gender-dependent
manner, as already observed in humans (Stroud et al. 2011) and rats (Viau et al.
2005). With a larger sample size, this could be of interest for geldings fanmed at
600 m asl.

Identification of Aquaporin 1 in Diplodus
sargus
G. Zanghi, S. Campo, A. D'Ascola, A. Germana and A. M. Ferlazzo
Abstract Aquaporin 1 (AQP-1) is the frst member of the aquaporin family, which
includes seven homologs in teleosts, involved in the selective transport of water,
small neutral molecules, and ions. AQPs contain six transmembrane helices, five
connecting loops, and the amino and carboxyl ends protrude into the cytoplasm.
AQPs are important for osmoregulation in fish gills (independent of salinity),
kidneys, and intestine. Here, the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of AQP-1 in
Diplodus sargus were characterized, and a phylogenetic tree was built to study its
evolution. Results showed that AQP-1 mRNA is 1,325 nucleotides in length, and
the deduced protein contains two canonical Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA) consensus motifs
and all features for water transport. D. sargus AQP-1 is located in a homophyletic
branch with Sparus aurata only, inside of a sub-tree in a paraphyletic position with
Centropristis striata and Osmerus mordax. Although the structure of the AQP
protein in different species is conserved, results showed that the S. aurata and
D. sargus AQP-1 proteins have evolved similarly.

3.1 Introduction
The survival of fish in the water environment is strictly associated with the correct
functional properties of some critical structures,such as ionic channels,which play
key roles in electrochemical and osmotic equilibria. Aquaporins (AQPs) facilitate
the very fast fux of water molecules to the inside and outside of cells of specific
tissues (e.g., proximal tubules, erythrocytes, and membranes of vegetal cell
vacuoles). Their presence is necessary for transport of water, which, as a polar
molecule, negligibly diffuses through biological membranes. Currently. 13 iso-
forms of AQPs have been identified in mammals, variously distributed to various
organs (Ablimit et al. 2006; Lee et al. 1997; Lopez et al. 2007), and 17 AQPs have
been identified in both fresh and marine teleosts (Cerda and Finn 2010), particularly
 in pufferfish and zebrafish (Tingaud-Sequeira et al. 2010). The duplicate isoforms
of aquaporin 1 (AQP-1) are involved in intestinal water absorption in marine fish
(Tingaud-Sequeira et al. 2008). AQPs comprise a superfamily of intrinsic proteins,
with a molecular weight between 36 and 78 kDa, located inside the membrane lipid
bilayer, allowing the bidirectional transport of water (Agre 2006). Two families of
AQPs were identified (Gonen and Walz 2006): specific aguaporins, allowing only
transport of water, and aquaglyceroporins, allowing transport of water, glycerol,
and other neutral molecules (Agre et al. 2002; Litman et al. 2009). Both proteins
contain transmembrane domains that cross the phospholipid layer (Fu and Lu
2007). AQPs are ethero- and homotetramers. Every protein subunit contains its own
one of six transmembrane domains that cross the lipid bilayer and faces each other:
the first three domains (a, b, c) oppose the other three (al, b1, cl). In the channel
pore, the N- and C-terminal ends of the polypeptide chains are oriented toward the
intracellular environment. Moreover, the AQP structure contains extracellular
loops (A, C, E) and intracellular loops (B, D, F) (Jung et al. 1994). The aqueous
channel pore is formed by loops B and E, folded to create the central pore.
The loops contain particular Asn-pro-ala (NPA) motifs, allowing an “hourglass"
structure (Agre et al. 1999). AQP-1 is the first member of the AQP family, which
includes seven homologous proteins in teleosts, that is particularly important in
some osmoregulatory fish organs, especially gills, where it is expressed in great
amounts, in addition to the kidney and gut (Giffard-Mena et al. 2007).
Among marine teleosts of the perciform family, Diplodus sargus (Bargelloni et al.
2005) is found in the Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea, and Easterm Atlantic Ocean.
Young specimens live on the surface, and lonely adults live on rocky seabeds at
depths of 20-30 m and are 35-45 cm in length. D. sargus reproduces at the
beginning of autumn, and its fries remain for some time in brackish waters, then
adapt to the changing water salinity. In order to understand the molecular mech-
anisms allowing this species to adapt in an extremely good way to different envi-
ronmental conditions, the aim of this study was to characterize AQP-1 nucleotide

and amino acid sequences by constructing a phylogenetic tree to evaluate its
evolution. The molecular study of this perciform family fish is very interesting.
from both a scientific point of view and its commercial consequences.
3.2 Materials and Methods
The research was carried out on 10 specimens of D. sargus, 250 g body weight.
farmed for 10 days under normal salinity conditions in an aquarium containing 300 L
fresh seawater and gassed with an integrated air pump oxygenator. After anesthesia
with MS-222 (40 mg/L ethyl-m-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate), fish were sac-
rificed for gill sampling (50-100 mg). After homogenization and total mRNA
extraction using the Trizol Reagent kit (Invitrogen, USA) followed by RT-PCR, the
AQP-1 nucleotide sequence was identified using the rapid amplification of cDNA
ends (RACE) technique. To build the phylogenetic tree, AQP-1 was aligned using
ClustalW software with AQPs 1 and 3 of 33 temperate and Antarctic teleosts,
a Renibacterium, and other higher vertebrates, representing the outgroup. The tree
was calculated by the Neighbor-Joining method with a 1,000 repetitions Bootstrap
using the MEGA 5.05 program, whereas the calculus matrix was experimentally
evaluated using ProTest software. Phylogenetic trees were drawn to scale, whereas
evolutionary distances were calculated using the Poisson correction method
The phylogenetic tree, so drawn, showed a good resolution, given that only one knot
had a value lower than 0.5.
3.3Results
In Fig. 3.1, the nucleotide sequence of D. sargus AQP-1 is reported. The mRNA is
1,325 nucleotides in length; its start codon is located at position 116, the stop codon
is located at position 901, and the polyadenylation signals are located at positions
957 and 1,303. In Fig. 3.2, the amino acid sequence of the deduced protein, which is
261 amino acid residues in length and highly homologous to those of other studied
fish species is shown. The protein contains two particular NPA motifs and all
essential features for water transport. The two NPA domains can be observed at
positions 70 and 184, and contain loops B and E, respectively. In addition, it is
possible to see amino acid residues of the other four loops. The phylogenetic tree
can be divided into four main sub-trees. The frst contains AQPs of outgroup
species (chicken, Xenopus, and human). Reptile AQP, Vitis vinifer, lies on a distinct
branch. On the first sub-tree, in an unusual way, AQPs of two teleosts are included.
The fourth sub-tree contains the majority of AQP-3, while the third sub-tree
contains the AQP-1 of some teleosts and human AQP-2. Finally, AQP-1 of almost
all analyzed teleosts is included in the second sub-tree, which contains different
clusters, one formed only from the D. sargus and Sparus aurata AQPs that

obviously are monophyletic, but are in a paraphyletic position with AQP-l of
Centropristis striata and Osmerus mordax. The length of the branches of this
cluster also shows that D. sargus and S. aurata AQPs have undergone a very recent
andcommon diversification.
3.4 Discussion
        r   
The drawn phylogenetic tree shows that the evolutionary diversification of this
gene is similar to that of S.aurata.This study willbe strengthened by the
characterization and identification of AQP-3 in the same species; AQP-3, in which
two duplicated genetic isofonms have been found in zebrafish (Danio rerio), plays
tean organs (Cutler et al. 2007).

Effect of Dephosphorylation on Donkey
Milk Caseins
S. Vincenzetti, A. Vita, F. M. Carpi, D. Micozzi and P. Polidori
Abstract Donkey  milk  caseins   display great microheterogeneity  by
two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE), probably because of a variable degree of
phosphorylation and/or altemative splicing phenomena. In this work, we have
investigated the complexity of the donkey milk caseins: The whole casein fraction
was subjected to treatment with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase to achieve
dephosphorylation. The obtained apo forms were analyzed by 2-DE and compared
with whole donkey caseins. As a result, donkey milk β-casein and its splicing
variants are present as different phosphorylated isofonms, whereas αsi-casein
displays severalisoforms that are derived from both phosphorylation and
glycosylation phenomena.

β-caseins show several polymorphic patterms due to altemative splicing phe-
nomena; furthenmore,there are some other isofonms of caseins due to post-
translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation (Miclo et al.
2007). The phosphate group of casein may affect many of its features, such as their
digestion and the bioavailability of divalent cations. It is known that in cow's milk
protein allergy, caseins are the proteins widely responsible for this allergic phe-
nomenon. In particular, some authors have shown that the αsi-casein in its
phosphorylated form plays an important role in the allergenicity of milk and that in
general, the αs- and β-caseins that possess serine-phosphorylated residues can be
considered immunoreactive and resistant to digestion (Tezcucano et al. 2007). In
this work, we investigated the complexity of donkey milk caseins patterm by two-
dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) analyses. For this purpose, the total caseins
obtained by isoelectric precipitation were dephosphorylated by alkaline phos-
phatase, showing that donkey's milk β-casein and its splice variants are largely
present as phosphorylated isoforms, while donkey's milk αsi-casein shows dif-
ferent isoforms that may result from both phosphorylation and glycosylation
phenomena.
4.2 Materials and Methods
Donkey's milk was collected from 10 Martina Franca breed asses at an interme-
diate stage of lactation. The milk was skimmed by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for
30 min, at a temperature of 15 *C. The casein fraction was obtained from skimmed
milk by acidic precipitation at pH 4.6 with 10 % acetic acid, followed by
   s d    n     
50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, and 8 M urea. The 2-DE was performed as
follows: 100 μg casein was treated with the 2D-Clean-Up kit (GE Healthcare) and
resuspended in rehydration buffer (8 M urea, 2 % CHAPS, 65 mM DTT, 0.001 %
bromophenol blue, and 0.5 % IPG buffer, pH 4-7). Isoelectric focusing was per-
formed on an immobilized gradient at pH 47 (Immobiline DryStrip gel, 18 cm,
GE Healthcare). The IPG strip was rehydrated for 12 h at 15 *C to avoid deam.
idation (at the level of a residue of Asn), which may occur when the isoelectric
focusing is carried out at temperatures above 20 °C (Matéos et al. 2009).
The electrophoretic conditions were 50 A/strip, 1 h at 500 V, 1 h at 1,000 V, and
4 h at 8,000 V. The second dimension consisted of 13 % SDS-PAGE.
After electrophoresis, proteins were stained using Coomassie blue or blotted to
polyvinylidene difuoride membranes to analyze each spot by N-tenminal
sequencing. Spot analysis was carried out using PDQuest software (Version 7.1.1 ;
Bio-Rad Laboratories) for spot-intensity calibration, as well as calculation of
phorylation, the casein fraction was resuspended in 10 ml 0.4 % ammonium
bicarbonate, pH 8.5, containing 0.5 mM MgCly. The solution was heated to 80 °C
for 5 min to disperse the caseins and then was lyophilized in 5.3-mg aliquots.

23
Lyophilized caseins were resuspended in 50 mM Tris/HCl, 10 mM MgClz, and
1 mM DTT, pH 7.5, and treated with alkaline phosphatase (20 units) for 3 h at
37 °C. After incubation, the dephosphorylated casein samples were frozen and
freeze-dried. Subsequently, dephosphorylated caseins were subjected to 2-DE as
described above. The control consisted of caseins treated in the same way as those
subjected to dephosphorylation but incubated in the absence of alkaline
phosphatase.
4.3 Results
Figure 4.1 shows the electrophoretic patterm of the phosphorylated casein fraction
(control, Fig. 4.1a) compared with dephosphorylated caseins (Fig. 4.1b). A shift of
dephosphorylated caseins toward more basic pH values with respect to the control
is evident, because of the removal of the negative charge of the phosphate groups.
The phosphorylated and dephosphorylated caseins were analyzed by PDQuest
software and N-tenminal sequencing, and the results are summarized in Table 4.1.
Spots A-H of the phosphorylated casein fraction are β-caseins with molecular
masses (Mr) ranging from 31.15 to 33.80 kDa and pIs ranging from 4.60 to 4.90.
Spots I-N are αsi-caseins with lower molecular weights with respect to the
β-caseins, ranging from 27.40 to 31.20 kDa and more basic pI values, ranging
from 4.90 to 5.40 (Fig. 4.1a and Table 4.1). Spots A1 and B1 observed in the
dephosphorylated casein fraction (Fig. 4.1b and Table 4.1) are two β-caseins with
very similar molecular masses (33.50 and 32.87 kDa, respectively) but different pI
values (5.70 and 5.90, respectively). Spots C1 and 11 are two β-caseins but with
slightly lower molecular masses while spots E1, F1, G1, and H1 are &si-caseins
with different pI and molecular mass values. Under our experimental conditions,
we have not observed αsz- and K-caseins, which might be present in trace amounts
in donkey's milk, as reported by other authors (Bertino et al. 2010).

4.4Discussion
The phosphorylated casein fraction shows, after 2-DE analysis, the presence of
about 14 major spots with molecular masses ranging between 27.24and
33.74 kDa and pI values between 4.60 and 5.40 (Fig. 4.1a and Table 4.1).
N-terminal analysis showed the presence of α,1- and β-caseins, suggesting that the
heterogeneity observed in the casein fraction could be due to different degrees of
phosphorylation or glycosylation (Bertino et al. 2010; Chianese et al. 2010).
Through the NetPhos 2.0 and Netglycate 1.0 software (available on the website
www.expasy.ch), it is possible to predict phosphorylation and glycosylation on
αsl- and β-caseins. In donkey milk β-casein, there are 1l serine residues and one
threonine residue that can be potentially phosphorylated, and there is one lysine
residue that can be potentially glycosylated, whereas in α,i-casein, there 10, 2, and
1 potentially phosphorylated sites on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues.
respectively. Furthenmore, there are seven potential lysine residues glycosylated.
Experiments on casein dephosphorylation have shown that the heterogeneity
observed in the donkey's milk casein fraction is essentially due to post-transla-
tional modifications, in particular, to phosphorylation. In fact, comparing the 2-DE

assumed that spots A, B, C, and D (Fig. 4.la) assigned the phosphorylated
β-caseins, are modified after dephosphorylation of spots A1 and B1 (Fig. 4.1b),
where they show similar molecular weights but different pl values. Therefore,

prediction of glycosylation sites on β-casein. Presumably, spots Cl and I1
(Fig. 4.1b, Table 4.1), characterized by lower molecular masses (31.90 and
32.30 kDa, respectively) than the other two β-casein spots (A1 and B1), may be
the dephosphorylated splice variants of β-casein. In fact, Matéos and collaborators
(2010) showed the presence of β-casein A5 (30 kDa) characterized as a splice
variant of exon 5, in mare's milk. Therefore, in conclusion, spots A, B, C, and D of
donkey's milk β-casein (Fig. 4.la) could correspond to different isoforms with
different degrees of phosphorylation, while spots E, F, G, and H may be different
phosphorylated isoforms of splice variants. Finally, the prediction of glycosylation
sites on donkey's milk αs;-caseins highlights the potential for glycosylation of
seven lysine residues that may be responsible for the presence of different spots
(D1, E1, F1, Gl, and H1) observed in donkey's milk αsi-casein even after
dephosphorylation.

Abstract Sympathetic trunk ganglia (STG) neurons projecting to the urinary
bladder trigone of the boar were studied by coupling retrograde tracing Fast Blue
(FB) and double-labeling immunofuorescence methods. FB-positive neurons were
localized in the L1-S3 STG. Immunohistochemical staining revealed the catechol-
aminergic (tyrosine hydroxylase-/dopamine beta hydroxylase immunoreactivity)
phenotype of the majority of FB-positive neurons, which also preferentially
expressed neuropeptide Y. In addition, some of the FB-positive dopaminergic
perikarya were immunoreactive for calcitonin gene-related peptide, substance P,
vasoactive intestinal peptide, vesicular acetylcholine-transporter, neuronal nitric
oxide synthase, somatostatin, and leu-enkephalin. Functional hypotheses have been
formulated.

5.1 Introduction
The urethral bladder trigone (UBT) is a limited area of the urinary bladder where
the majority of the bladder's vessels and nervous fbers enter (Birder et al. 2010)
and where intramural neurons are more concentrated (Andersson 2002; Pidsudko
2004). The UBT has remarkable clinical importance, because it is a site for vesical

medicine (Saulnier-Troff et al. 2008; Sakai 2011; Wilson et al. 2007). Therefore, a
thorough knowledge of the innervation of this area could have important clinical
consequences. The aim of this study was to identify and neurochemically
characterize the sympathetic trunk neurons involved in the inmervation of the boar
UBT, combining retrograde neuronal transport Fast Blue (FB) with a
double-labeling immunofuorescence method.
5.2 Materials and Methods
The study was carried out on three 40 kg boars. Under general anesthesia, they
underwent laparatomy via the ventral midline from the umbilical to pubic regions.
The urinary bladder was defected caudally to expose the UBT. 50 μl of 2 %
bladder wall of the trigone with a glass Hamilton microsyringe. After an appro-
priate survival time (15 days), the animals were deeply anaesthetized and sub-
jected to euthanasia by i.v. administration of embutramide, mebenzonium iodide.
and tetracaine hydrochloride (Tanax, Intervet, and Italia; 0.3 ml/kg). Bilateral
sympathetic trunk ganglia (STG) from T1 to Col were collected. Double immu-
nolabeling reactions were carried out on 16 μm thick cryosections of the
lumbo-sacral ganglia in which FB positive (FB+) neurons were present, to high-
light the eventual co-existence of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) with dopamine β
hydrox ylase (DpH), vesicular choline acetyl transferase (VChAT), neuronal nitric
oxide synthase (n-NOS), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), leu-enkephaline
(LENK), neuropeptide Y (NPY), substance P (SP), vasoactive intestinal
polypeptide (VIP), and somatostatin (SOM).
5.3 Results
There were 1845 ± 259 (mean ± S.E.M., n = 3) FB+ neurons distributed in the
L1-S3 STG. The vast majority of them (87 ± 5 % of counted FB+ neurons) were
counted in the L7-S1 ganglia, primarily in the left ganglion. Morphologically, the
FB+ cells were multipolar with an ellipsoidal shape and a major axis of
30 ± 5 μm (200 cells measured for each animal), generally parallel to the
longitudinal axis of the ganglion. The labeled cells were isolated or clustered into
small groups of two or three neurons scattered in the ganglion. In the most positive
ganglia, the labeled cells were localized almost exclusively along one side of the
ganglion.
Immunohistochemistry showed that 66 ± 10 % of FB+ neurons showed
immunoreactivity (IR) for TH and that 92 ± 7 % of these cells co-expressed DβH
revealing the catecholaminergic nature of these neurons.
5 Distribution Pattern and Chemical Coding
29
We observed that 59 ± 8 % of FB+ neurons showed IR to NPY, whereas the
percentage of FB+ neurons that co-expressed TH- and NPY-IR was 52 ± 7 %.
The neurons projecting to the UBT showed positivity also for the other markers
tested, in the following percentages: CGRP- (24 ± 3 %), SP- (23 ± 2 %),
(%1)-NT(%1)-HA(%1)-SONU(%61)-A
and SOM-IR (12 ± 3 %).
Moreover, the FB+/TH-IR neurons co-expressed CGRP- (20 ± 2 %),
SP-(19 ± 5 %), VIP-(15 ± 2 %),VAChT- (15 ± 2 %), nNOS- (12 ± 3 %),
SOM- (11 ± 4 %), and LENK-IR (10 ± 3 %).
VAChT-, CGRP-, LENK-IR various fibers, and in minor quantities, nNOS-IR
nerve terminals were observed around the FB+ neurons.
5.4 Discussion
The combined use of FB and double immunofuorescence methods carried out on
neurons of the STG innervating the boar UBT documented that the contribution of
these neurons was quantitatively and qualitatively diversified. The distribution of
the FB+ neurons along one side of the ganglia mainly involved in the innervation
of the UBT is particular. In the past, a somatotopic organization has been
documented in the caudoventral portions of the STG for the neurons projecting to
the pig colon (Skobowiat et al. 2010).
This localization at the periphery of the ganglia, the small dimensions, the
catecholaminergic character, and/or the positivity to NPY or, less frequently to
SOM, allow us to hypothesize that the majority of the UBT projecting neurons
have a vasoconstrictor activity (Majewski 1999).
The adrenergic innervation could also be destined to the musculature of the
trigone, where in certain species, the high density of the adrenergic fibers has been
proven (Janig and McLachlan 1987; Lakomy et al. 1989, 1990). This could be related
to the change of function of the caudal part of the urinary bladder from “storage" to
"sphincter."
The FB+ neurons VIP-, NPY-, and VAChT-IR and those TH- and VIP-IR could
have a sympathetic vasodilator function (Majewski 1999).
The VAChT-IR fbers observed around the FB+ neurons presumably originate
from pre-ganglionic cholinergic neurons (Gibbins  and Morris 2000).
The LENK-IR fibers could originate from neurons located in the STG, whereas the
CGRP-IR fbers could originate from primary afferent neurons (personal
observations).

Abstract The “restitutio ad integrum" pursue in the treatment of tenodesmic
lesions might represents a tangible target thanks to the increased number of novel
cellular-based therapies. In this work, we evaluated the efficacy of the application
of platelet-rich plasma (PRP), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and PRP + MSCs
to experimentally injured sheep deep digital fexor tendon (DM n° 97/2010-B)
Our results indicate that the in vivo integration of injected MSCs was successful as
verified by the presence of green fuorescent protein GFP-positive cells.
Tissue architecture and the tendon linear fiber patterm were significantly improved
on histologic sections, especially after the use of MSCs, and the clinic evaluation

therapies that are able to increase the regeneration of damaged tissue. In particular,
the advantages of using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) isolated from adult
tissues (Martinello et al. 2010) and biomaterials such as platelet-rich plasma (PRP)
are being investigated. The therapeutical potential based on the regenerative
capability of stem cells is a real possibility, even in veterinary medicine (Ferrari
et al. 2007; Crovace et al. 2010; Watts et al. 2011), and the beneficial effects of
growth factors found in PRP are already known (Cenni et al. 2010). Moreover, the
association of MSCs and PRP likely will allow for improved in vivo growth of
implanted cells; therefore, their combined use represents an intriguing option in
the treatment of tenodesmic pathologies in the veterinary orthopedic fields.
Our research aims to study the efficacy of MSCs, together with the use of PRP,
implanted in experimentally injured tendons of sheep.
6.2 Materials and Methods
All protocols used in this research involving live animals were approved by the
University Ethics Committee for Animal Experimentation and by the Italian
Ministry of Health on 17 May 2010 (DM n° 97/2010-B). The project was divided
into three phases: (1) bilateral induction of experimental tendon lesions in three
  s         s  s
second group, and both PRP + MSCs in the third group, with a clinical follow-up
for all groups; and (3) post mortem histological analysis of tendons. For each
sheep, the left hind limb received one of the three treatments, and the right hind
limb was injected with the same volume of saline solution phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) and served as the intermal control (placebo).
Nine female Bergamasca sheep homogeneous for size and age were used in this
health of the subjects. Sheep were sedated by intravenous administration of
0.2 mg/kg Metadone (Eptadone) and 10 μg/kg Medetomidine (Sedator) and
positioned in lateral recumbency. Into each deep digital fexor tendon (DDFT),
500 IU filter sterilized bacterial Collagenase type 1A (C-9891, Sigma, Milan,
Italy) was injected bilaterally (left and right hind legs) under ultrasonographic
guidance. The injection was performed using a 23 gage needle positioned 15 cm at
the proximal-distal direction from the calcaneal bone. Seven days after creation of
the lesions, the animals were treated with one of the three methods described
above.
1 ml of PRP (972 × 10° platelets) was prepared following standard procedures
and inoculated as a liquid, taking advantage of the intrinsic coagulation factors that
induce its gelification in situ once injected. One hundred milliliters of peripheral
blood were collected from the jugular vein of sheep 8 weeks before treatment. To
isolate MSCs, a Ficoll-paque solution (Amersham Biosciences) was used
according to a protocol described previously for horse but adaptable for sheep

EE
(Martinello et al. 20l0). Isolated cells were also transfected with a plasmid
expressing the green fuorescent protein (GFP). A total of 15 × 10° MSCs were
used for each inoculation in 1 ml hyaluronic acid (Hyalgan, Fidia, Padova, Italy)
solution as a vector solution for the second group of sheep and with 1 ml PRP for
the third group. The efficacy of each treatment was monitored through clinical and
ultrasound examinations conducted regularly until sacrifice of the animal 1 month
after treatment. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses were carried out
to evaluate different parameters involved in tendon regeneration: the aligmment of
the collagen fbers, the amount, and morphology of new cells, the grade of
vascularization, the presence of infammatory elements, and the expression of
6.3Results
The clinical and ultrasound examinations revealed that in all subjects, a local
reaction to the collagenase injection was evident as well as the formation of a
peritendinous edema associated with loss of ecogenity of the tissue. The clinical
follow-up results were similar in all three groups of treated animals, and the treated
limbs showed a quicker reduction of clinical signs due to the infammatory
response respect to control limbs. The ecographic controls at 7, 14, 21, and
28 days from the treatment indicated a slow but progressive flling of the anechoic
area in the treated tendons.
Regarding the histological profile, we observed complete disorganization of the
control tendons (untreated lesions, placebo), whereas in the subjects treated with
PRP, better tissue organization was seen, although tenoblasts appeared still round
fibers was observed, tenoblasts appeared similar to proper tenocytes, and a higher
expression of collagen I was detected. The expression of collagen IlI was observed
in the placebo and weakly in tendons treated with PRP but not in tendons treated
with MSCs. The expression of matrix proteins cartilage oligomeric matrix protein
(COMP) and biglycan was increased in all treated tendons. The presence and
viability of injected cells was confirmed using an antibody against GFP in tendons
treated with MSCs alone and PRP + MSCs.
6.4Discussion
Our data allow for speculation about the ability of adult stem cells to improve
regenerative potential of tendon, because treatment with these cells stimulated
mechanisms that resulted in histological features similar to native tendons. It is
always very difficult to evaluate the quality of matrix produced using clinical and
ultrasound investigations, and our results did not show significant differences in

outcomes after the use different treatments (PRP, MSCs, and PRP + MSCs).
Histological examinations indicated that all treatments reduced the vascularization
and infammatory response. Treatment with PRP improved the general organiza-
tion of injured tendons. However, the use of MSCs seemed to increase the quality
of the repaired tendons according to histological features and because of a lack of
expression of collagen IMl; the latter is a collagen type that is present in natural
healing tendons but does not allow full recovery of the mechanical characteristics
of tendons. Moreover, only tendons treated with MSCs exhibited an elongated

Preliminary Results
L. Tidu, N. Bacciu, G. Rucco, S. Nardi, M. Santoro and B. Renaville
Abstract At the Military Veterinary Center of Grossetto, where operative dogs
from the Italian Army are raised and trained, more than 70 % of the discharges for
unfitness are due to articular pathologies like hip and elbow dysplasia. The aim of
this study was to investigate fatty acid metabolism of dogs during the growth
phase, and its modulation by a fish-based diet. Only 2 out of the 32 subjects were
affected by articular pathologies during the study. Still, both subjects had lower
levels of arachidonic acid and higher levels of docosahexaenoic acid. Moreover,
we observed that the ratio of eicosapentaenoic to docosahexaenoic acids, an
indicator of delta-6 desaturase activity, drops dramatically during the frst year in
the German shepherd.

7.1 Introduction
Hip dysplasia is one of the most common inherited joint diseases affecting large
  un s sss    p   eso 
lameness. In dogs with hip dysplasia, the head of the femur does not fit well into
the acetabulum, resulting in painful friction (Lust 1997). This pathology has a
genetic basis but is also infuenced by the environment. Animals with a similar
genetic background may show different levels of dysplasia, and animals with a
 genetic background that predisposes them to develop the disease may remain
clinically normal (Willis 1989). Nutrition is one of the main environmental factors
Indeed, a diet too rich in energy is a predisposing factor for dysplasia.
Lipid metabolism can interact with bone metabolism through various mechanisms,
such as through the balance between adipocytes and osteoblasts. Osteoblasts and
marrow adipocytes have the same bone marrow progenitor, and bone loss is often
associated with an expansion of marrow adipose tissue. Another mechanism is
through the de novo synthesis of fat. Melhus et al. (2008) demonstrated that the
fracture risk in elderly men is strictly correlated with the activity of stearoyl-CoA
desaturase (SCD), which is a key enzyme of fat synthesis. Moreover, a diet rich in
palmitic acid leads to a reduction of the calcium concentration in bones.
Also involved is the synthesis of eicosanoids, honmones that generally act at a
local level and are also known for their role in infammatory processes. Eicosa-
noids are synthesized from arachidonic acid, an omega-6 fatty acid. Among these,
the prostaglandin (PG) E2 is known as an important mediator of bone remodu-
lation by inducing osteoclast formation and increasing the synthesis of collagen
and fibronectin from osteoblasts. At the Centro Militare Veterinario in Grosseto.
Italy, where operative dogs from the Italian Army are raised and trained, more than
70 % of the discharges for unfitness are due to articular pathologies such as hip
and elbow dysplasia. As this pathology has a high incidence and no treatment is
proved to be effective, this study aimed to investigate fatty acid profiles and the
effect of dietary poly-unsaturated fatty acids as a preventive solution.
7.2 Materials and Methods
The study was conducted on 32 puppies from the Italian Army that were bom and
raised at the Centro Militare Veterinario in Grosseto, Italy.
The subjects included one litter of seven Belgian shepherds, three litters of
German shepherds (six puppies each), and one litter of seven crossbreed dogs. Half
of the puppies from each litter received a standard diet (Premium, Eukanuba) and
the other half received a fish-based diet (SANYpet S.p.A.). Each diet was fed from
weaning until the end of the experiment. Both hips and elbows were radiographed
(MAXTVET? H.F. High Frequency, Multimage) at 5 and 12 months of age. For
fatty acid analyses, blood samples were collected in EDTA tubes from the brachial
7Plasma Fatty Acid Profiles
37
vein. Immediately after centrifugation (3,000 g, 10 min), plasma was stored at
-20 °C until analysis. For each sample, fatty acids were extracted using the Bligh
and Dyer method (1959), methylated (Renaville et al. 2006), and characterized
using gas chromatography. A multivariate repeated measures analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was carried out on the proportion of each fatty acid using Proc MIXED
(SAS Institute Inc. 2010). This procedure allowed the obtainment of the variance-
covariance matrix by specifying the direct (Kronecker) product structures of a first
covariance matrix (repeated measures of a specific fatty acid across time or
another factor). Ultimately, this procedure was used because it can effciently deal
with missingrecords.
7.3 Results
The concentrations of the following fatty acids were measured: palmitate (C16:0),
palmitoleate (C16: 1w9), stearate (C18:0), oleate (C18: 1 w9), vaccenate (C18:1∞o11),

docosaepentanoate (C22:5co3, DPA), and docohexaenoate (C22:6o3, DHA).
The profile of the plasma fatty acid concentrations in dogs fed a standard diet or
a fish-based diet did not significantly differ. Unfortunately, in this study, only two
dogs presented signs of articular pathologies, both of which showed hip dysplasia
with signs of osteoarthrosis on radiography at 12 months of age. It is noteworthy
that both affected animals presented lower levels of arachidonic acid and higher
levels of both EPA and DHA (Fig. 7.1).
An interesting observation from this study is that the ratio of EPA and DHA
varies with age (P < 0.01), and this was especially observed in German shepherd
dogs (Fig. 7.2).

7.4Discussion
In this study, the onset of articular pathologies causing osteoarthritis was not
related to the diet, as only two animals were affected by hip dysplasia.
In the dysplastic subjects, both German shepherds, we observed lower levels of
arachidonic acid. This may be due to local utilization of this fatty acid in the area
of infammation as a precursor of pro-infammatory molecules, although the small
number of affected dogs did not allow a valid statistical analysis. In the small
number of studies performed in dogs (Roush et al. 2010; Fritsch 2010), other
authors only used animals affected with osteoarthritis, in which supplementation of
symptoms of affected dogs and increased the plasma concentrations of LC-PUFAs
in affected and control group dogs. The fact that we did not observe sigmificant
differences between the two diets might have resulted from the fact that the healthy
dog is able to synthesize LC-PUFAs from the other fatty acids present in the diet,
because normal dogs have normal elongase and desaturase enzymatic activity.
Therefore, what we still need to answer is whether healthy dogs should be
supplemented or not. According to Walters et al. (2010), PUFA supplementation
of normal dogs for 21 days leads to an increase of lipid peroxidation, revealed by a
reduction of GSH and an increase of isoprostane in the urine. Our results suggest
that a different metabolic mode for using LC-PUFAs is probably linked to genetic
factors, for example, that the activity of A6-desaturase in German shepherds is
different from that of other breeds studied, and decreases with age. It would be of 
interest to investigate the genetic role that A6-desaturase, or other enzymes
implicated in lipid metabolism, has on the incidence of osteo-articular pathologies.
This might reveal the implication of LC-PUFAs in the turm-over of anti-infam-
matory molecules and clarify if a specific role does exist in articular metabolism.
We can conclude from this preliminary study, that the enzymatic activity of A6-
desaturase gets reduced during the first year of life in German shepherds and that
dysplastic dogs seems to have lower plasma concentrations of arachidonic acid.

Signaling in Sperm Activation:
A Common Strategy for Different
Organisms
1. Saponaro, N. Bernabo and M. Mattioli
Abstract The molecular events occurring during spenm activation were studied
and compared in three species with very different biological features (sea urchin.
C. elegans, and human) to verify if a common signaling strategy has evolved.
The comparison was carried out by representing the molecular events involved in
spenm activation as biological networks of nodes, (the molecules) connected by
links (interactions). Analysis of the main topological parameters of the three
networks was carried out and the results were compared. In all the cases, the spenm
activation network displayed a scale-free topology and the most linked node was
[Ca'+],. We suppose that this common architecture has evolved to fulfill important
e volutionary advantages, ensuring robustness against random failure and efficiency
and speed of sigmaling.

8.1 Introduction
Spermatozoa have unique characteristics that make them different from all other
cell types: they are transcriptionally silent cells, with a peculiar organization of
DNA, and autonomous motility. In addition, they are produced at the end of
spenmatogenesis in an inactive form, needing a complex series of chemical and
physical changes collectively known as “activation" before acquiring functional
competence. This process has long been a research focus because of its important

implications in both basic sciences (developmental biology, endocrinology, and
biochemistry), and in applied sciences (andrology, male infertility, and con-
traception). Thanks to the available data, it was possible to verify that the
spermatozoa of organisms with different reproductive strategies and sexual
behaviors, such as sea urchins, Caenorhabditis elegans, and humans, are all
ronment, and has both female and male subjects. The sperm of the urchin,
initially not motile within the male genital tract, is activated and begin to move
only when released into the water where, attracted by chemotactic substances,
they move toward the oocyte and fertilize it (Barmes 1982). C. elegans is a
perate regions. There are two sexually different types of adults, hermaphrodites
(99.95 % of individuals) and males (0.05 % of individuals), which provide the
genetic variability. The eggs pass through four larval stages (L1-L4). During the
L4 stage, the hermaphrodites produce sperm and eggs, whereas males produce
only sperm. Thus, hermaphrodites can reproduce by self-fertilization, generating
individuals identical to themselves (clones), or they can mate with the males
(crossbreeding) (Fraire-Zamora and Cardullo 2010). In humans, reproduction
takes place through a process of intermal fertilization, whereby the erect male
penis is inserted into the female's vagina and the ejaculation of semen takes
place. The sperm then pass through the female genital tract, until they reach the
 oviduct, where a complex series of events promotes the acquisition of fertilizing
ability (capacitation) and fertilization.
Starting from this premise, the purpose of this work was to verify if the acti-
vation process of sperm has evolved as a species-specific signaling system or if
there is a common strategy of behavior. To this aim, the biochemical events in
question were modeled as biological networks consisting of nodes (molecules)
connected by links (interactions between molecules). The identification of com-
mon structural determinants in sperm activation was examined by comparing the
statistical and topological properties of these networks.
8.2 Materials and Methods
Data were obtained from the intemational literature using PubMed
(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) and were organized into three databases
(Microsoft Office Excel 2003, Redmond, WA) as previously described
(Bermabo et al. 2010, 2011). From these databases, Cytoscape 2.6.3 software
(www.cytoscape.org; Institute for System Biology, San Francisco, Califormia) was
used to identify networks, represented using the Cytoscape Spring-embedded
Layout. Statistical and topological analyses were conducted using the Cytoscape
plugin Network Analyzer
(http://med.bioinf.mpi-inf.mpg.de/netanalyzer/help)

For all species, the clustering coefficient was low (0.023-0.032) and did not
depend on the number of links per node (R2 always less than 0.250). The char-
acteristic path length was always between 6.6 and 7.6. In all networks, the most
linked node is the intracellular concentration of calcium [Ca'],. Glycolysis and
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation were common to all tested organisms
(Fig. 8.1).

8.4 Discussion
All analyzed networks had the typical topology of scale-free networks: a relatively
small number of highly connected nodes (hubs), with the remaining majority of the
nodes being poorly linked. This particular structure gives them a great robustness
against accidental damage. These damages will have no significant effect on the
overall system, because they will most likely involve poorly connected nodes,
which represent more than 95 % of the nodes. In addition, calcium, the most
linked node in all networks, emerges as a key molecule in signaling mechanisms of
sperm activation. This ion, acting as a second messenger, converts extracellular
stimuli into chemical responses in several pathways, including that of protein
kinase C, protein kinase A, and actin, fundamental in the activation process
(Darszon et al. 2005). The other common nodes are those involved in the energetic
metabolism of sperm. In all cases, the energy is supplied in the form of ATP.
through glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (Storey 2008).
In conclusion,the use of biological networks has allowed us to describe and
of sperm, representing an important tool for understanding the principles that
underlie the evolutionary strategies of living organisms. Indeed, it is evident that
sea urchins, C. elegans, and humans have all evolved a common strategy for
signaling and a similar arrangement in the metabolic processes of sperm activa-
tion, as indicated by similar network topology. This strategy provides important
evolutionary advantages such as robustness against accidental damage, efficiency.

Tenogenic Differentiation of Ovine
Amniotic Stem Cells Co-Cultured
with Tenocytes

Abstract Tendons are constantly exposed to mechanical loads, particularly to
injuries in sportsmen, workers, and elderly people. Spontaneous healing, slow and
incomplete, often results in scar formation. An effective treatment that is able to
stimulate complete tendon healing remains to be developed. The introduction of
stem cells that are able to differentiate into mature tenocytes represents a prom-
ising strategy for tendon repair. The aim of the present research was to assess
whether co-culture with ovine or equine tenocytes can stimulate well-characterized
ovine amniotic epithelial stem cells (AESCs) to differentiate into tenocytes.
Both co-cultures reprogrammed ovine AESCs toward a tenogenic lineage as
shown by the acquisition of a fusiform shape with a fat nucleus, by the secretion
of collagen type I, and by the expression of tendon—related genes.

effective treatment that is able to stimulate a complete healing of the tendon has
not yet been identified. Tenocytes are highly differentiated cells that have a limited
replication potential, and low and slow repair capability for damaged tissue. For
these reasons, instead of reconstruction of the tendon tissue, in most cases, scar
tissue is fonmed, characterized by hypocellularity, which compromises the bio-
mechanical properties of the tendon and causes significant dysfunction and dis-
ability. Recently, to overcome the low number of cells present in tissues during the
therapies, aimed at stimulating cellular activity and extracellular matrix production
at the site of the lesion (Longo et al. 2010). These new therapeutic approaches are
conditioned by the availability of altermative cell sources to tenocytes, of appro-
priate media in which to introduce these cells into injured tissues (scaffolds), and
of appropriate protocols of in vitro tenogenic differentiation. For tendon repair.

embryonic stem cells, and mesenchymal progenitor cells, present in bone marrow,
adipose tissue, or umbilical cord, were used (Harris et al. 2004). During osteogenic
differentiation where cells are cultured in osteo-inducing medium, it is diffcult to
trigger tenogenic differentiation in the same cells. In fact, in vitro cultures have
been tested with different cocktails of growth factors, such as BMP-12, FGF-2, and
GDF-5, or transcription factors, such as Six1 and Smad8, but the composition of
the medium needed to stimulate efficient differentiation has not yet been identified
cells by co-culture with differentiated cells, such as osteoblasts and chondrocytes,
was verified, which appeared to recreate the microenvironment of the tissues from
which the cells were isolated (Luo et al. 2009)
In this context, the infuences exerted by differentiated tenocytes regarding
re-programming of stem cells form the foundation upon which co-culture systems
aimed at producing tenocytes for tissue engineering of tendons have been devel-
oped; at the same time, these systems provide valuable information about changes
that the same cells undergo if they are inserted into tendon tissues in need of repair.
On this basis, the aim of the research was to determine whether the presence of
tenocytes, isolated from sheep or horse tendon in co-culture, was able to promote
the tenogenic differentiation of stem cells isolated from ovine amniotic membranes
(amniotic epithelial stem cells, AESCs). The results obtained demonstrate that the
co-culture system is able to induce the rapid transition of AESC morphology.

Co-culture. Biological samples were collected from animals slaughtered at the
abattoir. In particular, AESCs were isolated from fetuses, 25-35 cm in length, at
3 months of development. Calcaneal tendons were obtained from 1-year-old adult

sheep. To isolate primary tenocytes, the tendons were dissected with a scalpel, and
the central portion was divided into pieces approximately l mm in size. Each
tendon piece was mechanically disaggregated under a stereomicroscope and then
placed in a Petri dish with 2 ml medium consisting of α-MEM supplemented with
10 % FCS, 1 % penicillin/streptomycin, and 1 % L-glutamine. The plates were
incubated at 38.5 °C at 5 % COz. After 10 days, the first colonies of tenocytes
were found to have migrated from the tendon. At confluence, the cells were
trypsinized with 0.05 % trypsin/EDTA, counted in a Burker chamber, and used for
co-culture. The co-culture system was constructed by inserting “transwell cham-
bers" (Coming), with 0.4 μm pores, into each well of a 12-well plate (Luo et al.
2009). On the bottom of each well, 3 × 10? AESCs were plated; the same number
of tenocytes was placed on the membrane of the transwell. To each well was added
 2 ml medium. In this system, the two cell types develop in the same medium but
without coming into contact with each other. The plates were cultured at 38.5 °C
at 5 % CO, for 28 days. In parallel, for the same period of time and with the same
soil, an additional plate containing only 3 × 10? AESCs in each well was cultured
as a negative control for differentiation.
Morphological evaluation. The AESCs in co-culture were observed under a
stereomicroscope to assess possible morphological changes.
Assessment of differentiation. Differentiation was analyzed by immunocyto-
try, cells were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde/PBS for 15 min at room temperature
and subjected to antibodies against an epithelial factor (cytokeratin), a mesen-
chymal factor (α-SMA), and collagen type 1 (COL I). For RT-PCR, total RNA was
extracted using TriReagent (Sigma), reverse transcribed into cDNA, and used to
amplify the genes for COL I and COL III and osteocalcin (OCN).
Xeno co-culture. Ovine AESCs (3 × 10²) were placed in co-culture, as pre-
viously described, with equine tenocytes obtained from in vitro culture as
described for ovine. Cell morphology, expression of cytokeratin, α-SMA, and COL
I by immunocytochemistry, and expression of specific tenocyte genes by RT-PCR
were assessed.
9.3Results
The AESCs co-cultured with ovine primary tenocytes acquired a fusiform
appearance similar to that of tendon cells and formed circular cell aggregates
(spheroids) after 15 days in culture. At 28 days, the spheroids organized them-
selves into elongated, tendon-like, three-dimensional (3D) structures. The char-
acterization of the AESCs in co-culture, perfonmed by immunocytochemistry,
organized within the 3D structures. In contrast, α-SMA was detected only in cells
of the tendon-like structures. Finally, immunocytochemical analyses showed, in
the first 2 weeks of culture, the synthesis of intracellular COL I and its deposition
in the extracellular matrix, with abundant collagen fibers arranged within the 3D

structures. Additionally, RT-PCR analysis confirmed tenogenic differentiation of
the AESCs, showing typical expression patterms of the cells of tendon tissues: an
increase in the expression levels of COL I and OCN and reduced expression levels
of COL Il. In control cultures, no signs of differentiation by AESCs were
observed. AESCs co-cultured with equine tenocytes underwent morphological
transformation into spindle cells and aggregated into spheroids during the first
week of culture. After 28 days, in contrast to ovine co-cultures, the AESC-equine
tenocyte co-cultures did not develop 3D structures. The AESCs produced COL I,
did not deposit it outside the cell, and did not form organized fbers. In addition,
RT-PCR results reveal lower expression levels of the genes of tenogenic differ-
entiation than those found in AESCs co-cultured with ovine tenocytes. In both
cells but are mediated by soluble factors.
9.4 Discussion
Ovine AESCs have characteristics that are ideal for extended use in regenerative
therapies for damaged organs and tissues, including plasticity, the ease with which
they can be retrieved, high proliferative potential, and low immunogenicity
(Insausti et al. 20l0). The results of this research confirm these properties and
extend their differentiation capabilities to tenogenic cell lines when cultured in the
presence of primary tenocytes. AESCs in co-culture, in fact, rapidly acquire the
typical fusifonn appearance of tenocytes and are organized into cellular bundles
with 3D structures similar to a tendon. The presence of cytokeratin in the cells of
the monolayer and of α-SMA in cells of the tendon-like structures demonstrates
the transition of AESCs from an initial epithelial state to a mesenchymal state.
In addition, during culture, there is an increase in collagen, which is then deposited
outside the cells to form well-organized fbrils that are oriented along the longi-
by the study of the expression of the COL I, COL If, and OCN genes. At the end
of the culture period, AESCs display a patterm of expression similar to that seen in
tenocytes themselves
Even equine tenocytes are able to support the tenogenic reprogramming of
ovine stem cells, although this process is slower than that induced by sheep
tenocytes. This observation suggests that ovine AESCs can regenerate after
xenotransplantation into injured tendons of other species, like horse.
In conclusion, co-culture is an efficient method for differentiation, which is
based on the stimulatory effects of paracrine factors released by differentiated cells
that recreate a tendon-like microenvironment.
The co-culture system allows us to bypass normal operating limits that control
tenogenic differentiation, and it represents a promising strategy to produce teno-
cytes and/or engineered tendons that are increasingly required for the regeneration
of injured tendons by cell therapies.

Cortisol Changes in Pregnant
and Post-Partum Ewes: Effects
of Single or Twin Births
E. Fazio, M. Manera, S. Mignacca, P. Medica and A. Ferlazzo
Abstract Cortisol is a reliable physiological index of stress in sheep. Pregnancy
and post-partum conditions, the infuence of a single or a twin birth, and
simultaneous milking may represent significant sources of stress for the mother
and lambs. We characterized the adrenal response in ewes during late pregnancy
and post-partum by accounting for the possible infuence of single or twin birth on
changes in circulating cortisol levels. Cortisol levels were in agreement with
normal physiological ranges reported for sheep and with previous data obtained
from lactating ewes. There was a significant increase in cortisol levels in post-
partum compared with pregnancy, and there was a comparable trend between
birth, post-partum cortisol levels were higher in ewes with both single and twin
birth. In addition, post-partum cortisol levels were increased in ewes with male
births and both female and male births.

adrenocortical response may correlate with high or low milk yield (Fazio et al.
1994). The aim of this study was to characterize mechanisms involved in ovine
 adrenocortical response to psychophysical stress during the pre- and post-partum
period. We also compared our results with values previously obtained from ewes
in different conditions of pregnancy and post-partum periods (Fazio et al. 1994;
Medica et al. 2009).
10.2 Materials and Methods
The study design consisted of 20 healthy ewes (10 Comisana and 10 Pinzirita
crossbreds) that were 2-3 years old. These ewes were at the late stage of pregnancy
animals had access to free range pasture and were provided with hay once per day.
The animals originated from a fock of 200 ewes at a farm in Enna, Sicily
(37°34'0"N. latitude; 14°16'0'E. longitude) that was located 200 m above sea level.
Pregnant ewes that were near parturition were separated from the Hock and confined
to a pen with 80 adult animals. Because they did not have free access to pasture they
were fed hay ad libitum, 100 g of chard beet pulp, and concentrated mix (com and
broad bean). The amount fed was increased as pregnancy progressed, until they
were fed 600 g as lactating ewes during the post-partum period.
Blood samples were taken once per week from the jugular vein (10:00-12:30
a.m.), from October (at the late stage of pregnancy) to November (birth period: 13
single births and 7 twin births), and in the first four post-partum weeks. Serum
cortisol concentrations were analyzed in duplicate using a commercially available
immunoenzyme kit (RADIM Diagnostics, Pomezia, Roma, Italy). A one-way
repeated measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) was performed to deter-
 mine whether there was a significant effect of pregnancy state on cortisol levels.
The Student's unpaired r test was used to determine whether there were significant
differences between Comisana and Pinzirita crossbreds and between single and
twin births. The Student's paired t test was used to compare pre- and post-partum
cortisol values.
10.3 Results
Cortisol levels were higher in the post-partum than in the pre-partum period
(Table 10.1; (P < 0.001). This trend was also observed in the Comisana
(P < 0.001) and Pinzirita (P < 0.02) breeds. When comparing different breeds,
there were no significant differences between pre- and post-partum values.
Therefore, the analysis for the infuence of single and twin birth was performed
using all subjects combined, irrespective of breed.

Compared to pre-partum values, both ewes with single birth (P < 0.01) and
those with twin birth (P < 0.001) had higher cortisol levels in post-partum
(Table 10.2). One-way RM-ANOVA showed a significant effect of only twin birth
(F = 3.631; P < 0.001) on changes in cortisol levels. Cortisol levels were sig-
nificantly higher in post-partum with male birth (P < 0.001) or male and female
births (P < 0.05) than the pre-partum values (Table 10.2). However, there were no
significant effects of gender on cortisol changes.
10.4 Discussion
sheep (Kaneko 1989; Phogat et al. 1999) and with previous data obtained from
lactating ewes (Fazio et al. 2000; Medica et al. 2005). Our results confrmed the
observation that ovine species maintain lower cortisol levels during the pre-partum
compared with the post-partum period (Fazio et al. 1994). Lower cortisol levels in
the mother during pre-partum could be due to a secondary negative feedback effect
stimulated by high fetal cortisol levels that are even higher in ewes with twin
pregnancy. Hence, the highest mean cortisol levels observed in post-partum could
be related to the negative correlation between cortisol and circulating estrogen
levels that significantly increase in ewes during late pregnancy, with a decrease of
circulating cortisol levels that occur at the beginning of post-partum (Smith and
54
E. Fazio et al.
Dobson 2002). Moreover, the highest cortisol levels in post-partum could also be
with mothers of one lamb. However, male only or male and female fetuses induced
significant matermal cortisol increases in post-partum. In addition, it is possible that
the increase of cortisol levels in post-partum could be due to confinement of
animals near parturition and to the start of lactation, irrespective of breed and
numberof offspring.
Cortisol changes were within the wide range reported in sheep for various
physiological conditions. Nevertheless, the blood sampling time, the different
breeding for meat or milk production and nutritional factors may also be relevant
considerations.

Papillary and Chordoid Meningioma
in the Dog: Morphological Findings
and Histological Grading
S. Pavone and M. T. Mandara
Abstract Based on histomorphology, biological behavior, and outcome predic-
tion, human papillary meningioma (PM) and chordoid meningioma (CM) are
considered as grades IlI and II, respectively. In dogs, they are rare histotypes of
which only PM is recognized in the domestic animal World Health Organization
(WHO) classification system as a benign tumor. This study describes four cases of
CM and seven cases of PM in dogs, providing contributions to their histomor-
phological features in this species. Applying the current human WHO histological
classification system, we identified PM of grades I and II, and CM of grades I and
IMII. To verify a correlation between the histological grade and the biological
behavior, it is necessary to collect sufficient data on post-surgery recurrence rate
and survival time in dogs.

meningioma characterized by particular combinations of morphological parameters
are associated with a less favorable prognosis. In these cases, meningiomas corre-
spond to grades II (atypical, chordoid, and clear cell meningioma) and Ilf (anaplastic
or malignant meningioma, papillary, and rhabdoid meningioma) (Perry et al. 2007).
Conversely, based on traditional histological parameters of malignancy, the current
domestic animal WHO histological classification system of meningiomas catego
rized these tumors into two major groups: benign (meningothelial, fbroblastic.
transitional, psammomatous, angiomatous, papillary, granular cell, and myxoid
meningioma) and anaplastic meningiomas (Koestner et al. 1999).
11.2 Materials and Methods
Seven papillary meningiomas (PM) and four chordoid meningiomas (CM) diag-
nosed in the last 3 years were selected for this study. The definitive diagnosis of
PM and CM was perfonmed by routine histological examination. PMs were
observed in dogs aged 7-14 years. CM were diagnosed in dogs aged 4-16 years.
PMs were intracranial, except for a case occurring at the C1-C2 spinal segment
level. On the other hand, all CM developed in the spinal cord. The selected tumors
were graded by applying the morphological criteria used in the human WHO
histological classification (Perry et al. 2007). Therefore, meningiomas showing
low mitotic activity [≤4 mitosis/10 high-power fields (HPF)] were classified grade
 I (Perry et al. 2007). Diagnostic criteria used for atypical meningiomas (grade II)
were mitotic index (≥4 mitoses/10 HPF) or at least three of the following criteria:
pattermless sheets, increased cellularity, high nucleus/cytoplasm (N/C) ratio, ma-
cronucleoli, spontaneous necrosis, or brain invasion (Perry et al. 2007). Finally.
meningiomas showing features of frank anaplasia or at least 20 mitoses/10 HPF
were considered grade IMl (Perry et al. 2007). In addition, immunolabeling was
carried out by the avidin-biotin complex (ABC) method using antibodies against
Ki-67 antigen (clone MIB-1), to evaluate the proliferative index of the tumors.
11.3 Results
Histological examination of the seven tumors classified as PM showed typical
papillary figures containing a central core of connective tissue and small and
medium-sized vessels (Fig. 11.1). The neoplastic cells had abundant eosinophilic
cytoplasm and round-to-oval nuclei, and were arranged perpendicularly to the
vascular structures. Anisocytosis and anisokaryosis were moderate in all cases;
mitotic figures were rare (<4 mitoses/10 HPF), except for a case with 10 mitoses/
10 HPF. In some cases, papillary growth patterm was mingled with areas of
meningothelial, microcystic, and fibroblastic type. However, in all cases papillary
growth was predominant. Spontaneous foci of necrosis were detected in three

cases. Based on the criteria applied in human histological grading, five PM were
considered grade I. Two meningiomas were classified as grade II according to the
infltration of adjacent brain tissue observed histologically and reported by surgical
history. Neutrophilic infltration was observed in all cases, except one. The pro-
liferative index ranged from 9 to 24 mitoses/10 HPF in grade I PM, and from 5 to
59 mitoses/10 HPF in grade II papillary tumors.
Histologically, CM consisted of polyhedral to spindle-shaped bipolar cells, and
multipolar cells, arranged in cords and nests enmeshed in a weakly basophilic
mucinous matrix (Fig. 11.1). Sometimes, the neoplastic cells showed abundant
cytoplasmic vacuolizations. Anisokaryosis and anisocytosis were moderate to
marked. Two cases showed severe cellular atypia (high N/C ratio, irregular or
vesicular nuclei, and macronucleoli). The mitotic index was low in two cases (<4
mitoses/10 HPF) and high in the remaining two cases (25-30 mitoses/10 HPF). In
two cases, the prevalent chordoid patterm was associated with meningothelial and
microcystic areas. Foci of spontaneous necrosis were detected in three cases. Based
on the criteria applied in human histological grading, two CM were considered grade
 I, and the remaining two cases were grade I1. Infiltration of the spinal cord was not
detected in any case. The proliferative index ranged from 19 to 28 mitoses/10 HPF in
grade I CM and from 200 to 381 mitoses/10 HPF grade II tumors.
11.4 Discussion
PM is a rare histological variant of human beings and dogs. In humans, this tumor
represents 1.0-2.5 % of all meningiomas and tends to affect younger patients,
including children (Russel et al. 1989). Because of its high invasiveness of the
brain, recurrence, and metastasis rate, PM is considered grade II in man (Perry
et al. 2007). PM has been reported in dogs by Schulman et al. (1992), Summers
60
S. Pavone and M. T. Mandara
et al. (1995), and Kaldrymidou et al. (2008), and it is currently included in the
group of benign meningiomas in the histological classification of CNS tumors of
domestic animals (WHO) (Koestner et al. 1999). In the present study, canine PM
presented histological features reported in the human form. However, the tumor
did not affect young patients. Dogs older than 7 years were the most affected, in
line with the average age of onset for canine meningiomas (Patnaik et al. 1986).
Applying the morphological parameters used in grading of human meningiomas
(WHO), in our study, PMs were characterized by moderate histological malig-
nancy consistent with grades I and II. Moreover, they occurred mainly in the brain,
occasionally associated with brain invasion, as documented in two cases. This
tumor showed foci of spontaneous necrosis and neutrophilic inflammation. The
proliferation index ranged from low to medium in line with the mitotic index
detected by routine histological examination.
CM is a rare histological variant in humans and represents 0.5 % of all menin-
giomas (Couce et al. 2000). In dogs, it has been reported only in two cases (Sturges
et al. 2008). However, the morphological and immunophenotypic features, and the
biological behavior of this variant are not available in dogs. As in humans, in this
study canine CM showed histological features suggestive of chordoma, consisting in
polymorphic, often vacuolated cells, arranged in small nests or cords.
In humans, since the recurrence rate of CM and its correlation with hemato-
logical disorders (e.g., Castleman's disease) (Perry et al. 2007), this tumor is
considered grade II. Conversely, in the present study, two cases of CM were
classified as grade I and two cases were classified as grade Ill. Brain invasion was
not detected in any case. Indeed, all CM consisted of a well-circumscribed neo-
plasia with an easy surgically smooth cleavage plane. This variant seemed to
frequently develop spontaneous foci of necrosis and was associated with mild
inflammatory infltration. The proliferative index, which was medium for menin-
giomas classified as grade I and very high in those classified as grade IIl, appeared
in line with the mitotic index detected by routine histological examination and
correlated to grade of tumor. It appeared to exponentially increase in grade Ilf CM.
In conclusion, this study has reported the morphological features of two rare
histological variants of canine meningioma, attempting to provide histological
grading according to the morphological criteria used in the human classification of
meningiomas. Indeed, in the last several years, veterinary scientific community has
been calling for a grading scheme that is able to recognize a further form of
 meningioma intermediate between benign and frankly anaplastic fonn in dogs.
Contrary to the current domestic animal classification system (WHO) (Koestner
et al. 1999), in the present study, we identifed a variable range of malignancy
morphological features for canine PM, including brain invasiveness, supporting a
potential high rate of recurrence for this tumor, as seen in humans. Furthermore,
this study confirmed the presence of CM in dogs as a distinct rare histological
variant. Also this histotype this tumor is characterized by highly variable malig-
nancy morphological features, resulting in both grades I and Ilf.

These preliminary results call for an assessment of the real biological behavior
of canine meningioma. The high histological variability expressed by the same
histotype. For this aim, further studies examining post-surgery recurrence rate and
survival time must be assessed for canine PM and CM.

Abstract Currently, few information is available on the stimulation of neutralizing
antibodies (NA) to porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). The aim of the present study
inoculated with an inactivated vaccine against PCV2. Twenty-five conventional
pigs, seronegative to PCV2, were divided into two groups. Group 1 was composed of
14 animals that were injected by intramuscular route with 1 ml of inactivated
vaccine. Group 2 was composed of 11 pigs and was used as a negative control.
ELISA antibodies and NA were evaluated and a virological investigation was
performed. The vaccine did not induce any clinical signs in immunized pigs.
The animals in Group 1 developed IgG antibodies, detected by ELISA tests, between
14 and 42 post-vaccination days (PVD). In the same group, NA were produced
between 35 and 42 PVD. In Group 2, neither ELISA antibodies nor NA were
produced. No virus was isolated from any of the pigs during the experimental period.

and (6) reproductive disorders. Such diseases (Petrini et al. 2011) are currently
desigmated as porcine circovirus diseases (PCVD). Among them, PMWS is the most
studied to date. The immune response of the host organism is crucial in the path-
ogenesis of the disease. The role played by neutralizing antibodies (NA) in the
course of PMWS or after vaccination against PCV2 infection is not yet clearly
understood. Previous studies (Meerts et al. 2005, 2006) reported that NA against
PCV2 are produced during the course of experimental or natural PCV2 infection
    i a        s
(lymphoid tissue, lung, etc.). In Europe, three commercial vaccines are available for
the control of PCV2 infection. Two of them are formulated with a subunit vaccine
containing PCV2 capsid protein while the third consists of inactivated PCV2 vac-
cine with a paraffn oil adjuvant. So far, immunity induced by the above-mentioned
vaccines has been studied only by evaluating immunoglobulin isotype M (IgM) or
immunoglobulin isotype G (IgG) production by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) test. Moreover, as already highlighted, NA production after vacci-
nation has not been well studied. Thus, the present study aimed to develop a virus
pigs previously vaccinated with an inactivated PCV2 vaccine.
12.2 Materials and Methods
Twenty-five conventional pigs of 2-3 months of age, seronegative for PCV2, were
used. The pigs were tested for PCV2 twice in 1 month at their respective farms
before being transported to our animal facilities. Pigs were divided into two groups
in separate boxes. Group 1 was composed of 14 pigs injected with 1 ml of inac-
tivated PCV2 vaccine into the neck muscle. Group 2 was composed of 11 pigs that
received no treatment and served as a negative control.
The animals in Group l were observed daily for local or general adverse
reactions. Skin response at the inoculation site was evaluated and rectal temper-
 ature was taken. Nasal swabs and serum samples were collected from each pig on
post-vaccination days (PVD) 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42. Nasal swabs were used
for virus isolation on porcine kidney clone 28 (PK15-28) cell line. For the viral
identification, an anti-PCV2 polyclonal antiserum conjugated to fuorescein
isothiocyanate was used (WMRD, Pullman, USA).
Serum IgM and IgG levels were determined by a commercial ELISA test
(Ingezim PCV IgG*; Ingezim PCV IgM", Ingenasa, Spain) according to manu-
facturer recommendations.
For the optimization of VNT conditions, inactivated (56 °C, 30 min) as well as
non-inactivated serums were used. Several concentrations of PCV2 (100 TCIDso/
            
different incubation times (36, 48, and 72 h) were detenmined for different mix-
tures of serum samples, PCV2, and cell cultures.
Briefly, 50 μl of each tested serum (inactivated or non-inactivated) were serially
diluted from 1:2 to 1:4096 in Earle-minimum essential medium (E-MEM), and
12Detection of Neutralizing Antibodies in Pigs Inoculated with an Inactivated Vaccine 65
supplemented with 5 % fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics (10,000 IU/ml
penicillin, 5,000 IU/ml streptomycin, and 5 μg/ml amphotericin B).
Later, different concentrations of a virulent PCV2 62297/08 LN strain previ-
ously produced on PK15-28 cell lines, with a titer of 106.s0 TCIDs/0.1 ml, were
inoculated into each well (Chamber Slide, Nunc, DK) for 1 h at 37 °C in the
presence of 5 % CO2
After incubation, PK15-28 cell lines were added at a concentration of 2 × 104/
well and incubated for 36, 42, or 72 h.
Then, the cell lines were fixed in absolute acetone for 30 min at room tem-
perature and then left in an acetone/methanol solution (75/25) at room temperature
for 20 min. Successively, they were dried for 10 min at 37 °C.
Finally, the cell lines were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with an anti-PCV2
antiserum conjugated to fuorescein isothiocyanate (WMRD, Pullman, USA), then
rinsed five times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution, and examined for
Huorescence by ultraviolet (UV) microscopy after placing a cover slip with
mounting buffer (glycerol/PBS, 50/50). Serum samples with a known antibody
titer were added as a positive control, and E-MEM was used as a negative control.
Cells with nuclear and/or cytoplasmic fuorescence were considered infected.
12.3 Results
The animals injected with the inactivated PCV2 vaccine did not induce any
clinical symptoms or adverse reactions during the evaluation period. The viro-
logical investigations were consistently negative for the presence of PCV2 in all
animals tested.
In Group 1, IgM was detected from 14 to 42 PVD, whereas IgG was detected
from 21 PVD up to the end of the experiment. Animals of Group 2 remained IgM-
and IgG-negative during the entire experiment. No significant differences were
observed between inactivated and non-inacti vated serum samples when perform-
ing VNT. As to viral inoculum, the best results were obtained using a virus dose of
200-400 TCIDs0/0.05 ml.
An incubation time of 48 or 72 h yielded the same optimal results, while a low
reproducibility was observed after a 36 h incubation. VNT was optimized using
inactivated serum samples, 200 TCIDso/0.05 ml (4 × 10^ TCIDso ml-', 50 μl)
concentration of the test virus and a 72 h incubation period. Using such parame-
ters, NA were detected from 35 PVD on in Group 1, with a mean titer of 0.60 logz.
No NA were observed in Group 2.
12.4 Discussion
Vaccination against PCV2 appears to be an effective strategy for the control of
PCVD (Petrini et al. 201 1). Neutralizing antibodies play an important role against
viral infections, because they are able to neutralize the viral antigen and prevent
66
S. Petrini et al.
virus diffusion by inhibiting its ability to enter receptive cells. NA produced
against several viral infections can be detected early in the blood, whereas in
PCV2 infection they can only be detected 4 weeks after experimental infection
(Meerts et al. 2005).
During the frst stage of disease, NA are detected at lower titers, which do not
interfere with PCV2 replication and diffusion in the host organism, as the viral
epitopes are not recogmized by the immune system (Meerts et al. 2006).
The neutralizing activity of such antibodies appears to be mainly supported by
 IgG rather than IgM, as demonstrated by the respective specific isotypes detected
by ELISA tests.
Furthenmore, IgM produced against PCV2 seems to have a shorter persistence
in the blood (2-3 weeks), compared to what was previously described by Meerts
et al. (2006), who detected IgM up to 6 weeks after experimental infection
 Nevertheless, such a discrepancy might be due to a different sensitivity of the
ELISA test employed.
With regard to the results obtained by VNT in this study, they are similar to
those published by Meerts et al. (2006).

Abstract This study was performed to verify the safety of raw ovine milk and its
role as a vehicle for Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP)
transmission. Milk samples from 697 randomly chosen adult sheep, reared in
17 dairy focks in central Italy, were examined using Ziehl Neelsen (ZN) staining,
bacteriological culture (BC), and indirect ELISA tests. Using ELISA, we identi-
fied 70 % of MAP-infected ovine dairy farms. MAP infection was confinmed in
24.3 and 21.6 % of ELISA-positive milk samples (n = 37) by ZN staining and
BC, respectively. A fair (k = 0.43) and slight (k = 0.33) agreement was observed
between ELISA-ZN and ELISA-BC, respectively. The presence of MAP in
raw ovine milk produced in central Italy confirmed a risk of potential transmission
to humans through consumption of milk and cheese manufactured from unpas-

13.1 Introduction
Paratuberculosis, otherwise known as Johne's disease (1895), is a contagious.
chronic, and incurable granulomatous disease caused by Mycobacterium avium
subsp. paratuberculosis (MA P). MA P can infect a wide range of domestic and wild
ruminants and a series of reared animals (Pavlik et al. 2000). Transmission is
achieved by congenital and fecal-oral routes, including by food intake and/or
contaminated water. Infected colostrum and milk can be a source of infection for
young animals. In sheep, the three described fonms are paucibacillary, multibac-
 illary, and asymptomatic.
Paratuberculosis causes chronic enteritis, with animals showing lower ponderal
index values, ruffled hairs, dehydration, decrease in milk production, hypofertility.
and in the late stages, intermittent diarrhea and progressive weight loss. Paratu-
berculosis causes significant economic losses due to decreased production and
premature culling of infected animals (Smith et al. 2009). A potential role of MAP
in the etiology of Crohn's disease in humans has been suggested. In 1913, Dalziel
reported the clinical and histopathological similarities among animal paratuber-
culosis, intestinal tuberculosis, and chronic granulomatous enteritis in humans.
Recent studies have also suggested the invol vement of MAP in the pathogenesis of
human type I diabetes: 70 % positivity was observed in Sardinia, Italy, and in
England, while 40 % positive correlation was recorded in Lombardia, Italy (Rosu
et al. 2009). MAP can survive pasteurization treatments if present in milk at a high
Food safety problems and the risk of transmission of zoonotic agents have
increased with the growing use of automated raw milk systems, mainly in cattle, as
authorized by Regulation (EC) 853/2004, together with increased consumption of
cheeses made from raw milk. The aim of this work was to estimate the prevalence
of MAP infection and the degree of safety of raw ovine milk and its role as a
source of MAP infection for humans in the Marche Region (Italy), where the
production of raw milk cheeses is high.
13.2 Materials and Methods
The survey was carried out between October 2009 and July 2010. A total of 697
ewes, older than 2 years, were randomly selected from 17 farms located in the
Marche region which produced raw milk cheese. The animals were Comisana,
Massese, Fabriano, Sarda, Sopravvissana, and mixed breed ewes at the beginning,

end, or peak of lactation. From each animal, after teat disinfection with chlorh.
exidine, approximately 100 ml of milk were collected. Samples were kept at 4 °C
during transport to the laboratory and frozen at -20 °C until microbiological
investigations.
All milk samples were tested for the detection of anti-MAP antibodies using a
commercial immunosorbent assay kit (ELISA Paratuberculosis screening kit;
Institut Pourquier, France) following the protocol that the manufacturer recom-
mends for bovine milk. Briefy, serum was diluted 1:2 and pre-incubated with
Mycobacterium phlei, limiting the possibility of cross-reactions with heterologous
mycobacteria and significantly improving the specificity of the ELISA. The test was
validated when the optical density (OD4so nm) of the positive control was ≥0.350
and the ratio of OD means of the positive and negative controls was ≥3. The milk
samples were recorded as positive if they scored ≥40 %, questionable if between
30 and 40 % and negative if <30 %. All samples were subjected to BC and to ZN
staining. The isolation of MAP was performed on Herrold's egg yolk medium
(HEYM) containing mycobactin J (2 μg/ml) following the protocol previously
developed by Gao et al. (2005). A 50-ml aliquot of milk was centrifuged at
3,000 rpm for 30 min, and the serum was removed. After the addition of 20 ml of
benzalkonium chloride (0.3 %), samples were left at room temperature for 2 h with
          s   
for 10 min. The supematant was removed, and the sediment resuspended in 0.5 ml
of antibiotic solution (50 mg amphotericin B, 100 mg nalidixic acid, 100 mg
vancomycin, and BHI broth 18.5 g/L, Sigma-Aldrich, Italy). After incubation at
37 °C for 24 h, 0.2 ml of the suspension was spread on HEYM and placed at 37 *C
for 16 weeks. Periodic inspections allowed for the identification of suspected
colonies and ZN staining highlighted the typical clusters of acid-fast bacilli. Sta-
tistical analysis was conducted using STATA software version 5 (STATA Cor-
poration, College Station, TX, USA) and differences assessed using the Chi-square
test. P values <0.05 were considered significant. The degree of agreement between
tests was estimated using the kappa coefficient (k) statistic, and the k-value inter
preted as reported by Holton et al. (1998)
13.3 Results
ELISA was able to identify 12/17 (70 %) MAP-infected ovine dairy farms. MAP
antibodies were evidenced in 37 (5.3 %) milk samples with a mean optical density
of1.5 ± 0.8 (SD). In particular,7.8 % (n = 270) and 3.7 % (n = 427.
P = 0.02l) of ewes tested positive at early/late and peak lactation, respectively.
MAP infection was confirmed in 24.3 and 21.6 % of ELISA-positive milk samples
(n = 37) by ZN staining and BC, respectively (Table 13.1).
A fair (k = 0.43) and slight (k = 0.33) agreement was observed between
ELISA-ZN and ELISA-BC, respectively. When the higher antibody-level milk

samples were considered, an almost perfect agreement (k = 0.90) was attained
between milk ELISA-BC or -ZN.
13.4 Discussion
In Italy, the normative (Intesa Stato Regioni 25/1/2007) defines the criteria of
acceptability of raw milk sold directly to consumers or by automated distributors.
It individualizes parameters that must be respected for the most important bacterial
agents of food-borme illness, but these do not include emergent pathogens of public
health significance such as MAP (Intesa Govermo, Regioni e Provincie Autonome
di Trento e Bolzano N.5/CSR 2007; Autori Vari 2006).
Many authors have suggested the transmission of various pathogens to the
consumer through the consumption of raw milk. Those that play a particularly
important role are E. coli O157: H7, thermophilic Campylobacter, Salmonella
spp.,Listeria monocytogenes,Staphylococcus aureus,and Yersinia enterocolitica.
The danger of these pathogens, MAP and other zoonotic agents should lead to an
attitude of caution in consuming raw milk.
Our results indicate that almost two-thirds of the sampled farms were infected
and that MAP is excreted in the milk. Eight (47.0 %) and twelve (70.6 %) of the 17
dairy sheep farms in the Marche region were positive using BC or ZN staining
combined with ELISA, respectively.
The indirect ELISA, perfonmed on milk, was significantly more sensitive when
carried out on sheep at the beginning/end of lactation than when performed on
animals at the peak of lactation (P < 0.021). This is in agreement with previous
works of Williams and Millar (1979) and Nielsen et al. (2002), and could be
attributed by the decrease in IgG concentration during peak lactation, causing a
dilution effect due to increased milk production. The 21.6 % of raw milk samples

This study also demonstrated that an immunoenzymatic technique validated

 In conclusion, the data obtained from this study suggest that ovine paratubercu-
losis is widespread in the Marche region and that MAP, eliminated through the
milk of infected sheep, represents a potential risk of infection to humans via

should therefore be taken by the competent authority for the protection of public
health.

Abstract From May 2010 to April 2011, 242 family dogs from 14 municipalities
of the Ogliastra region (Sardinia) were examined for microfilaremia using the
modifed knott method. Overall, 32.6 % microfilaremia were recorded. The spe-
cies found were Acanthocheilonema reconditum (28.1 %), Dirofilaria immitis
(11.6 %), and Dirofilaria repens (11.2 %). The most important risk factors for

lation was also found between the altitude and the prevalence of D. immitis and
D. repens. In light of these epidemiological results, it would therefore be desirable
to implement pharmacological prophylaxis to prevent filariosis in dogs in the
monitored region.

Dog heartworms are currently one of the most important parasitological diseases.
due to the health impact in animals (i.e., Dirofilaria immitis), the possible zoonotic
implications (especially Dirofilaria repens), and recent epidemiological changes.
In particular, concerming the latter point, several authors have recently shown an
expansion of the potential vectors of Dirofilaria spp., such as Aedes albopictus (the

2010), make the epidemiological picture of canine heartworm extremely variable
For all of these reasons, it should be monitored continuously. In this context, we
have carried out an investigation to provide adequate answers to veterinarians on
prophylactic and therapeutic measures against these parasites.
The first survey carried out in Sardinia on canine heartwonm by Arru et al.
(1968) showed the presence of microfilariae in 11.2 % of examined hosts. Diro.
filaria repens was then the most widespread species (7.1 %), followed by Diro-
filaria immitis (1.6 %), and Acanthocheilonema (syn.Dipetalonema) reconditum
(1.2 %), and 1.2 % were mixed infections.
Subsequently, other investigations were carried out by Tarantini et al. (1983)
and Garippa et al. (1993), and more recently by Scala et al. (2004). The latter study
confirmed some data, such as the rate of microfilaremia (12.3 %) and the spreading
of D. immitis (3.8 %), but also an increase in A. reconditum (7.4 %) and a decrease
in the prevalence of D. repens (Scala et al. 2004). This latest survey also enabled
the identification of some areas of the island with a higher risk of infection from
D. immitis, such as the Oristano and Sulcis-Iglesiente regions, where the preva
lence of microflariae of this species was 17.1 and 7.4 %, respectively.
Unfortunately, these regions have been recently confinmed to be at particular
risk for the occurrence of filariasis by D. immitis (Genchi et al. 2010); in the
district of Oristano, the first infection from D. immitis in cats in Sardinia was also
reported (Scala et al. 2009).
In the same Oristano region, the seroprevalence of 14 % for D. immitis in a cat
population (Scala et al. 2010) was highlighted. The presence of flariosis in cats
therefore confinms the high parasitic pressure for D. immitis in this area (Dillon
1986).
In this survey, to complete the epidemiological picture of the different areas of
Sardinia, we report the results of an epidemiological survey carried out on canine
14.2 Materials and Methods
From May 2010 to April 2011, 242 blood samples collected from dogs (129 males
and 113 females) were examined with the modified knott technique. Examined
dogs, ranging in age from 6 months to 19 years (mean = 3.9 years, SD = 2.98),
were from 14 municipalities of the Ogliastra region. The sampling was carried out
with the help of the owners by collecting data on age, sex, type of hair (shaved,
short, or long), and the use of the dog. A clinical examination to ascertain the
presence or absence of symptoms of canine filariosis by D. immitis was also
performed. The identification of microfilariae was performed according to the
morphometric keys as described by Euzeby (1981).
Data were stratified by sex, age, living environment, season, and dog category,
and then processed statistically using the software EPI INFO version 6.04.

Microfilaremia was detected in 36.4 % of males (47/129) and in 28.3 % of
females (32/113). with odds ratio (OR) values of 1.45 (0.81 < OR < 2.59).
 Results of prevalence were processed by stratifying the animals by gender for each
Filariidae and are reported in Table 14.1.
No significant differences were found for the prevalence of Filariidae species in
either sex (x2 = 1.804; P = 0.179), although there was a slight tendency to
significance for A. reconditum, where higher prevalence was found in females
(x2 = 2.72; P = 0.099) with OR values of 1.62 (0.88 < OR < 2.98).
Prevalence of microfilaremia stratified by host age is shown in Table 14.2.
OR values for the various age classes of dogs with microfilaremia and for each
Filariidae are reported in Table 14.3.
The prevalence in dogs stratifed according to category is shown in Table 14.4.

D. immitis and D. repens found in 14 municipalities was negatively correlated with
the altitude of the same municipalities (D. inmitis -0.542, P = 0.045; D. repens

14.4 Conclusions
Our results show the presence of the three Filariidae previously described in
Sardinia in the Ogliastra region: A. reconditum, D. immitis, and D. repens.
Additionally, in this region, A. reconditum plays a predominant role. This species
differs from the others of the genus Filaria for its intermediate hosts, and therefore
for its mode of transmission. This finding could explain the lack of a negative
correlation between the altitude of the municipalities of the positive dogs and
prevalence rates.
The presence of A. reconditum requires the implementation of an accurate
differential diagnosis with D. immitis microfilariae that have the same length. The
prevalence of Filariidae found in Ogliastra, especially for D. immitis, requires the
implementation of chemoprophylaxis. It is obvious that, as for other coastal areas
of Sardinia, such as Oristano and Sulcis-Iglesiente, which are already reported as
risk areas for D. immitis, the Ogliastra region should be considered an area in
which this parasite is an important health problem for dogs.

Abstract Samples of serum and diaphragm meat juice obtained from wild boars
were tested for anti-Toxoplasma gondii antibodies by means of an indirect
immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT). The results were compared to evaluate
the concordance between the two matrices. A total of 160 blood and muscle juice
samples were tested. Antibodies against T. gondii were detected in 28 (17.5 %)
blood samples and in 22 meat juice samples (13.75 %). The results showed an
"almost perfect" concordance between serum and meat juice analyses
(K value = 0.86). These preliminary data show that diaphragm meat juice could
be an altemative to serum when using IFAT for T. gondii monitoring purposes in
wild boars.

Wild and farmed game meat consumption is considered as an emerging risk factor
for Toxoplasma gondii infection in humans (Kijlstra and Jongert 2008). The most
recent estimates provided by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA 2007)
reported that approximately 50 % of wild game is seropositive for T. gondii. In
wild boar (Sus scrofa, Linnaeus, 1758), epidemiological surveys conducted in
Europe revealed seropositivity rates up to 38.4 % (Gauss et al. 2005). Parasitized

wild boar meat can be a source of infection for hunters during evisceration pro-
cedures, and for consumers (Choi et al. 1997; Cook et al. 2000). This makes the
implementation of monitoring plans beginning at the hunt, as provided by Euro-
pean legislation (Directive EC/99/2003), of utmost importance. Serologic testing is
not always practical in the hunted boar because of difficulties in sample collection.
Recently, an altermative approach based on antibody screening performed on meat
juice has been suggested in swine (Dubey et al. 2005; Berger-Schoch et al. 2011).
Encouraging results for the determination of antibodies to T. gondii in meat juice
from domestic pigs were obtained by applying an indirect immunofuorescent
antibody test (IFAT) method (Ranucci et al. 2010). The aim of this study was to
evaluate the applicability of an IFAT technique conducted on meat juice obtained
from the diaphragm muscle of hunted wild boar and compare it to the traditional
serum antibody research
15.2 Materials and Methods
Serum and meat juice samples obtained from 160 wild boar hunted in 2009 and
2010 were analyzed. The blood of each animal was collected via intracardiac
puncture immediately after killing. Samples were centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for
15 min, and the separated serum was stored at -20 °C until analysis. A fragment
(2.5 x 2.5 cm) of the diaphragm muscle was taken for meat juice extraction.
Muscle samples were placed in containers (Sardstedt, Numbrecht, Germany),
maintained at -20 °℃ for 12 h, and then thawed at 4 °C for 8-12 h. Meat juice
was collected in test tubes and quantified. Blood and meat juice samples were
subjected to screening by IFAT for the determination of anti-T. gondii Immuno-
globulin G (IgG) using commercial slides (Mega Cor Diagnostik, Horbranz.
Osterreich) obtained from T. gondii tachyzoites cultured on Vero cells and fuo-
rescein isothiocyanate conjugated anti-swine IgG (anti-swine IgG FTTC conjugate;
Sigma Immunochemicals, St. Louis, MO) diluted 1/32. Sera were tested at a
screening dilution of 1/40 (cut off) (Bartova et al. 2006), while for meat juice, in
the absence of accurate bibliographic references, a cut-off value of 1/5 was
adopted on the basis of previous evaluations. All positive samples were subjected
to 2-fold serial dilutions to determine the final titer (endpoint). The concordance
between serum and meat juice overall results was calculated by McNemar's
Chi-square test, using 2 x 2 contingency tables where serum was considered as
the comparative test and meat juice as the altermative test. The overall agree-
ment between test and the one relative to two distinct serum antibody level titers
(1/40, ≥ 1/40) was evaluated by calculating the K value, interpreted according to
the following guidelines: <0.2 = slight agreement, 0.2-0.4 = fair, 0.4-0.6 =
moderate, 0.6-0.8 = substantial, >0.8 = almost perfect (Thrusfeld 2007). All
statistical analyses were carried out using EpiInfo 6.ol free software (CDC,
Atlanta, GA) and the statistical significance level was set at p < 0.05.

15.3 Results
Of the 160 animals examined, 28 serum samples (17.5, 95 % Confidence Interval
(CI): 12-24.3 %) and 22 meat juice samples (13.75, 95 % CI: 8.8-20.1 %) were
positive for IgG antibodies to T. gondii. The distribution of the results on the basis
of antibody titers is shown in Table 15.1. With regard to serum samples, 16
positive samples (57.1 %) had titers of 1/40, eight samples (28.6 %) had titers of
1/80 and four samples (14.3 %) had titers ≥ 1/160. Relative to meat juice, most of
the positive samples (15/22, 68.2 %) had titers of 1/5.
The results obtained using the two different matrices are compared in
Table 15.2. The percentage of positive serum samples was significantly different
from meat juice samples (p < 0.01).
The overall agreement between tests was “almost perfect" (K = 0.86, 95 % CI:
0.75-0.97) despite the six negative discrepancies observed. This correlation also
showed optimal values (K = 0.9, 95 % CI: 0.63-0.94) on meat juice samples
obtained from animals with serum antibody titers ≥1/40, while it was slightly
reduced (K = 0.84, 95 % CI: 0.77-1) on samples with lower titers.
15.4 Discussion
The agreement found between the two matrices allows the consideration of meat
juice as an altermative to serum for epidemiological screening in hunted wild boar.
The feasibility of muscle sampling during hunting makes this result relevant and

important, as wild boar is fundamental for the persistence of the biological cycle of
T. gondii in the wild. Although an optimal agreement was obtained, a statistically
matrices was found. The use of meat juice, therefore, cannot be considered
comparable to serum when the seronegative state is taken as a discriminant for the
infection (Berger-Schoch et al. 2011). Using the IFAT method allows us to
compare the data with those obtained in domestic pigs (Ranucci et al. 20l0). A
higher agreement was detected in wild boar (0.86 versus 0.72) due to a higher
antibody concentration in meat juice. This could be due to the amount of blood in
muscle (Mecca et al. 2011), and to the higher antigenic stimulation due to sub.
sequent re-infection, sometimes with different protozoan strains, common in the
wild. The choice of the diaphragmatic muscle was dictated both by the previous
positive observation in pigs, compared to other muscle, and by the routine sam-
pling of this muscle for the detection of Trichinella spp. in meat (Regulation EC/
2075/2005). Taking advantage of the public health aspect, it would be possible to
carry out large epidemiological surveys on the territory for T. gondii. However,
further studies have to be performed beforehand for the definition of all the
parameters of accuracy (sensitivity. specificity, positive predictive value, and
negative predictive value) necessary for the diagnostic applicability of the tech-
mique on meat juice.

Eucoleus aerophilus (syn. Capillaria
aerophila) and Other Trichinelloid
Nematodes in Dogs from Liguria
(Northwest Italy)
F. Macchioni, L. Guardone, M. C. Prati and M. Magi
Abstract As a part of a wider study that examined endoparasites of carmivores in
northwest Italy, 270 canine fecal samples were analyzed with fotation techniques.
Overall prevalence was 7.4 % for Capillaria spp. and 12.2 % for Trichuris vulpis.
This article stresses the importance of an accurate morphological and morpho-
metrical analysis to distinguish eggs of T. vulpis from eggs of the genus Capillaria.
We also suggest that different Capillaria spp. are present in the Italian dog
population.
Keywords Capillaria spp. · Eucoleus aerophilus · Dog · Italy
16.1 Introduction
Dogs can be infected by several parasitic species of the family Trichuridae that can
be difficult to specifically identify via copromicroscopic examination. The eggs of
these nematode species are characterized by a particular barrel shape and polar
plugs, with only minor morphological differences (Campbell 1991). This family
includes two subfamilies, Capillarinae and Trichurinae, which contain the genus
Capillaria and the genus Trichuris, respectively.

F. Macchioni et al.
The genus Capillaria has been revised several times. It is currently divided into
Eucoleus spp. for parasites found in the airways, Aonchotheca spp. for those living
 in the gastrointestinal tract, and Pearsonema spp. for parasites of the urinary tract
(Moravec 1982; Burgess et al. 2008).
Eucoleus aerophilus (syn. Capillaria aerophila) lives in the trachea, bronchi,
and bronchioles of domestic and wild carmivores. Infection with this parasite can
cause verminous tracheo-bronchitis. It is occasionally reported in humans
(Lalosevic et al. 2008). It is present in Europe, and North and South America
(Conboy 2009). In Italy E. aerophilus has been reported in wild animals (Rossi
et al. 1983; Balestrieri et al. 2006; Magi et al. 2009) and in dogs and cats (Traversa
et al. 2009; Di Cesare 2010). The adult females lay eggs after mating. The eggs
reach the pharynx, are swallowed, and then eliminated through the feces. The eggs
have an elliptical shape and asymmetrical polar plugs and show a reticular surface
with anastomosed ridges. They are 60-83 μm long and 26-40 μm wide (Campbell
1991). Outside of the host, they mature in 30-45 days. Infecting larvae can reach
the defnitive host directly or via an earthworm, the intenmediate host. Infesting
larvae migrate in 7-l0 days from the enteric wall of the host toward the site of
choice (Euzeby 1961)
E. boehmi (syn. C. boehmi) lives in the nasal passages and sinuses of wild and
domestic canids. This species has been reported in America and Europe (Conboy
2009). The eggs measure 54-60 × 30-35 μm. They exhibit a characteristic space
between the embryo and the shell and have a smoother surface with small wells
(Campbell 1991; Campbell and Little 1991). E. boehmi was identified for the first
time in Genmany in the silver fox (Supperer 1953)
A. putorii (syn. C. putorii) inhabits the stomach and small intestine of domestic
and wild carmivores. It has been reported in North America and Europe (Campbell
1991). In Italy it has been reported only in foxes (Iori et al. 1990; Di Cerbo et al.
2008; Guardone et al. 2010). The eggs measure 53-70 × 20-30 μm and have a
reticular surface organized in a longitudinal pattem (Campbell 1991).
P. plica (syn. C. plica) is localized in the urinary bladder of dogs, cats, and wild
carmivores. It has been reported in North America and Europe (Campbell 1991;
Whitehead 2009; Senior et al. 1980). In Italy it has been reported in foxes and in a
dog (Iori et al. 1990; Callegari et al. 2010). The eggs measure 58-74 × 23-31 μm,
and have a rough surface (Campbell 1991).
T. vulpis is a cosmopolitan parasite of dogs and wild canids and has
occasionally been reported in humans (Dunn et al. 2002; Traversa 2011). It
inhabits the large intestine, especially the cecum. The eggs, which are similar in
size to those of the genus Capillaria, measure 70-84 × 30-40 μm. They have a
typical symmetrical barrel shape, are yellowish-brown in color, and have a very
smooth surface (Campbell 1991).
The aim of this study was to confrm the presence of Capillaria spp. and
T. vulpis in dogs in an area where these parasites are known to infect wild animals,
especially foxes (Guardone et al. 2010).

16.2 Materials and Methods
Between January 2010 and March 2011, we examined fecal samples from 270
dogs (163 from hunting dogs and 107 from dogs in kennels) in the province of
Imperia (Liguria, Northerm Italy). Fresh fecal samples were examined using
flotation in zinc sulphate (specific gravity = 1.350), combined with centrifugation.
Using an optical microscope at 100× and 400× magnification, trichurid eggs were
identified according to a morphological and morphometric analysis following in
16.3 Results
Out of a total of 270 samples of fresh dog feces, 48 were positive for Trichuridae
eggs. Fifteen dogs were positive for Capillaria spp., and 28 were positive for
T. vulpis. Five dogs were infested with two species. The overall prevalence of
]          
4.3-10.5 %). The prevalence of infection with T. vulpis was 12.2 % (95 % CI,
8.3-16.1 %).
Among the 20 dogs infected with Capillaria spp., 12 were positive for eggs of
E. aerophilus (prevalence, 4.4 %; 95 % CI, 2.0-6.8 %). In nine cases, we found
eggs belonging to the genus Capillaria that had different morphological
characteristics (one dog had a double infestation of E. aerophilus and Capillaria
spp.). In six dogs (2.2 %), the eggs had characteristics similar to eggs of
E. boehmi. Most of them were partially embryonated and a few contained a living
embryo. In three dogs (1.1 %), the eggs had characteristics similar to those of
A. putori. Samples collected during this study are currently being examined with
biomolecular tools (Traversa et al., Deplazes et al., unpublished data) to confinm
these identifications.
With the exception of three dogs, which had respiratory symptoms with cough
and nasal discharge, most of the dogs infected with Capillaria spp. were
asymptomatic.
The prevalence of Capillaria spp. was 8.6 % in the hunting dogs and 5.6 % in
the kennel dogs. This difference was statistically significant. The prevalence of
T. vulpis in the hunting dogs was 2.4 and was 27.1 % in the kennel dogs.
These differences were highly significant. However, dogs from a heavily infested
kennel were present in the kennel dog samples.
Some of the 48 dogs were coinfested by Toxocara canis, Toxascaris leonina,
Ancylostomatidae,Angiostrongytus vasorum,Crenosoma vuipis, or Dipilydium
caninum.

16.4 Discussion
In Italy, the prevalence of infestation by E. aerophilus is likely underestimated.
Reports are more common in wild animals, in which the coprological diagnosis is
confirmed by finding adult worms in the trachea or lungs during necropsy
examinations. In the same geographic area of this study, we detected E. aerophilus
in the airways and A. putorii and T. vulpis in the intestines of red foxes.
The sharing of habitat between wild and domestic animals can lead to an increased
risk of infestation for domestic species. The prevalence of E. aerophilus in dogs
(4.4 %) found in this study does not differ significantly from that reported by
Traversa et al. (2009) and Di Cesare et al. (2010). The prevalence of T. vulpis
(12.2 %) found in dogs in the Liguria region contributes to the data reported by
other authors in other Italian regions (Poglayen et al. 2000; Perrucci et al. 2001 ;
Rinaldi et al. 2006; Zanzani et al. 2010).
In conclusion, the various capillarid eggs display very similar morphological
and morphometric characteristics. Therefore, new biomolecular methods should be
developed to aid in the identification of these parasites.

17.1 Introduction
Sheep farming in the Basilicata region of southem Italy (378,966 head; ISTAT,
2010) is an important part of the region's rural economy. Information on the
distribution of helminths on sheep farms in this region, and on the health aspects
related to these parasitic infections, are scant and out of date. Therefore, the aim of
this study was to update the data on the presence and distribution of helminth
survey was conducted using geographical information systems (GIS) for territorial
sampling and for the representation of results with parasitological maps. In
addition, a spatial analysis was conducted to detect possible clusters of positive
farms.
17.2 Materials and Methods
A GIS of the Basilicata region was constructed using administrative boundaries at
the provincial and municipal levels as data layers. The region was divided into
ninety-eight 10 x 10 km quadrants. The centroid of each quadrant was identified
and the farm closest to each centroid was sampled. A total of 98 sheep farms were
sampled, one for each quadrant. On each farm, 20 sheep (15 adults and 5 juve.
niles) were subjected to parasitological investigation, for a total of 1,960 subjects.
In the laboratory, individual samples were grouped into four composites (each
consisting of equal parts of five individual samples), one for juveniles and three
for adult animals.
Copromicroscopic analyses were perfonmed using the FLOTAC dual technique
sodium chloride [specific gravity (SG) = 1.200] to detect and count eggs of the
following genera/groups of nematoda: gastrointestinal (GI) strongyles, Nemato-
dirus, Strongyloides, and Trichuris. A second solution consisting of zinc sulfate
(SG = 1.350) was used to detect and count eggs/larvae of Skrjabinema, Fasciola,
Calicophoron, Dicrocoelium, Moniezia, and lungworms. Coprocultures were
performed for each farm to identify the genera of GI strongyles (van Wyk et al.
2004). The GIS software ArcGIS 9.3 GIS (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA) was used
for spatial analysis to detect cluster distribution of each parasite.
17.3 Results
The results showed the presence of GI strongyles on 91.8 % (90/98) of farms,
including Haemonchus 76.9 % (78/98), Trichostrongylus 91.8 % (90/98), Tela
dorsagia 88.8 %(87/98).Cooperia 77.6 % (76/98).and Oesophagostomum

39.8 % (39/98), Nematodirus 24.5 % (24/98), Strongyloides 4.1 % (4/98), and
Skrjabinema 2 % (2/98). The most frequent lungworms were Muellerius, found on
37.8 % (37/98) of farms, followed by Neostrongylus 13.3 % (13/98), Proto-
strongylus 4.4 % (4/98),Cystocaulus 2 % (2/98), and Dictyocauius 2 %(2/98).
Cestoda of the genus Moniezia were found on 35.7 % (35/98) of farms. Among
trematoda, D. dendriticum was found on 61.2 % (60/98) of the farms, followed by
C. daubneyi on 10.2 % (10/98), and F. hepatica on 1 % of the fanms (1/98). The
two parasitological maps with proportional circles shown in Fig. 17.1 show the
distribution and intensities of D. dendriticum and C. daubneyi. Spatial analyses
showed a cluster distribution patterm for both D. dendriticum (P = 0.05) and C.
daubneyi (P = 0.01).
17.4 Discussion
This survey showed a noteworthy distribution of helminths on sheep farms of the
Basilicata region. The most prevalent helminths were GI strongyles, detected on
most of the farms (91.8 %), and comprised the genera Haemonchus (76.9 %),
Trichostrongylus (91.8 %), Teladorsagia (88.8 %), Cooperia (77.6 %), and
Oesophagostomum (72.5 %). Lungwonms were also widely distributed (50 %) and
Muellerius was most commonly detected genus (37.8 %). These findings are
consistent with similar studies performed in other Apenninic areas of southerm
Italy (Cringoli et al. 2002; Biggeri et al. 2007). The prevalence values for Trichuris
(39.8 %), Nematodirus (24.5 %), Strongyloides (4.1 %), and Skrjabinema (2 %)
are also consistent with those recently reported on sheep farms in other Italian
regions (Bosco et al. 2011). D. dendriticum was the most prevalent liver fuke
b
A. Bosco et al.
(61.2 %), whereas F. hepatica was reported on only 1 % of the farms. Param
phistomes (C. daubneyi) were reported on 10.2 % of farms.
Spatial analysis detected an interesting cluster distribution of D. dendriticum
and C. daubneyi in the study area, likely due to soil and environmental charac-
teristics on the biology of the intermediate hosts. Further studies are needed to
clarify this fnding.
In conclusion, considering that the health status of livestock is fundamental for
the productive and reproductive performances of these animals, the economic
impact of this parasitological situation is likely very significant, although not
quantified in this study (Cringoli et al. 2004, 2007, 2008). Local knowledge about

Effects of Veterinary Drugs on Swimming
Activity in Two Freshwater Organisms
M. Dalla Bona, V. Di Leva and M. De Liguoro
Abstract Alterations in swimming activity may infuence ecologically relevant
 performance, such as predation avoidance, prey capture, growth, stress resistance,
mating, and longevity. The evaluation of swimming activity supports toxicological
investigation with endpoints other than traditional LCsos values and may aid in
investigating the environmental relevance of low-level exposures and determining
"no observable effect concentration" (NOEC) and “lowest observable effect
concentration" (LOEC). In this chapter, some veterinary antibacterial compounds
that may contaminate the aquatic environment due to their use in livestock and/or
mass aquaculture treatments are evaluated for their effects on swimming activity
of Daphnia magna (primary consumer) and Poecilia reticulata (secondary con-
sumer). Results show that the chosen endpoint may call to the attention of eco
toxicology some compounds that are otherwise negligible, based on lethality tests.

18.1 Introduction
Behavioral changes represent integrated responses of the whole organism. These
altered responses may be associated with reduced fitness and survival, resulting in
adverse consequences at the population level (Bridges 1997).
Until recently, behavioral endpoints have been slow to be integrated into
aquatic toxicology, not only because of the poor umderstanding of their conse-
quences on ecologically relevant activities, such as predation avoidance, prey

progress in the ease, utility, and affordability of obtaining. interpreting. and
applying behavioral endpoints in a variety of applications, including aquatic
toxicity tests, possible. Currently, after exposing an aquatic organism to a sub-
stance, it is possible to acquire a film by means of video tracking software and
analyze it to accurately evaluate the swimming activity through graphical and
statistical elaboration of data.
Acute toxicity tests, while demanding little time and labor, are generally less
sensitive than chronic toxicity tests. Their sensitivities can be improved by eval-
uating sublethal effects such as the behavioral consequences. Generally, the acute
toxicity (lethality) of antibacterial toward nontarget organisms such as crustaceans
and fishes occurs only at concentrations higher than 100 mg/L; substances with
ECso values higher than this threshold are considered safe for the aquatic envi-
romment (Regulation 1272/2008/EEC).
In this chapter, some methodologies are described that can be used for swim-
ming activity evaluation of fishes and crustaceans after exposure to antibacterial. It
is shown that significant effects of these drugs on swimming activity may be
detected at concentrations that are unable to cause any lethality of the test
organisms.
18.2 Materials and Methods
In accordance with the fish acute toxicity test (OECD 203 1992), the following
compounds were tested at a concentration of 100 mg/L (limit test) on Poecilia
reticulata: enrofoxacin (EFX), its metabolite ciprofloxacin (CFX), trimethoprim
(TMP), sulphamethazine (SMZ), sulphaguanidine (SGD), and sulphaquinoxaline
(SQO). As no lethality was recorded after 96 h, the test was extended to 14 days
(OECD 204 1984). At the end of this prolonged toxicity test and before sacrificing
the animals with an overdose of MS-222, each group of seven fish was allocated in
a small, round tank (20 cm in diameter) under standard conditions of light and
temperature and filmed from above for 12 min using a digital video camera (JVC
EVERIO GZ-MS100E); the middle 2 min of each video sequence was analyzed on
a PC AcerAspire M3201, using Swistrack 4.0 (Lochmatter et al. 2008). The spatial
coordinates (in two dimensions) of the movements were then exported to Excel
(Microsoft) software to perform graphical and statistical elaborations.
Based on the results of this test, the following compounds were selected to be
tested on Daphnia magna: EFX, TMP, SGD, and SQO. Ten daphnids (6 days of
age) were allocated in Roux fasks (75 cm?) at 20 ± 1 °C and with a 16 h pho-
 u aaoss nodoo as e o u t oy asodxa pue (x h) oado
medium (Klittgen et al. 1994) at 100 mg/L concentration. At the end of the test,
each daphnid was frontally filmed for 5 min (see above), and the middle 2 min of
18 Effects of Veterinary Drugs on Swimming Activity in Two Freshwater Organisms

the video sequence was analyzed on a PC Acer Aspire M3201 using Kinovea
software (freeware). For all tests, statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA
followed by Dumnett's test with the SPSS Statistics?
17.0 application. This
experimentation was authorized by the Italian Ministry of Health (decree n. 175/
2010-B).
18.3 Results
No lethality was observed in any of the tests. In Fig. 18.1, box plots of swimming
activity of fish (a) and daphnids (b) exposed to the various compounds are shown.
With the exception of SMZ (in fish) and SGD (in daphnids), all the drugs tested
elicited a statistically significant reduction of the traveled distance. In Fig. 18.2, as
an example, video recordings of the controls and subjects exposed to TMP are
compared, for both P. reticulata (a) and D. magna (b).
18.4 Discussion
Based on the results from the algal toxicity tests (ECso < 100 mg/L), TMP is
already classified as ^harmful to aquatic organisms' and ‘possibly able to cause
long-term adverse effects in the aquatic environment' (Phrases R42 and R43).
However, as frequently happens, an acute lethality test on Brachydanio rerio
(Halling-Sorensen et al. 2000) yielded negative results, pointing to a no observed

reticulata, these data would have been confirmed by our test, but referring to the
sublethal endpoint (swimming activity inhibition), exposure to 100 mg/L is not
devoid of effects. In fact, the protocol for the acute lethality test (OECD 203 1992)
recommends the importance of recording any sublethal effect. Thus, it will be
important, in the future, to evaluate the same endpoint with scaled concentrations
of TMP to determine both the NOEC and the ECso with confidence limits
Swimming activity inhibition was also recorded with the other five compounds;
more detailed study is therefore recommended, although with less urgency than
with TMP. It is worth noting that in this study, the evaluation of more refined
components of swimming that could increase the sensitivity of the tests has not
been considered. These actions include acceleration, freezing, angles of tums,
horizontal and vertical distribution, predator avoidance, etc. In Fig. 18.2, for
example, one notes that the control group swims more peripherally (P. reticulata)
or has a higher tendency to move in the water column (D. magna) compared to the
TMP-exposed groups.
OECD protocols for both acute (immobilization) and chronic (reproduction)
tests on D. magna require the use of newborm specimens. However, in our novel
approach to the evaluation of the effects of acute exposure to drugs on swimming
activity, we have chosen to use 6-day-old daphnids. This age was chosen, because
the organisms are sufficiently developed to be filmed with a conventional video
camera but not yet ready for reproduction. Indeed, reproduction in D. magna
causes a physiological fuctuation of swimming activity that would unavoidably
 interfere with the test results. The test was quick and easy to perform, and showed,
at least with TMP, to be more sensitive than the traditional immobilization test
(OECD 202 2004) in which the calculated ECso was 149 mg/L (De Liguoro et al.
2009).
Taken together, our results confrm that swimming activity is a valuable end-
point in aquatic toxicology and indicate the need for more in-depth studies on
TMP toxicity. It is not clear whether the strong effect on swimming activity is
simply the consequence of the metabolic disturbance of folate synthesis caused by
the drug or whether the effect might be related to direct impacts on the nervous
system of aquatic organisms. It should be noted, in this regard, that TMP is largely
used in both human and veterinary medicine. Furthermore, its use has been
18  Effects of Veterinary Drugs on Swimming Activity in Two Freshwater Organisms 101
extended to aquaculture facilities, where nonnegligible inputs of the compound
can be directly released into the aquatic enviromment when metaphylactic treat-
ments are in place. Moreover, TMP is poorly biodegradable, having a long
(>22 days) environmental half-life for primary degradation (Chemwatch 2009),

and are as persistent in the environment (De Liguoro et al. 2010).

Interdisciplinary Evaluation of Toxicity
in Ostreopsis Ovata: Algal Biotoxins
A. Ferrari, I. Schiavetti, C. Bolognesi, D. Pavino and B. Vivaldi
Abstract An interdisciplinary study was performed to characterize the biotoxins
produced by Ostreopsis ovata and their consequences for health and food safety.
O. ovata, a benthic dinoflagellate widespread in tropical seas, has recently also
colonized several areas of the Italian coast. O. ovata causes respiratory symptoms
in exposed humans, and microalgae have the ability to release ostreocina during
fowering, which accumulates in many aquatic organisms. The results show a
significant correlation between time of death in mice subjected to chemical
analysis and quantification of biotoxins performed by mass spectrometry, indi-
cating its validity in detecting the toxicity profile of O. ovata. The potential
mutagenicity of toxins detected by genotoxic analysis has yet to be detenmined.

19.1 Introduction
Ostreopsis ovata is a benthic dinofagellate that is most commonly found in
tropical seas but has recently also colonized several portions of the Italian coast,
due to peculiar climatic and environmental conditions. Marked evidence of its
presence was found between 2005 and 2006 in Liguria and Sicily.
Today, O. ovata is believed to cause respiratory symptoms in exposed people,
but the specific cause-effect relationship has not yet been identified. In addition,

potential envirommental risks have been identified, associated with the capacity of
the microalgae to release ostreocina during fowering. Ostreocina is a palytoxin-
like substance that accumulates in many aquatic organisms and concentrates along
the food chain.
Within the framework of a research project funded by the Ministry of Health,
the Experimental Zooprophylactic Institute of Piedmont, Liguria and Aosta Valley
(IZSPLV)—Genoa Section, in cooperation with the Liguria Regional Agency for
Emvironmental Protection(ARPAL).National Cancer Research CentreGenoa
(IST),Liguria Regional Government, and Marine Research Centre of Cesenatico
(CRM), has conducted an interdisciplinary (biotoxicological, chemical, and
genotoxic) study aimed at characterizing the biotoxins produced by O. ovata and
19.2 Materials and Methods
Based on the literature available and on experience, the sampled area included the
first few meters of submerged beach to approximately 1 m of depth in the water
column. Protected and sheltered coast sections, characterized by both natural and
artificial substrates, are the most exposed to O. ovata fowering.
Furthermore, based on risk signals collected during previous bathing seasons, as
to be at risk of algal flowering.
A report was filed for each sampling point, prepared in cooperation with
ARPAL, including all infonmation and details regarding the sampling site and
environmental physical-chemical parameters. The sites selected for the study
were:
● For the Gulf of Genoa: Pontetto, Bagnara, Cinque Maggio
· For the Province of La Spezia: Falconara, Fiascherino, Tellaro
● Sites dedicated to mussel farming in the Gulf of La Spezia: Diga Levante, Diga
Ponente, Diga Centro, Portovenere, Palmaria.
Biotoxicity tests were performed on 400 mussel samples and 40 echinoderm
samples. The investigation was conducted on mice (mouse test), in compliance

as the official reference method for detecting the presence of all classes of toxins
that may be associated with paralytic (PSP) and diarrhea (DSP) molecules (DM
16/5/2002). The mouse test evaluates the acute toxicity of an extract of the edible
body of molluscs injected into the peritoneum of adult mice (Swiss albino mice of
18-20 days of age). Homogenized mussels were extracted with 1:1 acetone and
methanol according to the indications given in protocol 2. Subsequently, the
extracts were combined and a further extraction was performed with 1:3 dichlo-
romethane and methanol to isolate two groups of toxins: (l) okadaic acid toxins
s
105
and their analogs dinophysistoxin, pectenotoxins, and DSP lipo-soluble toxins,
identifed as azaspiracid, in a dichloromethane extract; (2) yessotoxins and paly-
toxins in a methanol extract. The lipidic residues obtained from the evaporation of
solvents were resuspended in a Tween 60 solution. Intraperitoneal injections into
three mice were then performed (Mouse Test). Toxicity was assessed based on the
death times of the mice, and the class of toxins responsible for the death was able
to be recognized.
High performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) tests
(Riobo et al. 2006) were performed with a Varian 1,200 L Triple Quadrupole type
device (Varian Inc., Walnut Creek, CA, USA) on the digestive gland of the
mussels, where the toxins are most concentrated. Specifically, 22.5 g of hepato-
pancreas were extracted in Ultra Turrax?@ three times with 50 mL of 90 % MeOH.
The extract was brought to a final volume of 160 mL with methanol. Seven
millilitres, corresponding to 0.98 g of tissue, were evaporated and reconstituted in
2 mL of 50 % MeOH. The samples then underwent a fuid-fuid partitioning with
CHzCl, to remove lipids from the extract and then purification with an OASIS
MAX cartridge (Waters). The eluate was further concentrated 10 times before
injecting 20 μL into the HPLC-MS.
The palytoxin was separated by chromatography using a Polaris C18, 3 μm,
50 x 2.00 mm column (Varian Inc.) and gradient elution with water and aceto-
was perfonmed considering the transitions with a more intense response, i.e., m/z
327 > 75 and m/z 1,278 > 327, and by comparison with the peaks obtained from
different dilutions of a palytoxin standard.
Genotoxicity was tested with the Comet assay and DNA damage induction. In
particular, the first assay, simple and sensitive, was perfonmed in the alkaline
version proposed by Singh et al. (1988). The slides were prepared with cells
 u pa u p u t rg  as o sa o uaa ais
lysis solution. Electrophoresis was then conducted for 25 min with the slides in an
alkaline environment at 25 V and 300 mA, to be later incubated in a neutralizing
solution, colored with ethidium bromide, and dehydrated. After observing the
slides under a fuorescence microscope, the comets were classifed into four
based on the evaluation of 200 comets per slide

sensitive to this class of biotoxins (Wiles et al. 1974). This assumption suggests
that further environmental monitoring trials for palytoxins are needed using sea
urchins.
Our results show an appreciable correlation between the death times of the mice
and the chemical quantitation performed with a mass spectrometer, indicating the
validity of this device in detecting the toxic profile of O. ovata. The potential
mutagenicity of the toxins detected in genotoxic tests has yet to be confinmed.
In the light of these results, we consider it necessary to refine the investigation
methods proposed and to adopt an interdisciplinary approach that may allow
researchers to obtain a global picture of the different classes of algal biotoxins.

Union (EU). Antibacterial residues were detected in 5 % of milk samples tested by
an inhibition assay (Delvotest SP). The results were confinmed by specific receptor
assays (SNAP tests, IDEXX), and 40 of 52 samples were positive for beta-lactam
antibiotics. The presence of residues of ampicillin, amoxicillin, penicillin G, and
cloxacillin (12/25 at concentration > Maximum Residue Limits) was confirmed
by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.

20.1 Introduction
Dairy fanming is a key sector agriculture in Kosovo. The presence of veterinary
drug residues in milk is becoming important to Kosovo consumers. Antibacterial
drugs, such as beta-lactams, tetracyclines, and sulphonamides, are routinely used

for prevention and therapy of diseases in milking cows in Kosovo, but limited data
are available regarding the presence of antibacterial residues in milk (Rama et al.
2010). Afatoxins are mycotoxins of major concem to the dairy industry. The
presence of afatoxin M, (AM,) in milk and milk products is considered unde-
sirable. The risk of AM, should not be underestimated, due to the unpredictability
of weather and ambient conditions and the inability of certain agricultural systems,
characterized by poor economic conditions and/or lack of knowledge, to face and
manage mycotoxin prevention and contamination (Prandini et al. 2009).
This study was performed to assess the occurrence of AM; and antibacterial
residues in milk produced in Kosovo in 2009. The aim of the project was to
support the development of a monitoring plan and to underline the importance of
continuous surveillance for AM; and antibacterial residues in milk to ensure
consumer health.
20.2 Materials and Methods
Milk samples were collected over the whole of 2009, in six regions of Kosovo
(Prishtina, Gjilan, Mitrovica, Peja, Gjakova, and Prizren). The sampling of raw
milk was territorially programmed in such a way that the results could describe the
level of milk contamination in the whole territory of Kosovo.
Evaluation for AM; was performed on 675 milk samples: 524 samples came
from milk collection points (MCPs), 129 from individual farms, and 42 samples
were ultra high temperature (UHT) milk from retailers. A total of 1,015 samples
were collected to be analyzed for antibacterial contamination: 826 came from
MCPs, 150 from individual cows, and 39 samples of UHT milk from retailers.
The screening tests were performed at the Kosovo Food and Veterinary
Agency. Concentrations of AM, were determined by an enzyme-linked immu-
nosorbent assay (ELISA) commercial kit (Tecna, Trieste, Italy). All milk samples
were screened within 24 h for the presence of antimicrobials by Delvotest SP
(DSM Food Specialties, Dairy Ingredients, Delft, The Netherlands). All Delvotest
SP-positive samples were checked with a SNAP test (IDEXX Laboratories,
Westbrook, ME, USA) specific for penicillins, tetracyclines, and sulphonamides
Only the samples that were confinmed positive by the second screening test
underwent the confirmation analysis by liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry (Rama et al. 2011).
20.3 Results
The detection capacity of the ELISA test was lower than the maximum permitted
level of AM. The good performance of this method was confirmed by the sat-

0.32 and 0.65) (Progetto Trieste—Final Report Mycotoxins). In this study, all milk
samples had values below the maximum level (50 ng/kg) determined by the
European Union (EU) and Kosovo legislation. The level of AM; was below the
detection capacity of the test in 97 % of samples analyzed. The mean concen-
tration of AM, detected in the 20 contaminated samples was 12 ng/kg.
Table 20.1 shows the results of the antibacterial residue analyses. The overall
positivity rate on the Delvotest SP was near 5 %. The positivity rates for farms,
MCPs, and UHTs were 4.9, 6.6, and 2.5 %, respectively.
The samples from the region of Peja showed the highest rate of contamination.
When the 52 samples that reacted positively on the Delvotest SP were analyzed
further with the SNAP test for penicillins, tetracyclines, and sulphonamides, only
40 samples (77 %) were positive for beta-lactams. Twenty-five of these samples
were randomly selected to be confirmed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry. Sixteen samples were positive for residues of amoxicillin, penicillin
G, or cloxacillin (12 at a concentration higher than the Maximum Residual Limits).
20.4 Discussion
The data presented in this chapter, obtained from the frst monitoring plan per-
formed in Kosovo to investigate the presence of AM, in milk, are encouraging.
The results pointed out that the content of AM; in the contaminated samples was
always below that allowed by EU legislation. Comparison of data from neigh-
boring Westerm Balkan countries showed similar results. AM; was detected in
30 % of Serbian pasteurized and UHT milk but none of the samples exceeded the
concentrations of 50 ng/kg (Polovinski-Horvatovic et al. 2009). In Croatia, 98.4 %
of the analyzed milk samples had AM， values below the EU maximum level
(Bilandzic et al. 20l0). The level of AM, milk contamination in Kosovo is dif-
ferent from that in countries with similar agricultural practices but different cli-
mates, like Iran and Turkey, where AM, in milk currently appears to be a serious
public health problem (Unasan 2006; Kamkar 2008). Due to the unpredictability of
climatic and environmental conditions, it is essential that the program of moni-
toring of AM, in milk in Kosovo will continue, to avoid an undetected problem.

G. Gallina et al.
The results of antibacterial residue analyses showed that milk samples collected
from different parts of Kosovo were often contaminated, most significantly with
beta-lactams.The results confinmed that penicillin residues were represented
mainly by penicillin G, amoxicillin, and ampicillin, often occurring at concen-
trations higher than the MRL set by the EU (Ghidini et al. 2002; Holstage et al.
(McEwen et al. 1991; Mitchell et al. 1998) and refect the frequent use of intra-
mammary infusions containing beta-lactams for the treatment of mastitis. The
results from UHT milk reported in this study revealed levels higher than those
reported in The Netherlands and Costa Rica (Wit et al. 1996; Bayenes et al. 1999).
Results from Kosovo were in agreement with those reported by Fonseca et al.
(2009), confinming the presence of antibiotic residue in UHT milk produced and
sold in Brazil.
Given the considerable levels of residues detected in raw milk and the worri-
some consequences for consumers, competent authorities should apply continuous
monitoring programs to produce safe milk products which pose no health risk to
focus the problem and implement effective corrective actions to reduce milk
contaminants. Further studies will be conducted to evaluate the performance of
several screening tests for milk residues, to identify methods that are easy to use,
suitable for a broad spectrum of antimicrobials, and inexpensive.

heavy metal (Pb, Cd, and Hg) levels in liver and kidney of 38 dogs living in an
urban habitat (city of Naples). Tissues were homogenized, digested in a microwave
digestion system, and analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry. The results of
this study showed generally low levels of heavy metals in tissues of all examined
dogs; only mercury concentrations in kidneys of pet dogs were higher than in stray
dogs, and no significant age-dependent differences in metal levels were shown
between the two groups. In conclusion, these results suggest the involvement of ad
hoc-formulated pet food exposure to heavy metals in domestic animals.

presence is partly attributable to the natural abundance of heavy metals in the
earth's crust in addition to human activities. Some of these metals, besides not
being essential for living organisms, are significantly toxic. Given the paucity of
the scientific literature on the exposure of domestic species to heavy metals (Sakai
et al. 1995; Balagangatharathilagar et al. 2006; Lopez-Alonso et al. 2007), the
 purpose of this study was to undertake a retrospective analysis of the levels of lead,

cadmium, and mercury in tissues of dogs (stray and domestic) that died from
various causes, all living in the urban area of Naples.
21.2 Materials and Methods
As part of the necropsy of the 38 dogs from the Department of Pathology and
Animal Health, University of Naples “Federico II,” livers and kidneys were
collected and stored at -20 °C until analysis. Aliquots of homogenized bodies
were taken, after thawing, equal to 0.50 ± 0.01 g; wet mineralization of the
samples was performed by treating each aliquot with 4.0 mL of 70 % HNO3
(Carlo Erba) and 1.5 mL of 30 % HzOz (Baker Analyzed) in a total volume of
8.0 mL (difference made with deionized water) for atomic absorption spectroscopy
(Best Chemicals) in a microwave oven (Milestone, FKW) at a temperature of
190 °C. The sample was analyzed for lead and cadmium levels using an atom-
ization technique in a graphite fumace (AAS 800, Perkin Elmer) and for total
mercury levels using the hydride generation technique (AAS 31 10, Perkin Elmer).
Quantification was carried out after extermal standardization, correcting for
recovery percentage. The animals, divided into domestic (n = 19) and stray
(n = 19) groups, were further divided into groups according to age (Group I:
2-9 years, Group II: 10-17 years). The results obtained were statistically pro-
cessed using the Student's t test.
21.3 Results
The results of this work are summarized in Table 21.1. With regard to lead, which
was present in all examined samples, levels between 0.074 and 0.949 mg/kg
(Xm = 0.321) in the liver and between 0.049 and 1.001 ppm in the kidney

(Xm = 0.293) were detected. For cadmium, found in all kidney samples and 95 %
of all liver samples, the concentrations ranged from ND to 0.352 mg/kg
(Xm = 0.093) in the liver and between 0.011 and 0.984 mg/kg (Xm = 0.259) in the
kidney. Finally, for mercury, present in 83 % of all samples, values between ND
and 0.418 mg/kg (Xm = 0.054) were found in liver samples, whereas in the kidney,
the levels of this metal ranged between ND and 0.328 mg/kg (Xm = 0.040)
The higher concentrations of mercury were found in domestic subjects
21.4 Discussion
The results of this study showed that all subjects examined have been exposure to at
least one heavy metal, although hepatic and renal concentrations of all metals were
2009). In particular, with regard to lead, measured concentrations were higher than
the other metals but lower than values considered “normal" in the kidney of the
canine species (Beretta 1984). For cadmium, the highest levels were found in the
kidney (Xm = 0.25 mg/kg), which represent, as well-known, the organ in which
this metal has a particular tropism. Even mercury concentrations detected provide
signs of a generally low exposure to this metal, but its concentrations in the kidney
were higher in domestic than in stray dogs (P < 0.ol). With regard to age, no
statistically significant differences were detected between the two groups.
Despite the limited number of subjects and the different variables inherent in
such a retrospective study, the results of this work, which we consider preliminary,
provide guidance to continue a wider study of different nutritional statuses and
living environments. In particular, the major concentrations of mercury found in
domestic dogs might be considered as a starting point to investigate the role of diet
in exposure of pets to contaminants that may end in inadequately controlled
commercial food.

22.1 Introduction
Reports of ultrasound examination of the abdominal lymph nodes and their normal
size ranges in healthy adult dogs have recently been published (Agthe et al. 2009;
Llabres-Diaz Francisco 2004; Mayer et al. 2010). This work was possible due to
the availability of probes with higher resolution and ability to identify very small
anatomical structures.
Abdominal and pelvic lymph nodes are classified as visceral or parietal
depending on lymph drainage from the viscera or parietal regions of the abdomen.
Among the former, the jejunal lymph nodes are the most frequently evaluated;
among the latter, the hypogastric and the medial iliac are the most frequently
evaluated.
The jejunal lymph nodes, usually found as a pair, are the largest of the
abdominal lymph nodes and lie at the root of the jejunal and ilial mesentery, in

close proximity with the cranial mesenteric vessels. They are also referred to as the
cranial mesenteric lymph nodes, and drain the jejunum, ileum, and pancreas
(Bezuidenhout 1993). The medial iliac lymph nodes are parietal lymph nodes, the
largest in the iliosacral lymphocenter, and are found in variable numbers stretching
cranially to the deep circumfex iliac arteries and aorta and caudally to the origin
of the extemal iliac arteries. The left node is often located in a position more
ventral than the right one. They drain the genital organs, peritoneum, anus, rectum,
colon, skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscles of the pelvic region, including the
tail (Bezuidenhout 1993). The hypogastric lymph nodes are located in the comer
formed by the intermal iliac vessels and the median sacral artery and belong to the
same lymphocenter. They are smaller than the medial iliac nodes and have a
spherical shape. These lymph nodes drain almost the same areas as the medial iliac
nodes (Bezuidenhout 1993).
The abdominal lymph nodes are usually readily detectable in young subjects
(Pugh 1994), but the size of these lymph nodes has not yet been determined in
healthy puppies.
Serial ultrasound evaluations of the jejunal, medial iliac, and hypogastric lymph
nodes in clinically healthy subjects aged between 6 and 12 weeks were conducted
to identify a size reference range and to define what constitutes enlarged
abdominal lymph nodes in puppies.
22.2 Materials and Methods
Ultrasound assessment of abdominal lymph nodes was conducted every 15 days in
12 puppies (2 boxers, 8 American Staffordshire terriers, and 2 Maremma sheep-
dogs; seven females, five males), from 6 until 12 weeks of age. All of the puppies
were healthy on the basis of clinical examination, blood count, and fecal parasi-
tological examination. The puppies were fasted overmight with free access to water
prior to each ultrasound and were weighed on a digital pediatric scale. Consent
was provided by the owners of all puppies.
Mylab Five Vet echograph (Esaote, Italia), set for shallow abdominal evalua-
tion, was used with an 8-MHz microconvex transducer at 5 cm working depth and
were placed in left lateral recumbency with right paramedian retrocostal scanning
for the jejunal lymph nodes and prepubic paramedian scanning for the right medial
iliac and hypogastric nodes. The puppies were then placed in right lateral
recumbency, and the medial iliac and ipsilateral hypogastric nodes were viewed
the lymph node's long axis, and then the scan axis was rotated 90° for evaluations
of the short axis. After a careful evaluation of lymph node echogenicity and
optimization of the widest section, measurements of length, thickness, and width
(in mm) were made; the width/length ratio (w/l) was then calculated. For jejunal
lymph nodes, measurements were performed only on the largest lymph nodes.

and left lymph nodes and between the first and the second measurements. Linear
regression on body weight was performed after Student's f test on consecutive
measurements of body weight. Statistical analysis was performed by specific
software GraphPad InStat (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) with signifi-
cance limit of P< 0.05
22.3 Results
The data reported here include only the first and second evaluations, which were
all that were completed at the time of writing. The medial iliac lymph nodes
appeared iso-to hypo-echoic compared to mesenteric fat and were always easily
identifiable. They had a homogeneous appearance or a cortical-medullar structure.
Visualization was aided by their location on the abdominal aorta at the lumbar
sions at the cranial and caudal ends and narrower in the center. On cross-section,
they appeared ovoid (Fig. 22.1).
In longitudinal section, the hypogastric lymph nodes had an elongated oval
shape, and had close communication with the surrounding vessels, which served as
major landmarks. In cross-section, they appeared spherical and in line with the
iliac arteries. They were hypoechoic compared to mesenteric fat and appeared
generally homogeneous.
The jejunal lymph nodes appeared very clearly in the right paramedian scan-
ning, and were bigger than both other abdominal lymph nodes on both longitudinal
and transverse scanning. The vessels located in the middle of the same lympho-
very large lymph node-like objects were also easily identifiable. On cross-section,
they appeared oval shaped, nearly circular, iso-to hypoechoic compared to the
mesentery, and generally homogeneous. Descriptive statistics related to lymph
node size is shown in Table 22.1.
At the first evaluation, body weight was 3.48 ± 0.4 kg (mean ± S.D.); at the
second evaluation, body weight was 4.48 ± 0.7 kg. This difference in weight was

difference between the left and right lymph nodes or a correlation with weight gain.
22.4 Discussion
Ultrasonography of abdominal lymph nodes is particularly important to make a
distinction between infammatory and neoplastic reactivity, by evaluating the size,
shape, and margins of the intermal structure, as well as the vascular markings.
22Ultrasonographic Assessment of Abdominal Lymph Nodes

Ultrasound also provides a fundamental aid to needle aspiration of abdominal
lymph nodes (Nyman and O'Brien 2007). The sizes of the medial iliac and jejunal
nodes were similar to the bibliographic data obtained from adult subjects with
variable weights (Agthe et al. 2009; Mayer et al. 2010); this may be due to the
increased activity of the lymphatic stations in puppies. The statistically significant
decrease of some of the measured parameters between the evaluations suggests
that the size of the lymph nodes may be uncorrelated or inversely correlated with
the weight of the animal. We believe that the results of this survey can be
definitive only following a third evaluation. Limitations of the study are the low
number of subjects, even though they were of average constitution and serially
assessing puppies is difficult. At this time, the authors have not reported data for
subjects of small size, because the number is still too small for statistical
consideration.

Changes in the Metabolic Profile
and Performance of Dairy Cows Fed Two
Dietary Crude Protein Concentrations
D. Bernardini, S. Segato, G. Marchesini, A. L. Stefani, G. Gerardi
and I. Andrighetto
Abstract According to a 2 × 2 cross-over design, 14 lactating Holstein-Friesian
cows were fed two isofibrous and isoenergetic diets based on either 14.5 % of
crude protein (LOW CP diet) or 16.5 % (HIGH CP diet). Milk yield and quality
and metabolic profile were detected during the third week of each experimental
period. Dietary treatment had no effect on dry matter (DM) intake (21.0 kg/d on
  )        )   
average). LOW CP fed cows showed a lower milk urea content (19.4 vs. 29.7 mg/
dl; P < 0.0l). In LOW CP treatment, it was observed a significant increase of
plasma globulins, glucose, and creatinine meanwhile the urea level was significant
Jower. The efficiency of CP utilization was higher (0.39 vs. 0.34; P < 0.05) for the
LOW CP group.

utilization during the anabolic phase. Along with the environmental risk of
nitrogen pollution, excessive CP can increase milk urea concentration and have
negative consequences on the coagulation of milk (Segato et al. 2007). In dairy
cows with a milk yield up to 35 kg/day, the nitrogen content should be maintained
within 26 g/kg of dry matter (DM) (equal to 16.3 % of CP). Achieving lower
nitrogen levels is possible by feeding highly digestible forages (De Campaneneere
et al. 2006) and/or free amino acids (Cozzi et al. 2003). Along with measuring
nitrogen input and output, analysis of the metabolic profile could explain anabolic
(protein synthesis) and catabolic (urea excretion) processes involving nitrogen
(Bermardini et al. 2005), which would allow the assessment of nitrogen efficiency
in dairy cows. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of dietary protein
reduction on the productive performance and metabolic profile of dairy cows fed
with a maize silage-based total mixed ration (TMR)
23.2 Materials and Methods
According to a 2 × 2 cross-over design (2 diets × 2 periods), 14 lactating
Holstein-Friesian cows (142 ± 79 days in milk; 35.1 ± 5.3 kg/day milk pr0-
duction) were fed two isoenergetic (0.95 UFL/kg DM) and isofibrous
(31.5 % DM) diets characterized by different crude protein levels: LOW CP
(14.5 % DM) and HIGH CP (16.5 % DM). In the LOW CP diet, a part of the
soybean by-products was replaced with fine bran and maize meal supplemented
with L-Lysine and DL-methionine. For each experimental period, the metabolic
profle and milk yield and quality were analyzed after 3 weeks of adaptation. DM
intake was continuously and automatically measured (Biocontrol A/S, Rakkestad.
Norway) and blood samples were collected into heparinized tubes after the
moming milking. All metabolic parameters were determined using an automatic
of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), which were analyzed using a commercial kit
(Novatech Diagnostics, Randox). The assumption of normality of all variables was
tested before carrying out the ANOVA (Proc Mixed) according to a linear model,
which considered diet and period as main effects and cow as random effect (SAS
2002).
23.3 Results
Dietary treatment did not affect DM intake (20.9 vs. 21.1 kg/day; P > 0.10), milk
yield (35.0 vs. 34.4 kg/day; P > 0.10), or milk protein content (3.48 vs. 3.47 %;
P > 0.10). The CP ingestion was significantly lower in LOW CP-fed cows (3.02
vs. 3.42 kg/day; P < 0.05), which also resulted in more effective nitrogen eff-
ciency, expressed as the ratio between milk nitrogen and ingested nitrogen (0.39

by a lower urea concentration (19.4 vs. 29.7 mg/dL; P < 0.01). The results of the
hematological profile are reported in Table 23.1. The LOW CP diet led to a
tendency toward a higher amount of total protein, likely as a result of increased
globulins. Furthenmore, LOW CP-fed cows had significantly higher glucose and
creatinine values, while the urea level was significantly lower.
23.4 Discussion
In diets for lactating dairy cows in which protein sources are mainly soybean by-
 products, lysine, and methionine are the limiting amino acids. The supplementing
of these amino acids in the LOw CP diet likely improved its amino acid profle,
leading to an increase in nitrogen efficiency, calculated as the ratio between milk
and dietary CP percentage (Cozzi et al. 2003). However, a lower nitrogen supply,
even when supported by a lysine and methionine supplementation, caused greater
muscular protein mobilization to support milk protein synthesis. This hypothesis
was confinmed by the higher blood creatinine level, which is an indicator of higher
endogenous protein catabolism. The higher glucose levels in the LOW CP-fed
cows may be due to the lower urea content in plasma and milk resulting in less
liver fatigue needed to support urea conversion from ammonia. Even though cows
were in a mid-stage of lactation, the LOW CP diet showed greater dietary nitrogen
efficiency (Mantysaari et al. 2005). This finding is of noticeable importance for the
application of the EU Nitrates Directive, especially in vulnerable areas where there
128
D. Bernardini et al.
are more intensive dairy farms (Segato et al. 2009). In conclusion, the results of
this study confirm the possibility of reducing the amount of dietary nitrogen fed to
high producing dairy cows without reduction in perfonmance, at least after
4 months from parturition. The use of lower dietary CP is also suitable to reduce
blood and milk urea levels, leading to better cheese-making traits. It should
therefore be appropriate to further reduce dietary CP content by using high bio-
logical value protein sources and/or supplying the diet with free essential amino
acids.

Impact of Physical Exercise on Release

Abstract The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of physical
exercise on the release of cardiac troponins (cTn). Sixteen dogs were evaluated: 8
clinically healthy (group A) and 8 (group B) with valve disease in the asymp-
tomatic stage (class I, New York Heart Association). All dogs, after a complete
cardiac evaluation, were forced to exercise on a motorized treadmill at three

samples were refrigerated at -20°. cTnI and cTnT were measured just before the
running test, after a recovery period of 20 min, and then 2, 4, and 6 h later. cTnl
concentrations increased in group A only at the highest speed, while cTnT did not
change. These results suggest that exercise may induce myocardial suffering.

(Henmann et al. 2003; Vidotto et al. 2005; Shave et al. 2007; La Gerche et al.

partially explained by large variations in exercise parameters such as duration and
intensity (Vidotto et al. 2005) or evidence of underlying heart disease not
clinically manifest. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of
physical exercise on the release of cardiac troponins (cTn) in healthy and card-
iopathic dogs with valve disease in the asymptomatic stage (class I, New York
HeartAssociation).
24.2 Materials and Methods
Eight healthy dogs (group A) and eight with valve disease in the asymptomatic
stage (group B) were recruited for this study and written informed consent was
obtained from each patient's owner. The group A was represented by five
American Stafford Shire Terrier (two males and three females), two Cross-Breed
males and one Boxer female. The average age was 5.2 years. The group B (two
females and six males) included four Cross-Breed, two English Setter, one Boxer,
and one English Bulldog. The average age in group B was 8.4 years. All dogs
underwent a full cardiac investigation (history, physical examination, arterial
blood pressure measurement, full hematology, routine serum biochemistry, elec-
trocardiography, survey radiographs, and color Doppler echocardiography)
Diagnosis of valve disease and clinical staging was based on clinical findings, on
echocardiography and on radiographic examination of cardiac enlargement by
vertebral heart score (VHS) (Buchanan and Bucheler 1995). Patients were exer-
cised on a motorized treadmill (Grillo, Italy) graded at three different speeds:
1.8 km/h (low speed), 3.6 km/h (moderate speed), and 5.4 km/h (high speed) with
a prior heating phase of 3 min. The duration of each test was 6 min. A period of
7 days between the tests was allowed. A session of pre-trained was carried out as
the subjects were not familiar with the treadmill and the equipment. It was esti-
mated a resting (recovery time) of about 20 min. The test was planned to terminate
at an earlier stage (end point) if a patient showed signs of fatigue, pain, or distress
or other symptoms of intolerance. Blood samples were collected 20 min before the
test, 20 min afterwards (recovery period), and 2, 4, and 6 h after the exercise; they
were centrifuged, immediately after collection and stored at -20 °C. Serum car-
 diac troponin-I was measured using a immunochemiluminescence test (Access@
AccuTnl). Cardiac troponin-T was measured by enzyme immunoassay test
(ElecsysRoche). Levels of cTnI were below of 0.30 ng/ml (Spratt et al. 2005)
and of cTnT below 0.04 ng/ml were considered normal. Samples of plasma were
used for the assay of lactate, considered the most sensitive parameter for the
analysis performed using Student's t-tests included: comparison of the cTnI and
cTnT concentrations on pre and post exercise; the values of cTn at the end of
exercise at different speeds. Data are expressed as means with the corresponding
standard deviations.

24.3 Results
Before exercise, lactate levels (mean ± S.D.) were within the reference ranges for
both groups (0.87 ± 0.32; references range 0.40-1.40 mmol/L); at the higher
speeds (3.6 and 5.4 km/h) recovery levels were 2.8 ± 0.44 mmol/L. The concen-
trations of cTnI (mean ± S.D.) in the pre-exercise were within the reference ranges
in both groups (1.8 ± 0.006 and 2.4 ± 0.007 ng/ml, in groups A and B, respec-
tively). Already 2 h after the end of the exercise, it showed a statistically sigmificant
increase (p = 0.011) of cTnI at higher speeds (mean 0.093 ± 0.02 ng/ml at
3.6 km/h; mean 0.1 ± 0.02 ng/ml at 5.4 km/h) in group B. No significant increase
(p = 0.174) was found at the slowest speed (walk, 1.8 km/h, mean of cTnI
0.035 ± 0.01 ng/ml) (Fig. 24.1). Increased values of cTnI showed at 2 h after end
of test remained higher at 4 and 6 h. The increase of plasma concentrations of
troponins post-exercise compared between the two groups at speed 3.6 and 5.4 km/
h was significant (p = 0.022; p = 0.014). Changes of cTnT (mean pre-exercise
0.014 ± 0.07 ng/ml; mean post-exercise 0.012 ± 0.06 ng/ml) were not statistical
significant.
24.4 Discussion
In human medicine, exercise testing (ET) is considered as a practical method,
which provides to give important informations about the stage of heart failure. It is
useful to formulate a accurate prognosis. The test is based on the response to
physical effort by the subjective perception of fatigue, electrocardiographic
monitoring, and blood pressure measure (Lainchbury and Richards 2002). The
feasibility of ET in patients with congestive heart failure has been investigated in
dogs by Kittleson et al. (1996), using submaximal test and measurements of lactate
threshold and venous oxygen tension. More recently, Boddy et al. (2004) evaluated
the suitability of the 6 min walk test in dogs. However, although the 6 min walk

test is simple, it is not based on a full objective evaluation. Indeed, several ele-
ments may affect the distance walked in 6 min by a dog, such as the pace of the
person walking the dog or the presence of distracting stimuli such as people,
animals, or noise in the surrounding environment. One of the primary problems
encountered by Kittleson and collegues was the unwillingness of approximately
50 % of the dogs to walk on a treadmill. In our study, none of the patients
appeared reluctant umdergo the test, probably because the owners were allowed to
walk on the treadmill with their dogs.
The increased level of lactate above the physiological ranges suggested that all
dogs were subjected to a submaximal physical effort. The failure to increase levels
of cTn in subjects of the control group is partially in agreement with those reported
in humans and in the horse: cTnI does not undergo significant changes during
Unlike the significant increase of cTnI in patients of group B (asymptomatic
subjects with valve disease) occurred at higher speeds where suggested that
exercise may induce myocardial suffering, evidenced by the increase of these
values. The significant increase of cTnI if not exceeding the references range for
the dog may indicate the presence of a myocardial insult mild and of short
duration, such as not to exceed the physiological threshold of cTnI. The release of
cTnI could be related to the increase in myocardial work and to higher demand of
oxygen or as consequence of oxidative stress triggered in patients by with valve
dysfunction by various factors, such as wall stress, spasm coronary artery, and
ischemia. Although in our case, the increase in cTnI during treadmill exercise in
subjects on class I New York Heart Association (NYHA) was not associated with
indicator of exercise tolerability. In human patients, it has been demonstrated that
myocardial damage (Schober et al. 2002).
A similar peak was observed with serum troponin-I in rats after a prolonged and
intense. Our study has shown that concentrations of cTnI were raised 2 h after the
end of exercise test and remained increased in hours later. The lack of variation of
cTnT in control group would seem to be connected to a diagnostic sensitivity of
cTnI greater than the cTnT, which seems to have a greater prognostic value
(Schober et al. 2002). In conclusion, our study suggests that intensity and duration
of exercise can lead to myocardial suffering, undetectable except through objective
parameters such as the measurement of cTnI.

objective characterization of erythrocyte morphology, e.g., anisocytosis, represent
only an average of all the erythrocytes in the sample. Erythrocyte morphologic
e valuation of a well-prepared blood smear performed by an expert microscopist at
the optical microscope (OM) provides insight into the etiologies of anemia, the
presence of underlying metabolic processes, the possibility of underlying specific
organ dysfunction, and identification of infectious agents (Harvey 2001; De Nicola
2008; Walker 2008). The aim of this study was to describe the presence of a new
canine blood smears examined with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). To
understand the meaning of this morphological alteration, the possible correlation
with signalment and other hemato-biochemical parameters was also investigated.
25.2 Materials and Methods
We evaluated 3,958 canine CBCs, which were selected between May 2009 and
October 20l0. All of the blood samples were collected in ethylenediaminetetra-
acetic acid (EDTA) tubes containing the correct anticoagulant-blood ratio. The
samples were analyzed with a veterinary impedance cell counter HeCoVet (SEAC.
Calenzano, FI, Italia) within 3 h after collection. Blood smears, which were
stained with Diff-Quick?, were also prepared within 3 h after collection. Smears
were viewed with an OM at 20x magnification to evaluate cell distribution and to
perform the platelet count. A magnification of 100x was used to evaluate eryth-
rocyte morphology (e.g., anisocytosis, polychromasia, poikilocytosis, and rouleaux
formation), leukocyte and platelet morphology and to perform the differential
rocytes were observed were statistically compared with a control population
smears examined with the SEM were initially fixed in methanol and viewed with

smears were prepared, without dehydration, for the SEM (JEOL JSM-5410) by the
Inter-Departmental Microscopy Centre, and were processed with gold staining.
The following tests were used for the statistical analysis: Fisher's Exact test was
used for the breed analysis, the Chi-squared test was used for the sex and age
analysis, and the ANOVA test was used to compare CBC parameters, biochemical
profiles, and serum protein electrophoresis results.
25.3Results
The “quatrefoil" erythrocyte pattem was found during blood smear evaluation,
generally in the central portion of the smear, between the body and feathered edge.
These erythrocytes were isolated or occurred with other RBC modifications. In the
25CanineErythrocyteMorphology
137
central portion of the smear, there were minimal distortions and slide preparation
artifacts. Approximately 50 % of the RBCs were barely touching each other
(Figs. 25.1 and 25.2). The prevalence of the “quatrefoil" RBC morphology was
3.89 % (154/3,958).
With regard to breed, the “quatrefoil" RBC patterm was observed in mixed
  (% 811 1 = u) s 7 ( 6  = u) s
herds (n = 11; 7.2 %), Golden Retrievers (n = 8; 5.2 %), Poodles, Rottweilers,
(% 8 =u) sao u (%9  = u) saxo (%  = ) oa s
(Fisher's Exact test; p > 0.05). The Chi-squared analysis was not statistically
significant with regard to sex (p > 0.05) (n = 81 males, 52.6 % and n = 73
females, 47.4 %). Dogs with “quatrefoil" RBCs were split in three age groups:
puppy (0-12 months, n = 27 dogs), adults (13 months-6 years, n = 42 dogs), and
old (≥7 years old, n = 85 dogs). Compared with the control population, the Chi-
square analysis revealed an increased frequency of “quatrefoil" RBCs in older
dogs (p < 0.0001). In dogs with “quatrefoil" RBCs, the following alterations were
also observed (prevalence in the control population in brackets): anisocytosis (+1/
s (% 19) % 19 (+) s % 19) % 10 (+
22.7 % (20.1 %); rouleaux formation, 9 % (14.5 %); dacryocytes, 9 % (6.4 %);
elliptocytes, 7.8 % (6.1 %); acanthocytes, 3.9 % (3.9 %); schistocytes, 3.2 %
(4.5 %); eccentrocytes, 2.3 % (1.2 %); keratocytes, 2.3 % (2.1 %); and target cells
and spherocytes, 1.3 % (0.7 %), Howell-Jolly bodies, 19.4 % (11.6 %). None of
these changes were significantly associated (ANOVA test) with the appearance of
“quatrefoil" RBCs.
The ANOVA test performed on CBCs, biochemical profles and serum protein
electrophoresis parameters revealed that leukocyte counts (absolute) and neutrophil
trefoil" RBC populations than in the control population.
25.4 Discussion
This study is the frst to describe the prevalence of these various erythrocyte alter-
ations. The occurrence of “quatrefoil" RBCs is quite rare, about 4 % (154/3,958
dogs). They have been observed more frequently in older dogs, with no differences
between breed or sex. These dogs also exhibited more RBC changes (i.e., higher

significant (p > 0.05). Compared with the control population, “quatrefoil" RBCs
were more frequently found in dogs with lower leukocyte and neutrophil counts.
One hypothesis that explains the formation of “quatrefoil" RBCs describes them as
 EDTA-induced artifacts. Another hypothesis is that dacryocytes overlap with other
erythrocytes at the feathered edge of the blood smear. Upon further observation, this
 quency in the area between the body of the smear and the feathered edge. In addition,
intermediate forms often exhibited round cell characteristics, which were different
from dacryocytes. Rouleaux formation was less frequent in dogs with “quatrefoil"
RBCs, and thus does not explain the cause of this cell patterm. SEM examination of
cell morphology changes confirmed the presence of the “quatrefoil" patterm in blood
smears, which disproves the hypothesis of an optical illusion or accidental finding.
Furthermore, the SEM analysis provided a basis for a 3-D model. The “quatrefoil'
erythrocytes, examined with higher magnification compared to the optical micros
copy, displayed an “embraced" cell formation (Fig. 25.3). This patterm is different
ment seen with agglutinated RBCs
A second hypothesis was that this patterm was an unusual circulating cell.
Cellular adhesion is a fascinating and difficult to investigate process. Blood cir-
could lead to adhesion. These interactions can be infuenced by electrostatic, steric,
hydration, Van der Waals, and specific chemical bonding forces. Adhesion is
inversely related to the surface tension of erythrocytes’ suspension, but it is
directly related to viscosity. The surface tension is related to the number of
adhesion molecules, most of which are proteins attached to the cytoskeleton
(Barshtein et al. 2000; Elblbesy et al. 2009). The extent of this aggregation is

determined by opposing forces; from one side the presence of macromolecules and
from the other side superficial negative charge and shear stress. The RBC consists,
from a physical point of view, of an outer flexible cell membrane and inner viscous
fuid and its deformation derives from the membrane elastic properties together
with a high surface-volume ratio. Experimental observations of erythrocytes in
shear fows demonstrate two types of movement. One type is “tank-treading", a
rotation of the membrane around the viscous core of the erythrocyte that maintains
a constant shape. The other type is “tumbling" an overall rotation of the entire cell
as a rigid body. If fuid extermal force is greater than membrane elastic resistance
force, the membrane maintains its tank-treading movement. Otherwise the motion
changes to tumbling. When the maximum elastic resistance force is comparable to
the extemal fuid force there is a transition between the two kinds of movement,
that is, an oscillation of the RBC accompanied by membrane rotation (Tsubota
et al. 20l0). The “quatrefoil" pattem could be a particular type of adhesion
between two RBCs into a relatively small area of contact, together with the
infuence of shear fow forces and tank-treading motions which may lead to a
slipping effect between two RBC membranes, and consequently cell deformation
through the loss of biconcavity. The end result is an “embraced shape". Causes of
adhesion could be related to the production of molecules from the immune system
(infammation and immune-mediated phenomena) and increased turbulence in
damaged vascular beds. Altermatively, ineffective erythrocatheresis and a longer
life span of circulating erythrocytes (e.g, in older animals) may contribute to
increased adhesion. More data are required to understand the mechanism of this
RBC morphological alteration.
A large number of dogs with more detailed clinical data about health status may
produce the data needed to correlate “quatrefoil" RBCs with a specific disorder or
a group of diseases (e.g., infammatory, neoplastic, or degenerative).

Pain Management in Companion
Animals: Medical-Legal Aspects
V. Quartarone, A. Fazio, G. della Rocca, M. Russo and A. Passantino
Abstract Preventing and managing pain has become a fundamental part of
quality and compassionate patient care in veterinary medicine. In fact, animal pain
and suffering are clinically important conditions that adversely affect an animal's
quality of life. Methods to prevent and control pain must be tailored to the indi-
vidual animal. As advocates for their patients, the veterinary team has the
responsibility to recognize, assess, prevent, and treat pain. Considering that many
dogs and cats still receive little or not analgesia following surgery, trauma, or
disease, we suggest the development of guidelines on pain management to assist
the veterinarian in optimizing comfort care

26.1 Introduction
Pain control is an important issue, which in recent years has been given particular
attention. The Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of Perugia University established
the Study Center on Animal Pain (CeSDA) to “homogenize and coordinate sci-
entific, cultural, and educational initiatives in the feld of problems related to
animal pain' (https://centri.unipg.it/cesda/).
Successful diagnostic and therapeutic interventions aimed at detecting the
presence of pain and implementing appropriate analgesic therapies require
excellent knowledge of the pathophysiology of pain, the clinical consequences of
inadequately treated pain, the kinetics and dynamics of analgesic drugs available,
and of additional therapeutic options.
The veterinarian must recognize the presence of pain and its location, intensity,
type, and pathogenesis, and implement a treatment plan specifically adapted for each
patient. Choice and conduct of the treatment are the sole responsibility of the vet-
erinarian, who makes decisions according to the clinical evaluation of the patient.
Pain therapy is one of the branches of medicine in which biological phenomena
can also be examined from the aspect of ethics (res medica sub specie iuris). In
veterinary medicine, there are no legal references on the issue, so the veterinarian
is forced to refer to human regulations. A variety of practical and legal limits often
lead to an underestimation by the veterinarian of the problem of pain and of its
treatment. Consequently, we need guidelines that allow veterinarians to evaluate
the different scientifically validated treatment options available, taking into
account all aspects of patient care, quality of animal life, and compliance, with a
proper veterinary-client-patient relationship.
26.2 Limits of Treatment of Pain in Animals
After recent scientific advances, pain is no longer considered just a symptom. It is
a symptom of tissue damage, where it plays a biological role of protection (acute,
physiological, and inflammatory pain), but it is also a pathology itself where, once
the initial damage has been repaired, or in the absence of a lesion, it is still present
(chronic and pathological pain).
The transition from acute to chronic pain is due to the establishment in the
nervous system of a series of morphological and functional changes that explain
the pain, even in the absence of afferent stimulation.
A characteristic of chronic pain is a lesser or complete lack of response to
analgesic drugs normally used in acute pain, though it may eventually respond to
other classes of drugs. It becomes necessary to go back to the pathogenesis of the
pain occurring at the time of the diagnosis, thus defining the type. This is not
always easy, especially given the fact that pain is a dynamic event that tends to
change over time, with different and complex pathogenic mechanisms.
26 Pain Management in Companion Animals
143
It can be diffcult to recognize the presence of pain in animals. They cannot
verbalize, and at present there are no objective methods to demonstrate and
quantify the presence of pain. Changes in physiological, metabolic, and neuro-
endocrine parameters are not just indicative of pain but are also associated with
anxiety and stress. In veterinary medicine, it is preferable to assess behavioral
responses to pain. It requires a good knowledge of the behavioral repertoire of the
species, as well as the individual, in response to pain. In particular, the relief of
abnormal behavior patterms is considered particularly useful and meaningful in this
may have, following a surgery or a disease, and to apply “pain scales." These
systems all have limits and it is often necessary to apply various diagnostic
 methods in combination, as part of a careful clinical evaluation of the patient.
Analgesic therapy cannot be predetermined, but must be adapted to the type of
pain, the animal species, the individual response to the drug, and to the health
status of the patient. In addition to the classes of analgesics commonly used to
combat acute pain (opioids, NSAIDs, local anesthetics, β2-agonists, and trama-
dol), we must also consider other molecules (ketamine, anticonvulsants,
antidepressants, GABA-mimetics, etc.), and nonpharmacological approaches (e.g..
combined as part of a multimodal analgesic protocol.
Medication side effects and drug interactions have to be taken into account,
while remembering that the clinical consequences of pain, whether acute or
chronic, are still often more severe than complications due to treatments
26.3 Medical-Legal Considerations
In recent years, animals have been assigned important emotional, social, and
supportive roles and this has allowed the conception of an animal as “res" (Article
812 of Italian Civil Code) (Passantino 2008) and the recognition, even from a legal
point of view, of its nature as alive, sentient, and able to experience suffering and
pain (EC 2007).
For this reason, many researchers studied animals' sensitivity and ability to feel
pain (Bianchi et al. 2003; della Rocca and Di Salvo 2008; della Rocca et al. 2009).
Such studies have shown that animals feel pain, as they have all of the anatomic
and functional components necessary for the perception of painful stimuli as both
reflex stimuli and conscious stimuli. It was also shown that fish are sentient and are
capable of feeling pain (Algers et al. 2009). In some fish species, two types of
nociceptors (A-delta and C) were identified to be responsible for the transduction
         
Hastein 2008; Sneddon 2002; Sneddon et al. 2003). The sensitivity of pet owners
to the suffering of their animals has inspired progress in this area, putting pain
control at the forefront of “compassionate care" (della Rocca and Di Salvo 2008;
Ogilvie 2004). The treatment of pain should be an integral and inalienable part of
144
V. Quartarone et al.
the therapeutic process in the animal patient as it is in the human patient, and must
take into consideration the value and the dignity of the animal.
There is no community or national legislation defining proper conduct of the
veterinarian in the treatment of pain in animals or providing guidelines regarding
the diagnosis or treatment of pain.
At present, the only legal regulations related to pain therapy, concerming nar-
cotic drugs and their storage, are in reference to humans (Anon 1990, 2001, 2006).
Moreover, our country has recently issued a regulation (Anon 2010) relating to
       n     
report pain level (Article 7 of Law no. 38/2010), the applied analgesic technique,
drugs used, dosages, and the obtained results in the patient's medical records. This
regulation also considers the simplification of prescribing drugs for pain relief
(Article 10 of Law no. 38/2010).
The same has not been determined for veterinary medicine. These deficiencies
are reflected in clinical practice, where pain management is often superficial or
lacking.
It is, therefore, necessary for the legislation to at least propose a measure aimed
at regulating the use of analgesic drugs in veterinary medicine. It would also be
desirable to formulate guidelines on the minimum requirements in the practice of
pain management, which would aim to standardize medical conduct. These rec-
ommendations could be met, modifed, or rejected depending on the clinical or
surgical needs of the animal patient, but each case would be supported by an
updated tool, utilizing data from the current literature, and the synthesis of expert
opinion and clinical practice.
In the absence of a legal act, the veterinarian must always make choices
respecting the life and health of the patient, and evaluating the relationship
between costs and benefits, as determined by the code of ethics. It is, therefore,
important to keep the animal's life free of pain and stress as much as possible. This
appropriate knowledge to prevent and stop suffering.

Increase of TVBN and TMA-N in Skin
and Gills of Sparus aurata During Storage
A. Giuffrida, F. Giarratana, D. Signorino, G. Ziino
and A. Panebianco
Abstract The aim of this work was to assess the increase of total volatile basic
nitrogen (TVBN) and trimethylamine nitrogen (TMA-N) in the skin, gills and
muscle of gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) during refrigerated storage and to
relate these increases to sensorial scores and spoilage bacteria growth. TVBN and
TMA-N increases in skin and gills were more correlated to the sensorial scores
obtained by the quality index method and to bacterial growth, in comparison to
TVBN and TMA-N of muscle. Since the bacterial load of muscle is very low until
the 168th hour of storage, according to the obtained results, measurement of
TVBN and TMA-N of skin and gills could prove useful for the assessment of the
shelf life of gilthead seabream.

27.1 Introduction
The shelf life of fish is due to several intrinsic and extrinsic factors that can
infuence enzyme activity and the behaviour of spoilage bacteria. Some authors
(Gram and Dalgaard 2002) have emphasised the importance of certain bacteria
called specific spoilage organisms (SSO), including Pseudomonas spp., Shewa-
nella putrefaciens and Photobacterium phosphoreum, which are able to exploit
specific metabolites of fish muscle for their growth. Particularly, these bacteria are
able to reduce trimethylamine oxide (TMA-O) into trimethylamine nitrogen
(TMA-N), which causes the specific odour of spoiled fish. The increase of total

volatile basic nitrogen (TVBN) during fish storage is related to the activity of SSO
against muscle proteins and for this reason TVBN is considered as a good indicator
of fish spoilage, especially for certain species.
Several studies have been carried out to assess the relationships between SSO
behaviour, sensorial parameters and chemical indicators such as TMA-N and
TVBN, especially for species widely exploited in aquaculture as Sparus aurata
(Giuffrida et al. 2005; Huidobro et al. 2000; Koutsoumanis and Nychas 2000;
Lougovois et al. 2003; Marrone et al. 2007). In this species, however, the increase
of TVBN and TMA-N during refrigerated storage did not always correlate to
sensorial decay (quality index method, QIM and score) or to the growth of SSO. It
is well-known that the bacterial load of fish muscle can be very low for several
bream. Conversely, skin and gills normally have a high bacterial load that affects
sensorial parameters early. These aspects could explain the low correlation
between muscle chemical indicators and sensorial or microbiological parameters.
Thus, the aim of this work was to study the increase of TVBN and TMA-N in the
skin and gills of specimens of Sparnus aurata during refrigerated storage, and at the
same time to evaluate the relationship between these chemical indicators, spoilage
fora and the QIM scores.
27.2 Materials and Methods
This study was carried out using 21 specimens of Spanus aurata obtained from a
Sicilian aquaculture plant. Fish, after harvest, were freighted to the laboratory
within 2 h and submitted to analytical and sensorial evaluation. The former was
carried out after 0, 120, 168, 216 and 288 h of storage at 6 °C and included the
sterile sampling of gills, skin and muscle from three specimens. These samples
were cultured onto Levine Iron Agar at 25 °C for 72 h, after 10-fold dilutions in
peptone water. An aliquot of each subsample was used for the determination of
TVBN and TMA-N by the microdiffusion method in Conway cells, according to
Mahmud et al. (2007). The sensorial evaluation was carried out at the same time
intervals using the quality index method (Huidobro et al. 2000). Microbial,
27.3 Results
Figure 27.1a shows the spoilage bacteria trends on skin, gills and muscle during
storage. Of note is the quick growth on skin and gills and the slight growth in
 muscle until the end of storage, when the fish were considered completely spoiled.
The partial (QIMskin-eye, QIMgills and QIMmuscle) and total scores of QIM
(Fig. 27.1b) appear in agreement to the bacterial trends, showing a rejection

27.4 Discussion
These results confirm the low significance of muscle TVBN and TMA-N values to
assess the shelf life of gilthead seabream, according to Koutsoumanis and Nychas
(2000) and Marrone et al. (2007). Conversely, these chemical indicators on gills
and skin could be useful as their increase appeared correlated to the storage
duration. These aspects could be due to the high level of bacterial contamination in
these sites, and at the same time to the accumulation on skin and gills of several
tigations, especially in order to utilise a more correct application of Regulations
853/2003 and 2074/2005 EC concerming the use of these chemical indicators.

the myofbrillar structure. This limited proteolysis may be associated with the
inaccessibility of the actin molecule to proteolytic enzymes.

28.1 Introduction
The production of dry-cured ham requires a long processing time and is associated
with intense proteolytic activity on the myofbrillar as well as on the sarcoplasmic
proteins, resulting in their progressive degradation. Due to their low stability, the
cytosolic endopeptidases, calpains, poorly contribute to protein degradation
ally decrease throughout processing (Toldra and Etherington 1988). A residual
activity of only 5-10 % for cathepsins B, H, and L has been reported at 15 months
of processing (Toldra et al. 1993). The initial breakdown of muscle proteins by
endopeptidases is followed by the action of exopeptidases, giving rise to small
peptides and free amino acids. These final products can contribute directly or

indirectly, as precursors of other compounds (keto acids, amines, aldehydes,
methyl ketones, etc.), to favor development in dry-cured ham (Hinrichsen and
Pedersen 1994). On the other hand, excessive proteolysis could be responsible for
the appearance of defects (softness and bitter favor) and might be avoided by
removing raw materials with high proteolytic activity, as suggested for Parma ham
(Schivazappa et al. 2002). Structural modifications also associated with proteolysis
 are essential in determining the typical texture of dry-cured ham and contributing
to flavor perception (Larrea et al. 2007).
A number of studies have been published on the use of nonprotein nitrogen
fraction as an indicator of dry-cured ham proteolysis. More recently, proteomics
has been used to study the evolution of myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic protein
hydrolysis (Di Luccia et al. 2005; Picariello et al. 2006). This latter approach is
useful for identifying molecular markers to predict and discriminate quality
characteristics. In a recent proteomic study on Slovenian dry-cured hams (Kraski
prsut) (Skrlep et al. 20l1), the sensory defects found were related to the degra-
dation pattems of proteins, including actin.
This study aimed to investigate the degradation of actin during processing of
San Daniele dry-cured ham, providing a characterization of the process with
respect to myofbrillar protein fragmentation, which could infuence the fnal
sensory characteristics.
28.2 Materials and Methods
Hams were obtained from Large White × Landrace pigs, suitable for the protected
designation of origin (PDO) Prosciutto di San Daniele. The intermal Biceps femoris
muscles, characterized by low salt penetration, were excised from the hams and
analyzed at crucial steps of the ham-curing process (Tl = out of salting,
14-18 days; T2 = introduction to resting, 35 days; T3 = after washing and dry-
ing, 117 days; T4 = after greasing, 211-221 days; T5 = end of curing, 413 days).
The protein extraction was carried out in a sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)
solution containing 100 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) to optimize protein recovery.
Extracts were analyzed using one-dimensional denaturing electrophoresis (SDS-
PAGE) for the separation of proteins between 10 and 100 kDa. Westerm blotting
was then run with anti-actin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) and immunoreactive bands
were detected by chemiluminescence.
28.3 Results
In all samples, the presence of intact actin with an apparent molecular weight of
42 kDa was observed. Dry-cured ham processing gave rise to a limited degrada-
tion of this myofbrillar protein. From the drying phase, fragments around 29 and
28 Actin Proteolysis in San Daniele Dry-Cured Ham

22 kDa were detected using anti-actin antibody. After 210-220 days, a new
fragment of 38 kDa appeared and remained intact to the end of the curing, along
with the 29- and 22-kDa fragments
28.4 Discussion
Despite the number of papers published on dry-cured ham proteolysis, the research
restricted to the first 6 months of the Italian dry-cured ham process. Actin then
seemed to disappear after 10 months of processing (Di Luccia et al. 2005). Such a
complete hydrolysis of actin was not observed in Spanish dry-cured hams (Teruel),
where actin appeared to decrease less in the Semimembranosus muscle than in the
Biceps femoris (Larrea et al. 2006). Small (1502-1971 Da) peptide fragments of
actin have been identifed at the end of Serrano dry-cured ham processing, sup-
porting the relevance of action of cathepsin D (Sentandreu et al. 2007). Cathepsin
D may remain active during a large part of the processing period, although a
reduction is expected with increasing NaCl concentrations (Sarraga et al. 1993).
We hypothesize that actin degradation in San Daniele ham, which seems to be
  a    s    
may occur because of weaker myofibrillar-protein electrostatic interactions
cessing. This would explain the lag between the salting step and the appearance of
proteolytic fragments, which are probably generated by cathepsin activities.

The Donkey Milk Food Chain: Quality
and Certification
Stefano Simonella, Cristina Panetta and Biagina Chiofalo
Abstract Donkey milk, which is used for its nutritional and sensory character-
istics and for its high digestibility, is very similar to human milk, representing a
good substitute for infants affected by cow milk protein allergy. The aim of this
study was to support a farm oriented in the production of donkey milk to develop a
technical discipline (TD) for the certification of conformity (CC). The achieve-
ment of the CC, guaranteeing that any procedures related to the food in each link
of the supply chain are in full compliance with the requirements of the TD, was an
important goal to protect consumers that, in this case, are infants. This study has
permission to obtain, for the first time in Italy, certified donkey raw milk with
technical, scientific, economic, and social implications. The CC is viewed as
necessary for the effective regulation of food quality and safety throughout the
contemporary agrifood system.

Donkey milk, which is used for its nutritional and sensory characteristics (Chiofalo

protein allergy. Nevertheless, the use of donkey milk for therapeutic purposes is
hampered by several factors: difficulties in food security, ensuring supply conti-
nuity, and the medical and legal risks associated with the administration of a
nonconventional diet therapy. EC Regulation 853/2004b does not integrate gap
legislation for feeding use and marketing of donkey milk, although it can be
considered a good starting point. In this legislative situation, the adoption of
voluntary certification systems for product guarantees of food safety and quality
throughout the global supply chain is important. In recent years, the issue of food
security has assumed a significant central role, even in the Italian food system, a
crucial sector for the economy, to direct the efforts of farmers and agribusiness
toward achieving higher standards. Consequently, food security is configured as a
requirement to be pursued, rather than a prerequisite; for this reason, consumer
protection should be guaranteed, and therefore should be ensured not only through
compliance with applicable law but also through voluntary, accredited certifica-
tion. Certification of the food system offers several advantages, including
increasing the value of the special characteristics of the product or of the process
through which it is obtained; guarantee of sensory and nutritional characteristics of
the product, and its quality and uniqueness (traceability in food chains); greater
attention to sanitary aspects of food than is required by law to assure food safety;
and promotion of the image of the company and product so as to yield a com-
petitive advantage for the producer in the markets. In this context, the aim of the
present study was to support a farm oriented in the production of donkey milk to
develop a technical discipline (TD) that specifies the requirements for the regu-
lation of food safety and quality practices. The implementation of good practices is
an essential part of the agrifood system to obtain a certification of conformity (CC)
for the food product.
29.2 Materials and Methods
The study was carried out at the ASILAT Srl farm in Milo (Catania province),
which covers approximately 4 ha, with a herd consisting of about 80 donkeys
belonging to the Ragusana, Siciliana, and Pantesca populations. The farm obtained
EC Regulation 852/2004a. Breeding is based on the principles of animal welfare
assurance (Passantino 2007) and the hygienic production of milk. Feeding rations
differ in relation to their physiological phases: lactation, dry, and foals (Chiofalo
2008). Foodstuffs are given three times per day in a manger; animals have access
to fresh water ad libitum. Housing allows the movement of animals in a non-
traumatic way and without the use of electrical or other systems. The foals are with
the dams and fed directly by the udder, and are not moved from the dams for the
first 30 days of life; consequently, during this period, the dams are never milked.
The dams are milked by machine, and the foals are physically separated from the
dams for 3-5 h before each milking. even if they remain in direct visual contact

(D'Alessandro and Martemucci 2007). The pilot milking machine consists of a
type of wheeled trolley with a sheep cluster; according to a study on dairy don-
keys, operative parameters were established at 35 kPa vacuum and 50 % pulsation
ratio, with a pulsation rate at 60 cycles/min (Salimei et al. 2006; Fantuz et al.
2007). The farm also has a milking parlor with six workstations. The product of
ASILAT is raw milk, which is obtained no more than once a day, kept at a
temperature not higher than +6 °C and sold directly to the consumer. In this study,
the first step was to develop a TD based on the specific characteristics of the farm
by setting certifiable requirements for the quality practices of the breeding system
and for the food safety of the product. Subsequently, the farm was accompanied
and supported in the application of the TD. To establish certifiable criteria and
limits of the composition and hygienic (sanitary) characteristics of the product, and
to develop standards for food safety management systems to obtain raw donkey
milk of high quality, the principal aspects for drafting of the TD for the CC were as
follows: characterization of the product; identification and traceability of animals
and animal products; control plans; and staff training. For this purpose, monthly
(following the TD and self-assessments at the farm), bulk samples (approximately
50 mL) were taken directly from the cooling tank (T = +4 °C) and placed in
sterile containers. Samples were then transported, under isothenmal conditions, to
laboratories for microbiological, physical, and chemical analyses.
29.3Results
Based on the results of the analyzed samples and those reported in the literature on
raw milk (Chiofalo et al. 2004; Conte and Passantino 2008; Salimei et al. 2004),
the ranges of the physical, chemical, and microbiological parameters were defined
and reported in the TD to obtain the CC. When a draft of the TD was completed,
the ASILAT farm was supported in the application of disciplinary procedures.
helping the quality manager of the farm in the preparation of the required docu-
mentation. Therefore, the fanm was assisted in the achievement of the parameters
indicated in the TD. Among the results of the physical, chemical, and microbio-
logical parameters recorded in the analyzed samples, the total bacteria count

showed that this value is acceptable in milk of other animal species, but it seems
very high and not suitable for donkey milk, especially when this milk is used for
highly sensitive patients such as infants. In fact, the value set out in the TD was
fixed by taking into account both the positive activity of lysozyme on the microbial
status of donkey milk (Conte et al. 2006) and the people to whom the milk is
recommended (Chiofalo et al. 2006). To reduce the TBC, particular attention was
focused on all operations prior to the milking (rinsing, cleaning, and disinfection of
162

the milking machine and storage tank) and during the milking. After corrective
actions were taken, the results concerming the TBC were in line with those reported
in the TD, confirming the importance of the adoption of routine operations for milk
hygiene.
29.4 Discussion
To obtain the CC for raw donkey milk, the CoRFilCami-GCC, the certification
accredited by the Italian National Accreditation Body, was instructed to verify the
compliance of the milk with the specifications in the TD. The certification body.
after conducting pre-assessments, a documentation review of the supplier's
facilities and production operations, field audits, and verification of the confor-
mity, issued the CC, allowing the supplier to label its product as certified. The
label shows the mark of conformity and the logo of the third-party certifier. The

conclusion, this study has permitted a farm to obtain, for the first time in Italy,
certified raw donkey milk, with technical, scientific, economic, and social impli
cations. The CC is viewed as necessary for the effective regulation of food quality
and safety throughout the contemporary agrifood system. Producers that are cer-

Effect of Different Rates of Postmortem
pH Decline on the Technological Quality
of Calabrian Capocollo
L. Nanni Costa, F. Tassone, S. Dall'Olio, S. Carpino and V. Russo
Abstract Ninety carcasses from cross-bred pigs [Duroc × (Landrace × Large
White)] were examined to study the effect of postmortem acidification rate on
weight loss during the processing of protected designation of origin Calabrian
Capocollo. The pH was measured in the loin at the 6th rib at 1, 3, and 6 h
postmortem. Thirty-four carcasses were selected on the basis of pH decline at 3 h:
slow (pH, > 6.20, n = 11), intermediate (5.91 > pH, ≤ 6.20, n = 11), and fast
(pH ≤ 5.90, n = 12). Before and after curing and ripening, the Capocollo
weights were recorded and the respective losses (%) were calculated. At 1, 3, and
7 days postmortem, measurements of pH, color, and water holding capacity
(WHC) were recorded from adjacent loin samples. Fast acidification was associ-
ated with a lighter color and lower WHC of fresh meat but did not affect weight

wall. The cut is then tied with natural twine, and the wrapping is perforated. To
limit the development of microbial fora and to facilitate slow ripening, aging takes
place in temperature and humidity controlled rooms for not fewer than 100 days
after salting. The Calabrian Capocollo consists of a single whole piece of meat.
Therefore, the quality of the raw material can influence weight loss during pro-
cessing. The aim of this study was to evaluate the infuence of the rate of post-
mortem pH decline on fresh meat quality and on weight loss during Capocollo
processing in order to characterize the raw meat for the attitude to the production
of this PDO salami.
30.2 Materials and Methods
The carcasses of 90 cross-bred pigs [Duroc × (Landrace × Large White)], which
were reared in the province of Reggio Calabria, were examined. Pigs were
             
Cosenza. After electrical stunning (220 V, 0.9 Amp), pigs were eviscerated and
hot carcass weight was recorded. At 1, 3, and 6 h postmortem, the pH of the
longissimus thoracis muscle at the level of the sixth thoracic vertebra was mea-
sured on left half-carcasses. On the basis of pH measured at 3 h postmortem,
36 half carcasses were selected. At dissection, the number of carcasses was
reduced to 34 due to blood splashing in the loin. The 34 half carcasses were
divided into three  groups; slow (pH, > 6.20,  n = 11), intenmediate
(5.91 > pH ≤ 6.20, n = 11), and fast (n = 12, pH, ≤ 5.90) pH decline. Capo-
collo was isolated from the half carcasses, then immediately deboned and trim-
med. An adjacent sample was collected from between the 6th and the 10th thoracic
vertebrae for the color measurement (Minolta CRC300, L*, a*, b* system) at 6 h
ported by air to a Department laboratory. The pH, color, and cooking losses
(Honikel 1998) were measured at 1, 3, and 7 days postmortem. Drip losses
(Honikel 1998) were assessed at 3 days postmortem. After weighing, the Capocolli
were subjected to two dry saltings, each 4 days in length. A mixture of salt,
favorings, and additives equal to 2 % and to 1 % of the batch weight were added
at the first and second saltings, respectively. The Capocolli samples were weighed
at the end of the second salting and after 98 days ripening. Weight losses after
salting and ripening were calculated on Capocolli weight recorded before the first
salting. Data were analyzed using the SAS mixed procedure (SAS 1996). For the
analysis, pH decline was a fixed factor and subject was a random factor. The
mixed repeated measures analysis procedure was used to analyze the parameters at
different times postmortem.

30.3 Results
Because of the high carcass weights (mean ± SD, 148.8 ± 16.1 kg), the Capo-
colli raw weight was higher than normal, but within the 3.5-5.5 kg range required
by the original regulation and subsequent amendments. The average weight
(mean ± SD) was 5.08 ± 0.40 kg after trimming, 4.98 ± 0.39 kg after salting,
and 2.83 ± 0.35 kg after drying. Table 30.1 lists the postmortem change in pH
 and the L* color coordinate. The weights recorded in these processing steps were
 not significantly different between the groups with different rates of pH decline
(P > 0.05). At 3 h postmortem, the pH was significantly different between the
three groups. However, for subsequent measurements, only the differences
between slow and fast pH decline groups reached the threshold of statistical sig-
nificance. In addition, the pH values of groups with fast and slow pH decline were
far from the thresholds which identify pale, soft and exudative (PSE; pH, < 6.00)
and dark, frm, and dry (DFD; pHz4 > 6.00) defects, respectively. The color
L*coordinate, a measure of the meat lightness, was significantly lower in groups
pH decline group, which had a lighter color at all measurement times.
Weight losses observed in the fresh meat after packing and cooking, and in
Capocolli at the end of salting and ripening, are reported in Table 30.2. Drip losses 
were significantly higher in the group with a fast rate of pH decline. A similar
trend was observed for cooking losses. However, the differences between groups
with fast pH decline and the other two groups did not become significantly

different until 3 days postmortem (P < 0.05). Even though there was a weak
tendency to show slightly higher losses in the fast pH decline group, there were no
significant differences in weight loss between the three groups of Capocolli after
salting and ripening.
30.4 Discussion
In this study, there were no large variations in pH or signs of PSE or DFD defects.
However, the results confirmed the effect of the rate of pH decline on relevant
traits of fresh pork such as color and WHC (Huff-Lonergan et al. 2002). Fast pH
decline was associated with lighter pork color, which was recorded up to 7 days
after slaughter. Water holding capacity was also reduced by the fast rate of pH
decline, even though the largest differences with slow or nonmal rate of pH decline
were observed at 3 days postmortem. The rate of pH decline did not affect the
technological weight losses of Capocollo salami. There were no differences
between Capocolli produced by pork with different rates of pH decline after a
second salting and curing. This result may be due to several factors, such as a
normal final pH in the all groups or the inclusion of additives during salting. It may
also be due to the simultaneous presence in the cut of the m. longissimus muscle,
with a rapid acidification rate, and other neck muscles such as the m. semispinalis
capitis, with a slow pH decline. Thus, the different rates of pH decline affected

the variation in the rate of pH decline detected in the longissimus thoracis portion
did not cause significant changes in technological losses during Calabrian Capollo
processing.

Preliminary Investigation of the Incidence
of Obesity in a Canine Population
in the USA
G. Biagi, I. Cipollini, M. Grandi, D. Sarti and G. Zaghini
Abstract Obesity represents the most common nutritional pathology in com-
panion animals. At least one-third of the canine population is estimated to be
overweight or obese. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the nutritional
status of a canine population in the USA and assess its correlation with some
specific individual factors. During a period of approximately 2 months, data
concerming nutritional status, dietary management, and clinical situation were
collected for 158 adult dogs. Half of the animals were overweight or obese with an
average body condition score (BCS) of 3.5/5. Factors such as age, neutering,
hormone and chronic arthritic disorders, and breed were significantly positively
correlated with BCS. On the contrary, gender, the presence of other animals and
number of dogs involved, these results confirm that overweight status affects a
large portion of the canine population in the USA and is infuenced mainly by
endogenous factors.

31.1 Introduction
Obesity is currently the most common nutritional pathology among dogs and cats
living in Westem countries (Courcier et al. 2010). Regarding dogs, recent studies
have shown that at least one-third of the canine population is obese, although this
statistic is subject to considerable variation depending on geographical area and
diagnostic criteria used (McGreevy et al. 2005; Colliard et al. 2006; Lund et al.

G. Biagi et al.
2006; Courcier et al. 2010). This pathological condition is secondary to a long-
increase in body weight and change in body composition. Obesity is classified as a
multi-factorial pathology, because it is associated with many risk factors that can
be classified into two main categories: endogenous (breed, gender and reproduc-
tive status, age, and hormonal disorders) and exogenous (diet, exercise, and other
animals prone to numerous pathologies which may cause a substantial decline in
their quality of life and life expectancy. The aim of the present study was to
evaluate the nutritional status of a canine population in the USA and to assess its
correlation with factors that may predispose dogs to obesity and other pathologies.
31.2 Materials and Methods
Data were collected for 158 dogs at Canton Veterinary Hospital in Massachusetts
(USA) in 2009 over a period of 2 months. A form was created to record data
regarding individual factors (age, gender, breed, weight, and reproductive status),
diet (quantity and type of food provided, dry vs. wet food, and commercial vs.
home-prepared food, number of meals per day, and whether snacks and/or left-
overs are offered between meals), physical activity, and the state of health of each
dog. Moreover, nutritional state of each dog was assessed using a 5-point body
condition score (BCS) scale (1 = cachexia, 3 = nonmal and 5 = obese). The
collected data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA, and the differences among
groups were assessed using Student's t test. Finally, the incidence of certain
pathological conditions in relation to BCS (≤3 vs. >3) was detenmined using a
Chi-square test. Differences were considered significant if P < 0.05.

and Shih-tzu (n = 9). Mean BCS was 3.5. 50 % of the dogs examined were
overweight (76 subjects with a BCS of 4 and three subjects with a BCS of 5). Only
three dogs were underweight (BCS of 2), and the remaining 76 were of ideal
weight (BCS of 3). At the time the data were processed, it was decided to exclude
information about the amount of food given and the level of physical activity.
given the low reliability of this information when provided by dog owners.
Whereas gender proved not to have any infuence on BCS, a significantly higher
BCS was observed in neutered dogs (3.6 vs. 3.2; P = 0.003). With respect to age,
the BCS observed in subjects between 1 and 3 years old (BCS 3.3) was lower than

BCS. A lower BCS (BCS 3.1) was observed in subjects fed ad libitum compared to
the others (P = 0.020). Living together with other animals did not appear to have
any infuence on mean BCS. Overweight dogs did show a higher incidence of
several pathologies, such as hormonal disorders (hypothyroidism and hyperad-
renocorticism, P = 0.040) and chronic arthropathies (P < 0.001; Table 31.3).
31.4 Discussion
The high percentage of dogs characterized by a state of overmutrition in the present
study confirms what has recently been reported by other authors, who found the
 prevalence of overweight dogs equal to approximately 60 % of the canine popu-
lation (Courcier et al. 2010). It should be remembered that, in both humans and
dogs, obesity represents a problem that is closely tied to social context and its
174

incidence may vary according to geographical area. Still, if we compare our data
with previous studies, we observe a recent increase in overweight dogs (McGreevy
et al. 2005; Colliard et al. 2006; German et al. 2006). The significant corelations
found in this study among obesity and age, reproductive status, and breed were
previously highlighted by other authors, who observed a significant increase in the
incidence of overweight dogs over 6 years old, in neutered subjects irrespective of
gender, and in certain breeds like Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers, Cocker
Spaniels, Dalmatians, and Rottweilers (Lund et al. 2006). However, the slightly
lower BCS found in crossbred subjects in the present study is in disagreement with
other studies, in which crossbred dogs had a greater predisposition to becoming
overweight (Lund et al. 2006; Courcier et al. 2010). In relation to dietary factors,
the finding of a significantly lower BCS in dogs fed ad libitum contradicts what
was observed in another study, in which a positive correlation was found between
obesity and the number of meals provided daily (Kienzle et al. 1998). However,
although it cannot be ruled out that consuming small meals during the day might
help some subjects to maintain an ideal weight, this kind of dietary regime is
generally adopted by owners of dogs who do not have a voracious appetite and
show little tendency toward gaining weight. Contrary to what one might logically
expect, the present study revealed the lack of any influence of the type of diet or
the habit of giving snacks or leftovers. This is in disagreement with what has been
reported by other authors, who report that snacks and leftovers are among the
factors predisposing dogs to an overweight condition (Kienzle et al. 1998). The
nearly constant finding of a higher BCS in subjects affected by hypothyroidism or
hyperadrenocorticism confinms what was previously observed in a number of
studies (Rijnberk et al. 1968; Daminet et al. 2003) and supports the assumption
that these pathologies play a role in predisposing to obesity. Finally, the significant
correlation between ovemutrition and the presence of chronic arthropathies sug-
gests that, consistent with numerous studies (Impellizzeri et al. 2000; Smith et al.
2006), the latter are likely to be worsened by an overweight condition. Likewise,
the reduction in physical activity of an arthritic dog may contribute to the onset of
an overweight condition. In conclusion, despite the limited number of cases, the
is in an overweight condition and that there are numerous factors, particularly
endogenous ones, which may favor the onset of this condition.

Administration of Essential Oils
Cinnamaldehyde, Eugenol, and Capsicum
to Beef Cattle: Elfects on Health Status
and Growth Performance
R. Compiani, C. A. Sgoifo Rossi, A. Pizzi and V. Dell'Orto
Abstract A 53-day feld trial was performed to evaluate the effects of the
essential oils of cinnamaldehyde, eugenol, and capsicum on the health status and
         s
and blood samples were collected on days 0, 25, and 53. The average daily gain of
the treated group was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of the control. The
treated group showed a significant increase in antibody for BHV-1 after vacci-
nation (P < 0.05 at day 25 and day 53) and significantly higher serum bactericidal
activity (P = 0.0l). No differences between groups were observed for serum
content of haptoglobin or reactive metabolites of oxygen. The observed
improvement in growth performance and health status is due to the capacity of
essential oils to optimize rumen fenmentations, to increase dry matter intake, and
probably to the positive interaction between essential oils and immune system
components

acids produced and the nitrogen ruminal metabolism (Cardozo et al. 2004, 2005;
Busquet et al. 2005, 2006). This study evaluated the effects of the administration of
cinnamaldehyde, eugenol, and capsicum on the growth perfonmance and health
status of fattening cattle during the adaptation phase.
32.2 Materials and Methods
A 53-day feld trial was perfonmed involving 45 male Charolais cattle imported
from France, with an average arrival weight of 422.0 ± 29.3 kg. At arrival
(day 0), animals were randomly divided into two groups, control (n = 21) and
treated (n = 24), and subjected to vaccination against infectious bovine rhi-
notracheitis virus (BHV-l). bovine viral diarrhea Type 1 virus (BVDV).
parainfuenza 3 virus (PI3), and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV).
Cattle were also subjected to antiparasitic treatment with ivermectin. A second
dose of BHV-1 vaccine was administered at day 25. Both groups were fed with
the same unifeed diet administered ad libitum. The diet of the treated group
differed only regarding the addition of a mixture of cinnamaldehyde, eugenol,
53 to obtain its average daily gain (ADG). On days 0, 25, and 53, blood
samples were collected from 10 animals per group for the evaluation of blood
parameters indicating health status, such as titration of antibodies against
BHV-1 by serum neutralization test, serum bactericidal activity, haptoglobin.
and reactive metabolites of oxygen (ROMs). For statistical analysis, each
specific parameter at day 0 was used as a covariate.

32.4 Discussion
Growth performance was better among treated cattle as demonstrated by a sig-
nificantly greater ADG of 130 g. The improved increase is probably due to the
digestive process optimization induced by the treatment. The mixture of essential
oils administered has been shown to improve ruminal fermentation activity and
reduce methanogenesis, thereby reducing energy waste, reducing ammonia con-
centrations, and increasing microbial protein production as demonstrated by
in vitro studies (Cardoz0 et al. 2004, 2005; Busquet et al. 2005, 2006). The effect
of essential oils could be particularly interesting in intensive beef cattle rearing.
because the antimicrobial effect is directly proportional to the ruminal pH drop
from 6.5 to 5.5 (Busquet et al. 2005, 2006; Calsamiglia et al. 2007), a range that
characterizes the fattening cattle diets. Concerming the immune response, essential
oil administration has helped cattle to quickly recover to physiological conditions
after the stressful events typically present in newly received beef calves. Bacte-
ricidal serum activity at day 25 was higher than the threshold of 90 %, and an
improvement in immune response to vaccination was also observed. These posi-
tive effects can be attributed both to the rumen fenmentation optimization and to
180
R. Compiani et al.
the increase of dry matter intake (Yang et al. 2010a, b), but also to a direct effect of
investigated further. The use of essential oils of cinnamaldehyde, eugenol, and
capsicum in newly received beef cattle diet seems to be a successful strategy to
improve growth performance and immune response during the adaptation phase.

Abstract This research aimed to evaluate the effect of extruded linseed in the diet
of grazing goats on milk concentrations of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA). Thirty
dairy goats were divided into two groups: C, control and L, which received
extruded linseed in the concentrate. Milk yield and fat percentage did not differ
between groups, whereas group L showed higher (P < 0.05) levels of total CLA
and c9tl1CLA. The results were affected by sampling month; Indeed, the differ-
ences were significant in July when linoleic and linolenic acids in the pasture
decreased.

33.1 Introduction
The increasing interest in the nutritional characteristics of food has led to the study
of their lipid components, in particular, to a class of isomers derived from con-
jugated linoleic acid (CLA), which are known to have antioxidant and anticarci-
nogenic properties in animal models (Parodi 1999). In the rumen, CLA production
comes from the bio hydrogenation of linoleic and linolenic acids (both charac-
terized by a structure with cis-9 and cis-12 dienes, and a free carboxyl group).
Thus, the presence of these precursors in the animal diet affects milk CLA content.
with important roles attributed to grazing pasture (Banni et al. 1996; Dhiman et al.
1999; Cabiddu et al. 2004) and/or linseed supplements (Nudda et al. 2006). This

research aimed to evaluate the effects of adding extruded linseed to the diet of
grazing goats on milk concentrations of CLA.
33.2 Materials and Methods
The trial was carried out on 30 pregnant Cilentana dairy goats (50 ± 2.5 kg body
weight) divided into two groups (C, control, and L, receiving linseed), homoge-
neous for parity and milk yield at the previous lactation. All goats were fed
ad libitum oat hay, and 200, 300, and 400 g/head/day of concentrate [crude protein
(CP) 18 % of dry matter (DM); 1.03 unit feed for lactation (UFL)/kg DM] 45, 30,
and 15 days before kidding, respectively. Group L received concentrate containing
extruded linseed (30 % as fed). After kidding (first week of February), both groups
had free access to pasture (9.00 am-4.00 pm), constituted by 60 % Leguminosae
(Trifolium alexandrinum, Vicia spp.) and 40 % grass (Bromus catharticus, Festuca
arundinacea, and Lolium perenne). The supply of concentrate was gradually
increased to 700 g/head/day. From days 0 to 60, milk was suckled only by the
kids; successively, daily milk yield was recorded, and monthly representative milk
samples from the two daily milkings were analyzed for protein, fat, and lactose
concentrations (Milko Scan 133B, Foss Matic, Hillerod, Denmark) and CLA
content (D'Urso et al. 2008). Pasture samples (four samplings) were collected
monthly from three areas (2.5 m? each) at a height of 3 cm above the ground and
analyzed for chemical composition (AOAC 2000; Van Soest et al. 1991) and fatty
acid profiles (D'Urso et al. 2008). The nutritive value was calculated (MFU/kg
DM; INRA 1978). Data were analyzed by the GLM procedure and differences of
means compared by the Tukey test (SAS 2000).
33.3 Results
The pasture had 16.6 % CP and 0.76 MFU/kg DM on average. The samples
collected in July showed lower values of linoleic and linolenic acids than those in
the 2 months before, whereas for both acids, the highest value was registered in
September (Table 33.1).
Average milk yield and chemical composition (Table 33.2) did not differ
between groups. As expected, along the trial, milk yield gradually decreased; the

percentage of protein decreased slightly at the fourth sampling. Regarding the fat
content, the highest values were registered at the second and ffth sampling.
Group L showed significantly (P < 0.05) higher concentrations of total CLA
and c9 t11 CLA than group C (Table 33.3).
33.4 Discussion
The influence of diet containing extruded linseed supplementation on CLA content
of goat milk has also been reported by others (Nudda et al. 2006). In our trial, the
higher value of total CLA in milk of grazing goats fed extruded linseed was
attributed to c9 tllCLA content. In addition, the results were affected by the
sampling month (Figs. 33.1 and 33.2). Indeed, the differences between groups
were signifcant only in July, when, due to climatic conditions, the pasture is less
luxuriant with lower concentrations of both linoleic and linolenic acids.
